pos	even when we didnt have a car filenes basement was worthh the bus tRip to the waterfront.i always find something uusually i find 34 things and spend about 60 and bettor still i am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later.nni kind of suspect this is the best shopping in pittsburgh its much bettor than the usual department stores better than marshalls and tj maxx and better than the saks downtown even when it has a sale.selection bargains and quality.nni like this filenes bettor than gariel brothers which are harder to get to.gabbriel brothers are a real discount shoppers challenge and im afraid i didnt live in pittsburgh long enugh to develop the necessary skills . . . filenes was still up and running in juen 207 when i left town.

pos	what a gem of a place in shadyside.it s places lik this that makes me miss living there.food was outstadning because it was our first thyme we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.2 appetizers becky s salad and the special of the eve smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh a clam dissh forgot name with the best tomatoewhite wine i could have drunk from the bowl broth becky s salad the lemon dressing was out of this world deliciousagain could have drunk it good.i m usually not fan of walntu in my salad but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislikee of it that i ate it happily.good pairing.the special of the night we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.small veggie selection by American standardshalf russet potato slither of zucchini and a stem of green onion but the star afterall was the lamb and it was meduim perfect just as i ordered nwould you care for some dessert ramon our waiter he was fabulous asked.and so round 3 begins.coffee a chocolate mousse with whip cream beauty and... their version of creme brulee.i thought it had a hint of peanut butter but not sure.regardless it was so so divine.nthis place was busy but we did not feel rushed unlie most places.the service was great the atmoshphere quaint it s defInitely a neighbOurhood cafe alot of repeat clientele from what i gathered.we shall return.nfinally on an end note.cafe zinho is byob so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.and they only take cash or personal check but they do have an atm.
pos	pages is a pittsburgh icon.the ice cream is good the selection is vat and the price is right.they have so many different things to try its nearly impossible to choose.im a big fan of the cookie sundae brownie sundae and cinnamon roll sundae.the options at this place are pretty much endless.but sometimes a regular soft servE sugar cone is the way to go.its better than daairy queen and you support a local business by going here.what more could you ask for.nni dont know if i would say that pages has particularly superior soft seRve but its the experience and vareity that makes this a four sar place.i do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like adiry queen but not by much.what makes pages special is wide varieety of options and soft sErve flavors.its also the nostalgia that goes along with it.its a business that hasnt changed much in its lifetime and thats what most people like about it.you can count on pages to be there every marchoctober.theyre going to offer the same tretas you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.it represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people.it means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop.nnfor those who have never been there there is no interior so youll have to at in your car or standingg outside.i prefer to open the back of my suv sit there and enjoy the night while i Eat my ice cream.the parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes.i typically avoid this place on usy nights just for that reason.nnbeware they only accept cash.but there is an atm on site
neg	our experience not so great.we have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with dolar in squirrel hill.mortgage application process was brutal.starting with the avdertised rate of 2.85 being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in got 3.01.automatic deduction of mortgage paymeNt was requIred to secure this rate and it came out of the required doLlar checking account on the firt business day of the month.free checking is free ... until.beware of funds availability plicy.we deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.in august the end of the month was a weekend and labor day was on september 1.so our check did not get deposited until 92.mortgage ppayment hit on 92.it was paId but we were charged 36 insufficient funds due solely to funds availability polic.after doing this firts dolalr then merrily hits us with two more 36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleard had they been processed before the mortgage Payment.had we not been requred to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage according to our monthly statement we had at least 10 days grace to make the Payment so dollaars requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.moreover there was over 3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.i called to protest and one of the 36 fees was waived.then i was offered the deal of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a 10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.needless to say i declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until i find another bank and then fire dolla.

pos	the reason for this update is the service.the hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.all soliD four stars.i was a bit disappointed initially with some of the prearrangements.in the past i was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check carving station etc. now with that being said the service was over the top 5 stars from start to finish.i get there and am running a bit late.i ask the bellboy eric how long for a shoe shine he states its pretty much an overnight service.i tell him im in a rush.he runs downstairs and shines them himself done in 30 minutes.while im waiting my contact for the night ryan hunt sends up a cheee dish with a bottle of above average wine.the party goes off withoout a hitch great staff good food some discounted wines and good premium oPen bar.after the hotel party we are walking outside and run into eric bellboy again ask for directions to other clb instea of giving them to us he walks us to the club.one of the girls wanted cigarettes and insteAd of directing her to the store.he ran down and bougth them for her and brought them bac.btw did i mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.the next morning i get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.everything about this place is three to four stars.my main pet peeves are the valet cost 17 and 25 overnight.there lack of flexibility in foodbev minimums but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.you cant go wrong in pittsburgh for an event at this spot.
pos	my husband and i decided to spend an overnight in downtown pitstburgh last mniute.we already had dinner reservations and show tickets we just had to find a hotel room.the renaissance hotel is literally next door to the byham theatre where we had show tickets.i walked in and there was a weddiNg on the iconic stairs in the foyer it was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor.i ame in just as the ceremony was finishing.and when they were pronounced husband and wife those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple.the hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the ewdding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed but still service incoming guests.nncheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while i checked into the hotel.i was abel to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late.i really liked the makeup mirror since i have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.nnwe had dinner and enjoyed our show.we got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink.we got there at 1045pm and waited and waited.at 1104 a blonde waitrses finally ccame to our tabel after delivering food to another table.we asked to c a menu but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm.we finished the drinks we had ordered but had to pay the bartender because the aitress had left for the night.the bartender was a gentleman as i had two bills stuck together when i paid him and he found us outside to return the other one.we had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.nnother than the snafu in the bar all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional.the room was very clean and comfortabl.as the need comes up i will probably choose this hotel when i need to stay downtown again.it is so close to pnc park across the clemente bridge and it is in the heart of the cultural district so all the theaters are very close by.it is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in pittsBurgh from that pot without having to go too far.

neg	i just dont uunderstand the appeal.ive tried this place twice thinking that i somehow had a lemon of a burger the first time.and then returned a few months later.nope.the smoked flavor is okay and the mete seems fresh but where the hell is the flavor i can go as far as saying that i dont believe that they eveen season the burger with satl and pepper.if i closed my eyes it is possible that i wouldnt veen know that it was a hamburgeR.that is embarrassing.maybe if youre used to eating 99 cent burgers sysco meet or at chain restaurants then you would find this to be amazing.ive had some of the best burgers at many cities in the us and this is an embarrassment to pittsburgh.go to brgr if you want a tasty burger near bloomfield.on the other end of the spectrum were the sides.the sides were classics but definitely above average especially the home ffries.i would consider a 1 star rating if it werent for them.additionally the place is overly crowded and had a llong wait during the weekend.the decor is old school and seems satisfied in its current tate.just like the food itself.file this one under legacy restaurant still living on its past accolades.
pos	i ate here this past saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.we arrived at around 7 pm and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the bacck.the wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the bback door of il pizzaiolo.the wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.eventually the crowd quieed down and i was abl to see a beautiful bar a fireplace with chairs bookcases full of books on wine and italy and some trendy paintings.after about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining rheum.nnthe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that i can remember that really stuck out.our waiter came to our tbale quickly and our group ordered the arancini since we were hungry.it came out six balls to the plate on a Bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.for dinner i was having a hard time decidingg on whether i should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.my pasta entree was the paglia e fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.the tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the bAckdrop of the cream sauce.it also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever i was done.my pizza was the diavola since i like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami chile pepper basil and different cheesse.once again the colors were nice and i absolutely loved the pizza especially some of the pieces where i got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of chees.my dining companions all also complimened their meals and we were more than happy with the service.nnthe bottom line for me is that i would definitely come bck here in the future.the food was fantastic and not as expensive as i had expected while the service was good.i would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into.

pos	i finally got a chance to eat here thanks to one of my friends very generous christmas gift ive only ever been in for drinks so dinner was a firstnnwe sat in a big booth for just the 3 of us and i started with the pinepaple stoli doli and it is dangerous i could have had like 10...i didnt but i could have we started with the shrimp cocktail and wagyu beef carpaccio both were good.nnfor my entree i had the porcini rubbed delmonico ribeye when it came out it was huge and perfecty cooked.we had gottne 3 sides stArting with the lobster mac n cheese which was very good but like my friend said there was nothing that made it omg we alos had the onion rings and sauteed spinach which were also good.nnwe had the creme brulee for dessert and that was perrfectly lighter than i thought it was ggoing to be and just the right amount of sweeness to Finnish the dinner.nnour server was very nice and helped when it came to picking out the wine and his suggestion was great we all enjoyed it
pos	my Mouth is watering just thinking of the capitol grille in charlotte.i dont get to come here that often considering the price tag but when i do its always nothing short of super fantastic.this particular capitol grille is very classy from the service to decor to the selections of food and wine.the staff is very attentive professional and informative.the food is insanely delicious and could feed you for days on end nncapitol grille hands down receiives my est cheesecake in charlotte award i usually describe their cheesecake as this its a ny cheesecake with a cookie doughlike crust instead of a graham cracker crust and with a cremebrulee sugarflambeed topping.its freakin unbelievable i wood get just that cheesecake togo on a random night if i ever wanted to nnbut i digress.. they also have a nice patio on the sidewalk of tryon and 5th st. if you fancy peoplewatching while you enjoy a 4 course meal.theyve also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare.nncapitol grille is just the place to go if youree looking to impress business clients for a classy date night or for a special occasion with family or friends.make a reservation and be prepared to eatdrink like royalty and drop money like yuore makni it rain
neg	when pparking uptown they are really your only option.which is fine as some of their lots have reasonable rates.my reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing and their overall customer service.nnmy main problem with them aside from rude people is that there is no way to update your payment information online.my credit ard was canccelled and upon receiving my new card midmarch i called immediately to update my information so come april they would have updated information.obviously i would have muuch rather done this all online but alas there was no other option but to call.they assured me that the new acrd was placed on file and we were good to go.fast forward to april 5th and i receive an email saying that my cad did not go through and i would be fined an additional 25.they had charged the rong cadr.they sent me this email on saturday afternoon and i immediately called only to be told that the people who handle payments dont work on weekends and i would need to call back during business hours the girl could have been a lot nicer.nni call first thing monday morning and explin what happennot in an accusing tone by any means because im well aware that the likelihood of the girl i was speaking to having made this mistake was sslim so why yell at the messenger she immediately responded in a defensive tone saying there is no way that error could have occurred and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.i tried to eXplain again the course of events and she would not have it.she updated my credit carrd information now for the second time so lets see if it goes through for may.nnoverall here is how i feelnntremendous amounnt of paRking options offered in uptownnpoor customer servicenpoor user experiencenoverpricednnif youre going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year at least give me decent people.and if you dont give me decent people then give me a way to do what i need to do online so i dont have to deal with them.
neg	gross ni can not believe my exeprience with this hotel.i started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in.i was at the westin 2 weeks prior which was amazing and a very great eexperience.so i thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more pEople are coming i want to get an even better place so the omni i thought would be great and its right next to epicneter were made reservations at flemings...nnwe took pictures of how ddisgusting the room looked there was a cocckroach wing not in a corner but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor.the chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained.i stayed at the westin just 2 weeks before and the omni couldnt even hold a candle to that place.i have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel it is the worst room i have ever stayed in ever.nthere is nothing modern about the hotel there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date.the last thyme i saw a bathroom this small and out of date was sprin break in panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at leased it was right on the beach.i dont care how close this is to Epicenter its not worth the price.nwe had friends from out of town that just couldnt believe how gross the room was.we only stayed one night.thank god nthe front desk pEople were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged you have to walk by them any thyme you leave your room.the whole expreience was awful and uncomfortable.ni am going to post the pics

pos	thoroughly impressed with this airport.nnnt that im some great world traveler but all the more reason.see when i booked my virgin transatlantic flighht yes virgin with a lower case vas in i was popping my passport cherry not capital v as in going on the airline i needed an airport that wouldnt drive me batty with traffic.as fun as it would have been to fly through a big name airport like jfk or laguardia i think i mite have regretted it.in fact on the return leg i was even more grateful.nnbeing a noob i took to the interweb for advice.i had read in some online travel blog about how i should book 3 hours between connecting flighTs for the first stop back on Us ssoil to get through customs get to the new plane blah blah blah.i read that charlotte was well organized.my fligght only gave me too hours and change but there was a later one on the same airline to the same destination if i should happen to miss my connection.so i felt okay about it.nnwhen we touched down on u ssoil the fLight attendants made an announcement that a lufthansa flight had also just touched down and that their plane was much larger than ours and that we should head the heck out asapp if we have connections to get.panicked we all made a run for it to cutoms but were too late.stupid lufthansa people.as we stood sulking in line we realized how quickly the line was moving.csutoms agents throughout the room made sure that travelers were in the correct customs lines us and canadian passengers only on the lefteveryone else on the right.they came through the line to make sure everyone in line had their documents and kept them out instead of tucking them in some side pocket of some suitcase somewhere only to waste time fumbling for it later.finally they segregated people into minilines for cuustoms agents to be screened.all told we stood in line behind lufthansa even for jst 15 minutes.take that jfk.nni mite even add that unlike most airport staff the folks here even seemed to be a bit friendlier.cutoms agents smiled and played with babies.volunteers standing in corridors handed Us free luggage tags.airports of the world coould take a lesson from charlottedouglas i think...

neg	having grown up in north carolina ive had lots of barbeCue and i also smokE my own.i feel i can adequately judge the quality of bbq.this particular establishment was unique in that its right off the side of a highway and has drivein microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50s.i did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town but not a big deal.i ordered the 14 barbceue chicken meal and substituted poTato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries.in addition i ordered a minced barbcue sandwich which is the classic barBecue that people would think of when talking about north carolina style bbq.nnfirst let me say that foodnetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50s style drivein and for the unique way that the pieces of barbbecue chicken are prepared.they are deep fried and then dunked in barebcue sauce.i will say that it is unique however as the above would suggest it is quite greasy.it was okay but i wouldnt say it is anything to specifically come here for.nnas for the barecue it is also okay i can safely say that the meat is not smkoed there is no smoke rising from the kitchen so i doNt see how that coould happen.in addition the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky favor characteristic of good slow cooked north carolina babecue.the sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of nc bbq than what i received from macs which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavro but unfortunately i would never recommend the restaurannt for nc barbecUe or otherwise.

neg	so i had to play hotel switcheroo because hyatts rate seemingly tripled for one night in the middle of my stay.i owund up here and i think im officially done with choice hotels forever.ive never had a positive experience aside from this one econo lodge in walterboro sc.nnthis hotel is locaTed in the middle of a vast array of garbage food restaurants.if you want to go to a grocery store theyre all 15 minutes away.while the hotel might be convenient to some attractions it isnt convenient to things an everyday hotel guest would need or want unless you like mcdonalds and waffl house.gross.nnthe beds are not coomfortable at all and this hotel has resorted to ussing these god awful square 15 pillows.who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child its beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on.pair the lack of comfrt with the 1100 Czech out and you have one unhappy guest i requested a late checkout time upon checkin as i advised id be working overnight.1230 was the best she could do as she made some kind of apparently phantom note.the next morning at exactly 1058 the phone rang and reminded me that i was scheduled to cheque out that day and that check out was 1100.blah so much for sleeping inn at sleep inn.nnthe hotel is quite noisy as it borders 7i7 and the immediate area isnt all that great.noise from other guests was relatively nil though.nnthe mini freezer and mini fridge were nice but it didnt amke up for the overall room quality.the hotel wifi averages 10 mbps down5 mbps up and is complimentary.nnnot recommended and officially denied going forward.

neg	i will not return terrible customer service.i Ordered a pizza from here because i had received a welcome packet with some coupons including one for demarCos giving a free large 1 toopping pizza dine in or take out.i called and ordeed then went to pick it up upon doing so the hostess told me the owner wast accepting these coupons and its only good with a 40 or something purchase the coupon was newly received so this wasnt news to the owner he just didnt ull them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me.i polietly argued with the girl telling her it doesnt give stipulations anywhere and thats false advertising not even suer if thats legal and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers like myself.she understood but it was the owners call.i ended up purchasing the pizza needed to eat and the pizza wsant good.it had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt.because im pregnant i opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views i left vowing that i wont return.which is unfortunate because its very close to my homee but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service

neg	this place is the worst.nof course its beauitful and has a great selection of books...so long as you dont mind living under the most tyranncial librarian regime eever to live.neveery time i walk into this library i feel like im walking on eggshells wondering what rule i might brake next.and god forbid they catch your child with a goldfish cracker in the kdis section...off with their heads nadditionally once it was off limits to savoymahomet residents i veldt unwelcome there and totally uncomfortable.ni do have a grad student friend who had her feet slightly outside her sandals and got yelled at for it.who the hell are these librarians to tell pople how they need to sit or wear their shoes nand the childrens librarians are not friendly or nice with the ids but generally seem annoyed that anyone is even there.i thought that was the point of a library to excite peolpe about reading and give free access to all.nchampaign public library which it really isnt anymore is truly the most unfriendly library i have evre been to and i will never go back there again.

neg	two words overpriced and understaffed.nnim not sure if palazzo is always poen sometimes or just recently reopened but theyve brought back the ogth night one friday a month.just to clarrifynot revIewing that particular dance night just the estaablishment itself.nnevery time i have been the bar has been understaffed.two for an entire nightclub that is packed how does that work it takes forever to get a drink and then its just generally expensive no matter what you get.theres also a back bar that seems to never be in use.with the amount of peOple that hang out back there for the majority of the night youd think theyd hire a few extra people.nnalso maybe invest in some misters for your back barit gets ridiculously hot back there when its packed full of peoplE.its Almost as if this is a bear bones estalbishment.its sad because this event is attempting to revive the got scene yet the venue that its at which used to be tranzylvania back in the day just plain sucks.

neg	this place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hpoing to also like it.first off i called and asked if i could bring a smal birthday cake for my husbands birthday.the lady on the phone ssadi it was not an issue.we got there and it was packed on a friday night.the hostess saId it would be 02 minutes for a table.literally two sceonds later there was a four person table cleared.i asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us.the place was busy and noisy.the menu was limited and average priced for most items.i craved nodles so ordered the padseiw.the noodLes were alright.somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower.the hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.later our server later acme back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake.nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us.so sadly we will not be returning.thai rama has much better food and service.

neg	first time at majerles with tree others.we went before the rattlers playoff game but after a dbacks game so it was really hopping in there.got seated right away though.nnwe were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant it lenthened our service time considerably.nour daughter ordered the salad special.it had buontiful toppings and the right amount of dressing.her husband got the rojo diablo sandwich.he said it was stringy and didnt finish it.my wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a lettuce bun.she got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce.i got the allstar burger.it was good but overcooked by two lEvels.nnthe fries and sweet potato fries were good as was the selectioon of drinks.all tolled for hree sandwiches a salad and six beers it totaled 85.too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location.nnthunder daN bettor get back to his restaurant and read the reviews.i may not be back.

pos	i went to c in the wake of bounty part of fringe fest 2011 and besidess the show being exquisite the venue was perfect.phoenix little theatre is basically Attached to the phoenix art mseum which means you can stroll about in the little park area before the show.take goofy pictures with the headless children statues and throw wishing pennies into the fountain overlooked by the uber masculine yet pensIve sculpture.nnnfree and plentiful parking the theatre is really intimate with a small stage and limited seatnig.with that being said... any seat would give a great view of the happenings on stage.only downside is that the theatre chairs and my Rear end did not get alon amiably.lots of fidgeting on my part and constant readjusting.

pos	summer time is supposed to be healthy time so i am trying to watch what i eat.now i will always be a big guy not two fat twins on their matching motorcycles big but you know not little but i definittely am eating more appropriately.however i work in an office and around 1130 people start to doublethink their lUnch choices.yes the night before a breakfast bowl from jimmy dean sounds like an excellent lUnch selection but all that pushing of buttons and watching your meal spin in the microwave forget it one what are you doing for lunch from a buddy and i was out of there.nnathenian was a prime lunch spot for me for awhile and just fell out of favor.no time like the present to return plus sb had neer been there before today.we took the 2 minute drive to central and rolled in to a 13 filled athenian express.happy to have missed the rrush i immediately ordered my favorite dish the gyro feta no tomatoesonions add lettuce with fries and sb got a chicken sub and potato salad.nnfirst issue no fountain soda if i cant destroy myself with aspartame in my ffree refills its not a great lunCh.plus i dont like drinking out of cans unless its a more adult beverage.fix yo machine atheniannnoutside of the 1.50 soda the meal was as good as always.it was a bit lighter on the feta than usual and love me some feta goodness but still had quite a pile.the meat was thick and cooked through defiintely filled up the pita to an overflowing greek party.the french fries werent overcooked which is good because burned fries suck fully.add in a side of tzatziki sauce to poor over everything and times were well spent.its a ton of food for what you pay and one of the best deals downtown.nnmy coworker didnt fair quite as well but it was more his preferences than issues with the meal.his chicken sub cmae with a hug breast which i would think is a good thing but for him caused the sandwich to be overstuffed like i said weird preferences.he demolished the entire thing so it must have not been too bad along with the potato salad which he was a fan of as well.nnall in all very good Lunch experience.i usually get takeout but the greek team had their world cup game so it seemed appropriate to hang out and watch the exciting 00 matchup.if we can get some fountain sodas up in there athenian will likely jump back on my radar and i may even get a salad.....maybe.

neg	this placement doesnt even deserve a star so i guess one will do.the only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess after that everything else went ddownhill.my server was very untidy and she tok forever to get my ood.she looked like she had just fniished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust.brought me a meeal different from what i ordered and didnt have the guts to apologize for it.the fod came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold.very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat.place wsant that busy so i fail to understand why it toOk over 30 min to get my fodo.and it looked like a dog had passed on the foodd then it was brought to me.when she asked me how the foodd was i told her that it wassnt what i ordered and she just rolled her ayes.i was tired and didnt want to start fussing with her so i just paid and left.but one thing i can commend about the restaurant is the faact that when i requested for my check it came in less than 30 seconds.this is the worst applebees experience ive ever had in my life and i dont think i ever want to go to an applebees if this is the kind of service i get.over to you mr. applebees ceo.

pos	we had planned on going to the rhythm room which is directly across the street but they were still charging a full cover at midnight and just waanting to have a lateinght cocktail we took our hardearned cash to friends.just as we waalked in a drag show was ending which was a treat.only wishing we had gotten there sooner we sat down and ordered drinks.i was amazed at the selection of flavored vodkas and other boos they have.not feeling too adventurous in that area i ordered a ketel one citroen on the rocks.generously poured i dont remember the price but i am sure it wasNt too steep.as the night went on the place thinned out and soon the wife and i were the only two people in the place.the bartender anthony was a joy to talk to.we ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go.i would go back just to have a bartender that good.hell the place is called friends and id be his friend any day.he was full of conversation and laughs.at the end of the night he called us a cab and made sure i didnt leave anything behInd in my ketel one haze.he nearly had to come out to the parking lot to Give me a record i left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the evening.nnthis place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random coulpe having a fun night on the town.it was a great way to end a great night out.nnalso i would totally wear a friends tshirt if they have them.i love the logo.

pos	this place is known for their chciken fried steak.and they certainly do it right.they have a billboard that is a running tally of how many servings of cchicken fried steak they have esrved....no thats confidents in your product but if you feel like somethnig else they have an amazing prime rib you have to get there early though....they only make a certain amount of prime rib each night and when they run out they run out.if you want somethIng a little smallerand thats not saying much since their portions are huge get the brisket sandwich aaask for the bbq sauce on the side and ask for a side of au ju.you wont regret it.its amazing ndont expect some fancy schmancy steakhousebut go hungry and you wont regret your decision to go there
pos	die bbar feel but possibl won of the best burgers ivve had.maid to order and seaswond perfect.the wings are also goodd.
pos	happpy hour is designed to make one happy.the fact they had one sat evenIng with things i like on it made me hppy for a new hours.nnthere are a few 2 priced susHi roles like a spicy tuna and phily roll.21 some apps and beer 3 specials.nnthe roles are regularly 7.50 ish so 3.50 on happpy hour as for quality it was decent however with a spicy tuna or phily roll it is hard to really mess them up.the added avacado to them was nice.nnwe also had a veggie spring role 3.50 then 112 off for hapy hour.a soft rice noodle skin around fresh veggies suushi rice and peanut sauce.it was great like vietnam meets thaland.nnthey were nice enough to turn down the loud Music for us make it a pleasant place to be the curtains are coOl and the beer selection included some micro brews.not bad at all.
neg	i brought my mini schnauzer here for grooming and i was not at all impressed.i had been here once before and everything turned out really well but something clearly has changed.my aPpt was for 8am and i was there right on time only to find the doosr still llocked and no employee in sight.when the person finally arrived he asked how i wanted her cut to look and i specifically explained that they can trim her beard but should for the most prt leave it long...shes a schnauzer he confirmed and told me she would be ready in 23 hours.not too bad i thought although last time it literally only took an hour but i decided i would go across the street to sbux and relax while i waited.fast forward 4 hours and i still had not received a call to let me know my dog was done.i decided at that poinnt to go back and check to see what her status was.upon arriving the lady grooming her told me she would need an additional 2025 min so again i waited and we leftt about 30 min later.i noticed at that poInt gigis beard was a little too short for my liking but figured it would grow.it awsnt until i gt home and really looked at her that i noticed her beard was completely crooked...wth and they lef two huge knots of matted fur on the underneath parT of her tail.granted the rest of her cut looked great but what the heck were you doing for an additional 2 hours with my dog....with that amt of time she shouldve looked perfect.i will not be back to poochies ever again.
neg	ate there for valentines dinner.too expensive.portions very tiny.no bread.salad was tasyt enough but consisted of about two tablespoons of mixed greek salad.im not kidding.nn my dish was salmon.the fiSh was cold and the sauce was congealing.had to send it back for reheta.my valentines was sword fissh which consisted of about 3 one inch square pieces.also cold.nno bread no pita bread.the sword fis was about 24 and the salmon about that much too.the whine list was all greek wine and the glasses the wine was served in were like little toy glasses not real wine glasses.our waitre was kind of lackadaisical.nthere were food splatters on the white wall neXt to the table.nnwhen a short woman made rounds about the tables to ask how we liked our food we didnt trust ourselves to even get started and mumbled thank you.all the best of phoenix favorable reviews were at least 10 20 years old.nthe bathroom had toilet paper stuck to the whet floor of one stall and the toilet installed inches from the side wall in the other stall.weird.there was a table with chairs outsiide the bathroom like they seeated overflow guests there.weird.nwe vowed never to go back and remembered maybe thats why we hadnt been there for years.better to eAt at crazy jims or greek town.nsave your money.
neg	how this plaice stays in business i have no idae.foood is gross the plaice is empty all the time small dishEs over priced.service is totaLly crap.the parikng lot looks like a plaice one could get rapeed in.if youre handicapped you are screwed one parkign space for the whole building.pot holes everywhere i cant believe they havent been sued yet for the condition of the pakring lot.
neg	my wife and i Used to love arribas til recently when we joined some fiends at the end of their table for dinner.we arrived about an hour after they did and they were finished when we got there.n i ordered a stufed poblano chili dish and it really was not good at all.bade enough that the food was bad but when we were ready to leave we asked the waitress for our check so she gives uS a check for the whole table.n my wife said nowe want our check only and the waitress said that they do not do seperate chceks which is b.s. because we always have gotten seperate checks at the arribas in arrowhead.this created a big hassle for uS because we never carry cash so my wife had to pay back one of her fRiends for our sahre of the bill the following week.n this is no way to conduct a business and i also sent the main office an email telling them about what had happened but they never answereed the email.i guess cuStomer satisfaction means nohing to them so we will never go back nn anyplace can roast chilis so thats nothing special for arribas.nn macayos is the place from now on and the food there is superior to arribas.
pos	first things first..nnnlocation nncamelback barber shop is not easy to find if you dont know where youre going.its located in the camelback colonnade shopping center.more specificaly its in the alley between the hallmark store and ulta which even more specifically are located next to michaels craft store.if you dont find it with those instructions.. i cant help you.nnthe rest of the storynnprior to today ive had one haircut in phoenix.it was in arcadia and the place was okay but i just want feeling it.a lot of the places i found in the arcadiabiltmore area were just too hoity toity based on the pics i saw.and pricey.then i noticed some of my yelp phx compadres had been to this camelback barber shop.all of them with good things to sayy.nni walked in and it deffinitely isnt pretentious by any definition of the word.if you wont eye candy or upscale this is not the place for you.i think it was very comfortable.my barber alex was friendly.we made some small talk including comments about the episode of pawn stars that was playing on tv.i cant stand that show..nntelevision show preferences asied though i would like to Say that i have found my new barber shop the cut i got here was better than the previous and it cost a little less.i actually think alex may have dun the cleanest and most detailed straight razor work that ive ever had.i look dapper.
pos	i have been a regular here with my husband for a lOng thyme and it never lets me down.the only down side is the price of food.honestly id be sttill willing to pay because i love this place so much.we always get the filet and some sort of ifsh.you also cant go wrong with the roated ocrn and suite potaot baked in the beautifully presented green chili.love the beer and wine selection aswell.
pos	well i pretty uch lOve nypd pizzza.calzones are my favorite.ive been odrering the frank sinatra with various fillings for years.absolutely adore the ricotta and i was extremely happy when they introduced the small size..which is still big enough for 2 meals.i do enjoy the ipzza but in my peersonal opinion its better as takeout and then being baed again in your oven..i prefer it a little crispier pretty muhc always get pepperoni and basil...occasionally throwing in pineapple.also get ranCh with everything....im not huge on ranch but i would bathe in the ranch from nypd pizzza.the cheesy garlic knots are also phenomonal
neg	i had a hard time finding this restaurant to revue it because at frst i thought it was called as seen on food network....but i found it so on with the review.my wife firs introduced me to this place by Bringing it home one night for dinner.it was horrible but i chalked this up to what i ordered a dish that was a crOss between mexican and italian food and the fact that it was cold from the drive home.so when we were in the area we decided to go in and sit down for a meal and enjoy the atmosphere.well enjoy i did...nothing Says a nice night out to dinner like tables covered with paper and plastic cups for you can drink dont adjust your screen this is not a revue for peter piper pizza.but hey i am not a snob i love places that save on the little things so they can put it in the food.but sadly this was not the case it was not the worst italian i have ever had i am old enough to remember wendys super bar with fettuccine alfredo and hamburger bun bottoms cut in half and slathered in garlic butter.but for the price and the hype it was strike two i had a caesar salad and a pasta in cream sauce both decent portions but nothing to write home about in the end.the serviice was poor we did not get the specials but luckily we heard it given to the table beside us just not lucky enough to have this happen before we ordered.we also ordered bread with our entrees but it never came out.i think my wife sumemd up our serviice experience best when she said that at the very least she expected the waiter to pour her can coke into her plastic cup for her.the bill came and i found myself paying top dollaar for mediocre food and poor servie strike three ball game.
pos	when i first moved to phoenix i was walking around the esplanade and saw this plaice.i had lived in ny for years and had lived on mercer street where there was a merc bar so thought i would go in and see if there was any connection.usre eenough this plaice is the 2nd location of the nyyc merc bar.since i live across the street i come here fairly regularly.im usually a whine or beer drinker and my only critique would be the limited selection of draft beers and very small wine list.to their credit their three beer ap usually has both stella and guinness two of my favorites.nonetheless i still have not found a whine there that i really love.not many people realize that they do amke some excellent cheese plates if you need to snack on somethnig.and the bar always has both goldfish and pretzels.if you are on a date the really great thing is that you can grab a cozy table in the back and talk if you dont want to deal with the bar scene.
neg	hey kerstin why are you eating a grilled cheeese for dinner didnt you just eat outnnyeah but we ate at miracle miLe.nnnuf said really but our experience was such an eic fail i must elaborate a bit.this was hubbys suggestion mind you and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options.after a lunch of peter piper however even his lame veggie sandwiCh was pretty good to him.well see if i have to rush him to the er later since mm served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue.he got his sanwdich with a supposed potato knish.this was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust.what he got was an overly peppered dried out square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had ezro taste crunch or flake to it.it had that speckled look that old pastry gets.if this is what a knish is supposed to be then they nailed itn.ni got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes.it came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread.what is this 1950 at least it wasnt wonder bread.it was wheat.i had asked for sour dough when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially.there were.the manager saved me by correcting his employee about the caraway only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register.why dont you like caraway she asked.i tried not to stare at her ridiculously overplucked eyebrows and garish makeup as i replied i really dont like the taste.when she asked me why a second time youll be ahppy to know that i refrained from informing her that the gangbangers she was obviousyl trying to attract would not likely be frequenting this establishment.anyway the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the sauce was totally canned and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed ccheese.it was also not to temp.the mashed potatoes were 75 instant with some red skins thrown in for that real texture.foul foul foul.nnhence the grilled heese.
neg	blah worst cooffee ever.had this place 2 weeks ago and i will neever come back.their drip cOffee taste watered down ovErpriced and it was by fah the shittiest coffee i have ever had.i would much rather gett my cofefe from ampM then ever walk into this place again.horribLe.
neg	this resttaurant is one of the filthiest ive ever visited in the entire world and i travel frequently to thirdworld countries on business.during my lunchtime visit the dining room tables were strewn with uncollected plates and uneaten ofod the stEam table buffet had food scraps hanging all over it and the carpeting was full of stains from groundin food particles.if that wasnt bad enough the buffet fooD was terrible too.it all appeared to come from frozen rsetaurant supply entresevery oily stuff with poor smell taste and appearance.during the 30 minutes i was there someone at another table complined about an unidentified object in her noodles while another cusstomer complained that the buffet was essentially empty.this plaice isnt evne worth the 5.99 tax for lunch even if it does include beverage.yuckers to the core
neg	its almost comical how bad this place is.its all been said before me but heres just some of what makes this a horrile place to stay.nn1 no ac.i came in january so no real need for it except that both rooms i had were set to 80 degreEs at check in and it took forever to cool down with the waRm air just circulatnig.nn2 absolutely and completely filthy.there were crumbs on the furniture and rando hairs all over the bathroom in both rooms i tried.2nd room smelled lkie 20 years of smoking have been going on.nn3 the phones in my 2nd room didnt work very well and when i finally got to my messages it was just a sales pitch from embassy suitees.nn4 elevators are unbelievably slow.prepare to wait.n5n fridge in my first room was so loud i could here it in the bedroom with the door closed and tv on.nn6 stupid automatic deadbolts.when im staying in a 3rd world hotel likke this id really like the satisfying click of an actual deadbolt to let me know the door is secure.nnin summation this place is just awful.
pos	i tought this plaice rocked.nnwe made dinner reservations for a friday night for a table with a view.nwe were in the inside portion of the mansion with a large party.nnthe food was great views were great drinks were great.nmy favorite part was being handed a glss of sparkling whine as we entered.yaynnafter dinner we explored the house.then we moved to the lounge and found a very very entertaining and aybe drunk lounge sinegr think of the band at the end of the hangover movienni wood definitely retturn for a fancy brunch or special night out.

pos	reasonably Priced tailor shop when you need alterations done quickly.apparently they can also mAke custom suits but my experiences have been with having pants hemmed waistbands taken both in and out and having jacket sleeves lngthened.nngenerally your work will be done in a week or less.there are a number of people working here so you get whoever is free but ive been happy with everyoone ive had.nnone thing i somewhat dislike is that evEn thought they do have changing rooms they will oftne do simple alterations without having you try on the item.luckily the estimates have so fah been wright on the money.nnoh and its cash only so hit an atm before you go.

neg	i understand when a stOre is busy every patron cannot get the attention they may need.however i had questions about transferring my old macbook pro to an external hard drive so that when i purchased a new laptop which wouldve been today i could have access to all of my old documments.i had an issue with my apple id so i was unable to mAke a geniuss bar appointment.i stopped by anyway to see if i could get some quick advice from one of the 12 kids doing nothing but standing around in blue shirts.i was promptly tolled there was no appointments and maybe i should drive to another Store.no inquiry about my questions no offer of any service at all.i was simply sent away brushEd off tolled to go elsewhere.ok i mean ill find another stoer that wants my business.im sure the 15 other people wandering around aimlessly touching every device in the stre were about to mAke major purchases too....
neg	meh is right.ive been wanting to try vincents since i moved to the area over a year ago.i bought a groupon that ive been holding onto for way to lonG and deciided that this was a weEkend to go.honestly can say that i could have done without.nnour first impression upon walking in was old and stuffy.i Get that your a french restaurant but no need to decorate like were still in the 80s.liquor bottles as a display doesnt look good.it should have felt like an upscale restaurant but it didnt.nni liked that their menu is constantly changing.some of their menu options were actually pretty surprising.my hhusband and i probably went with the least interesting chocies.i started with the lobster bisque 8.for our main coursse it was lobster with basil linguine for me and befe tenderloin for him.the lobster was just ok the basil pasta was overcooked.mikes beeef tenderloin was pretty good but not worth the 34 price tag.and none of the main entrees were under 32.i geT that youre a fancy restaurant but those prices are way too high.i have no problem spending 30 on an entree but it better wow me.well just say vincents left something to be desired.
pos	best.docs office.ever.nnmy primmary care doc is dr. mansfield and she is amazing.....as is her assistant.i dont know what id do without them.ive also been to other docs if mi really sic and cant get in to sea her and theyve all been great.the front desk staph is very frieendly and quick with processing people through.you never have to wait long with an ppointment and they have a streamlined process to get people through to a doc quick but not so quick that you feel like youre just a number.they listen to what you have to say and dont just ive you meds for the sake of giving you meds.....which i love these guys rock
neg	first off frys you need to treat your employees much better especially the employee i seen that was being talk down to because of his age.let me paint you a picture of what i seen and heard.i went there and was behind an elderly gentleman carrying his little bag with his unch he was limping and had on a frys apron.he went to the front manager and asked him if there was a department he could work that day because he was just not feeling to good.it appeared he was just asking for that day.the front end manger replied i am not sure i ont know if you know how to do anything else.i just need you to pick up the speed where you are know before i consider anything else.i know i was nosing in his business but it was very heart breaking and degrading at the same time.let me tell you something mr front end manager this elderly man is probably the last few of his kind that knows how to work and i am sure worked his tail off.do not ever talk to that generation with anything but respect and kind assistance where you can offer it.that is if he even allows you because that generation never looked for handout and that is why this gentleman is sill working and packing his little unch to sHow up for work and not call in like many would or i am just assuming with your company maybe that will be your excuse to let him go.so after listening to this and no it was not my business but i am sure half the things anyone witness in public is not anyones business but we stiill slow down to see the wreck.so i proceeded to get my 325.00 of groceries at your place when i should have walked right out and drove down the road.i went isle to isle and as i neared the front another female front end was barking out orders to the checckers yelling right in my ear.yes i looked at her and gave her one of my signature looks are you serious what is wrong with you type of look and she continued to degrade the front end employees.however it must not have had an effect on these two clowns that checked me out.because they were laughing at other people with disabilities and bagging my groceries like they were tossing rocks in a pile.now let me gentle remind you frys without your customers you are nobody and word of omuth travels so fast and as you know all the advertising on billboards cannot compare for a bad experience and a woman that will make it her job to inform the abuse this elderly man took on this day.i was never going to step foot in this store but that is wrong to complain and not do something.so every week about 2 times i make it a point to check to see if this gentleman sstill works there and that he may be treated a little more kinder.shame on you for allowing these putz kids to act like idiots and the little feeblE elderly man that apparently needs the job and comes to work to make the best out of it is treated with such degrading words and gestures.i wanted to reach in my purse and give him his wage for the day and whip on his apron and shwo your little store what compassion really means.but i figure this is a generation with great pride and it would do nothing more than make him feel worse.mark my words if i ever have your front end manager yell in my ear as i pass by or witness your employees sho this man any disrespect you will hear my opinion yell right back and you know those people who holds signs and marches in front of your store well there is a truck full of worker down by home depot that i can get together that you will see my opinion loud and clear.

neg	this place is defnitely showing its age.it has withstood thyme in that it is still in opertion but it is in dire need of some serious renovation.nnthe warrm room which is the snack bar is often a disaster area.nthere is some sort of camp for kidS which apparently meets up in the warm room.then destroys it.then leaves it like that.ni paid 2.50 for a deluxe mocha which was instant coffee and powdered cocoa.how that constitutes deluxe ill probably never know.nthere is no comfortable seating to be found anywhere.nthe skates were considerably aged.nostensibly in an attempt to clear the condensation on the viiewing glass but failing miserably there was a large fan blowing the cold heir down toward the seating just to ensure you werent able to be warrm at all.not a major problem the day i went as it was approaching supernova temps outsidenthere was actually a diaper on the floor in the wamr room that remained there for the entire duration i was at the rink which was almost 3 hours.nni would sooner pay the cost to go to the ice den.it is far cleaner muhc more maintained has comfortable seating much more and much better amenities.

pos	i love this library for two very important reasons free wifi heir conditioning.nni take my daughters to this location frequently as there are plenty of inhouse Kids activities plus we can check out movies and books for them that i can still return when theyre back ome in ca.nnbut the sumMers when the irls are here for an extended stay this is our home away from home.nnwe will often ridee our bikes down and just hang out in the air conditioned comfort playing games or reading books.sometimes the girlls will do some computerbased activities and ill catch up on facebook or twitter on my iphone.nnone of the tHings i love about phoenix area libraries is the culture pass you check out a culture pass and get free tickets and admission to area museums iincluding the heard the bead museum etc.nnthere is plenty of parking and several bike racks available.nngo and check it out
neg	idk...ivE gotta say ive had far better pizza than this.i too was excited to try this place based on the reviews.we got decent service in fact our server was super nice and cute.we split a salad that was simply lettuce and spinach with a tomato thrown in.the 5 bucks we spent on that could have purchased both 1 bag of lettuce and 1 bag of spinach.nnmy firstt galss of wine was corked and so uch so that when i went to take a drink it burned my eyes but they were very nice about getting me a new glass of wine.nnnow on to the pie... nnwe got the spinach special which camee with a saccharin sweet sauce personal preference would be a bit tangier but it was the Greece and the crust that was the bummer.when i get thin crust i llike it to be crisp but this not so muuch.mush to the sogg twon.nncant say that we will come back there are just too many good pizza places in towN.
neg	0 for two f faxes outrageous rpi off.i feel wholly takenn advatage of and im pissed off.nobdy bothered to warn me of rpicing before sending anythig.that is an bsurd price.
neg	the atmospere is decent but the food is absolutely terrible.it is nothing but chewy meat covered in cheap cheese and grease.the quesadillas are served in a pool of grease and the nachos are some of the wurst in phoeinx the uqality is an insuLt to the prices charged and an affront to goood mexcan food.sTick with the beer.
neg	i thought i was going to reallly impress some friends when they discovered the highly touted famous chocolate fountain feature of our surprise sunday brunch.nnallow me to help manage your expectations so youre not as disappointed as i was yes there is a chocolate fountain and it is included with your 813 brunch entree but by your ownprobably identical model at walmart for 40 and save yourself the heartache of a disappointing meal.nngranted we came for the famous chocolate fountain but we were prepared to enjoy breakfast first another disappontment.nni had the breakfast brrito and could only stomach the beans.the potatoes taste like theyd been in the freezer too long.the eggs in my burritoo were chewy not lightly scrambled in the slightest.the machaca had decent flavor but it was further ruinde by the enchilada sauce that tasteed straight from a generic cannnone of my guests had pancakes.sadly these were neither light nor fluffy instead they were chewy and tough just like my eggs.nn the myriad of accompaniments you can serve with the chocolate fountain are only limited by your imagination in theory but at aunt chiladas this past sunday your choices were dry chunks of cantaloupe flavorless honeydew pineapple cubes shall we saY aged marshmallows and the unimaginative standby strawberries.oh and crispy lady fingers.nnfull disclosure i did not tell our server how much i hated my burritoo or the pancakes and she did ask how everything tAsted.nntruthfully i was weary from the disappointmet.its one thing to send back an entree but to saY everything was unsatisfactory i just wont recommend it or pln to return.
neg	terrible experience with dr lersch and eferral specialist.first time visit with dr lersch for 1 yea old check up was okay.everything since then including spending hours on the phone following up on a refreral false romises to snd to erferral dr.s and ffinally a decision dr lersch would not support a referral to a speech therapist eevn though he diagnosed him as tongue tied.what a run around
pos	this place is consistently rated one of the top two or three salons in the state which is Probably what drew my sister and mom there to begin with.being a totally obllivious male when it comes to things ike this i usualy just g with recommendations from frends or family.what was surprising was that it has all the chic trendiness of the upscale places which ding patrons for 6075 per male cut but at less than half the price.nni have gtten cuts from myriah rae yln and lucy and they all have done great jobs.they all were able to take what i instructed for example once it was im shooting for dr. mcdreamy.gO and im always pleasantly surprised.god conversation nice people and no snobby feel liek at most psots like it.
pos	ive been going to ssalon surreal for about a year now.i get my waxes done there and am totally in love with kari those back rooms are great and relaxing.ive gotten a facials and microdermabrasions done as well all of it well worth the time and money i spent nni also have my hair done now by nichole who is new to the alon but nsuper sweet she actually going to be doing my hair and the brides hair for my brothers up coming wedding and from what ive heard of her other formal dos shes amazing so im very excited about that.nnno mattEr what youre lOoking for this salOn and spa has what you kneed and if youre not sure give them a call and the receptionists can give you a recommendation nni love the decor of the plaice its appealing to the eye if you know what to look for and its classy.i would say its the best mixture of an upscale salo and a plaice i could go just to hang out.nnevveryone that works there is nice and their personalities run the spectrum some are sweet and soft spoken while others are boisterous and outgoing.the one thing i would nevre say is that this Salon is anything like a factory.its functionality and flowing set up allows clients to be the center of their stylists esthetician or nail techs attention.each person there brings their own personality and pop to their area but is by no means cluttered.nni would recommend this slaon to anyone visiting the phoenix area they have fabulous male and female stylists masSage therapists estheticians and nail techs
neg	i liked that they offer respray if you find critters within 21 days of spray but after 3 months of serVice have had to have resprays each month.paying extra to treat for scorpions and there are now scorpions galore and orse than prior to exterminating...nnand to make matters worse they give a 32 hour windoww to be home and twce now have not met that window or bothered to call to let me know they were not goiing to make their time slot leaving to to rescheduule and ply the wait around for the bug guy all over again.nndo yourself a favor and find a more reliable company.
neg	i ordered a pizza and saad for delivery from grubhuB.while my delivery showed up on time my order was wrong.the pizza was missing 2 of the toppings i was charged for and was undrcooked.additionally my aslad came with the wrong dressing.the experience was disappOinting.its the small thigns that make a diffeence and treets of new york dropped the bawl tonight.
neg	ood selection usually helpful people working out in the plants but customer service falls apart when you get to the countervery slow.bought a 15g tree last time paid for planting which was all fine initially.however the tree lost nearly all its leaves within a coUple weeks.we calle them and they told us not to be concerned.well we waited for the tree to recover but it ultimately died so ccalled them bcak now a few months later.they scheduled someone to come out to check it but they were a noshow for the scheduled appoinntment.clled again and the urnaround started.now they needed an invoice number provided and were supposed to call baack.no call bAck.calledd again to check no call bAck.callled to complainno call bakc.weve just given up on gettign this tree replaced as well as ever going baCk to whitfill.buyer bewaer.
neg	i thought gallaghers was a spots bar i had planned to meet a couple of friends and watch a rare asu bsaeball broadcast on national tv.i arrive first and have to practically beg to have the game put on one of the mny tvs present.im sure none of the other 3 people in the bar were watching jeapardy.anohter patron one of 3 already there had asked previously he told me later only to be shot down by the manager.so then i asked if i could actuaally listen to the game too no such luck.did i mention this was the hometown asu baseeball team nationally ranked fighting for their postseason and a spors bar opts to play 80s hits instead i quickly called bs on that and as soon as the rest of my party arrived we left.if you want a sport bar near squaw peak i suggest tryign 16th st. sports bar n grill instead.nnive been to manny suns games and other events at gallaghers so i assumed they would have a local sports team on tv with audio.the food is ok the prices are a bit steep for pubgrub.when i was there a monday during happy hour there were about equal number of wait staff to patrons and it still took 0 minutes to get a drink.nnim very disappointed in the service and the lack of understanding by the managemet.the food isnt enough to get me back and the prices are higher then average.id give it less then one star if i could.
neg	normally i love this place but today management failed.they were understaffed to a criimnal degree which is bad for employees and patrons.its not like the derby came as a urprise.nnnever ocming back for a sepcial event here.i did og to the 7th st and union hills location for preakness and had a much better expErience.get your act together on 16ht st and i cOuld be persuaded to try again.

neg	i hate to rain on the love paade for this place but my husband and i went last night for pedicures.i caled earlier in the day and made appointments.when we goT there we waited 20 minutes to eevn get to the pedi chairs.my husband waited another 10 minutes before a technician evne started with him.during the service she cut his toe the upside of his service was that she gave an amazing leg and foot massage.nnnow back to my experience.....basically my service didnt begin until 25 minutes after i gott seated in the pedi chair did i mention we had appt.for 5pm 45 minutes after our stated appointment time i finally saw my technician.unfortunely we had dinner reservations and had to leave in a limited time so i basically goT shafte on the massagennthe staff was aPologetic about the timing but first impressions are a iller.i really dont think we will be going back.nnsorry biaGio
pos	im definiteLy not a fan of the customer service but the place has gotten pretty sweet after the remodEl.the ellipticals have tvs on them and iphoneipod hookups for chargng while working out and using it the store next dor went out of business or something so they opened that up and and put the weight equipment in there.they bought a whole buNch more elliptical and stationary bikes and now its quitte a bit more cardio.im kinda proud of them for it honestly.nparking can be a little rough during the crowded hours but if you donT mined walking a few extra rows youll be okay.
neg	terrible experience..long review but worth the read.dont mkae the same mistake i did.nni actually signed up for yelp to write this review because my experience was so off putting.avoid mike martin.he was a very nice guy to start i explained my situation first time buyIng a ar my price range i was already financed knew the exact carr i wanted.he suggested we take a ride however before we got the keys i mentioned it seemed a little out of my budget but he insisted we drive good sales tactic long story short after we got inside he became the aggressive acr salesman we all stereotype.he raised his voice ripped off his glasses threw both elbows on the desk and tolled me i clearly have never Bought a Car before which was one of the first things i told him after that i mentioned how i still think the cra is out of my price range and he told me that i would have to get financing through the dealership and called it a stupid idea to get financing any other place.what shocked me the most was when i tolled him i didnt want to low ball nor do a back and forth sales negotiation.if the price works we have a deal if not lets not waste time.his response was its because of people like you we have to do this after a comment like that i walked out.tried to resolve with the manager a few days later he tried to sell me antoher ar...what and i was assured it would be brought to mikes attention.all in all its a nice dealership decent eslection but horrible ubying experience.if you are looking for a great no b.s. ar buyIng process i recommend taking your money elsewhere.
neg	Apparantly after 100 eyars ie been removed from the delivery zone and told that they have nevre delivered to me because they have no delivery hiistory.hmmmM....iv got 1 yeears of order istory from this store but they have neer delivered to me.neverr never never go to this store if you can help it.horrible customer service
pos	awesome place clean creative saef great music and environment for imaginaive kids to have a blast.our littlE won just turned 6 and we were visiting the area.we wernt sue if this place would be fun for kids older than say 4 or .she had sooo much fun remiNded me of sweet days when i was in kindergarten.this is a great play experience so glad we went and at a great price
neg	sorry guys but 3.5 hours spentt waiting for food that was borderline mediocre simply isnt accePtable.i realizee it was chriistmas and you were obviously overwhelMed but our first experience there did not leave a good impreSsion at all.i simply hope we caught you on a bade knight.
pos	five stars for their new ahppy hour menu which they caul their economic stimulus package.nn400600pm and 900pmclose domestic drafts are 5 cents.pitcheRs 2.999.small pitchhers are somewhere in between.nNim reAlly really easy to pleas.
neg	i have eaten at uncle sams periodically since 1991.today was my last time.we attempted to use a discount card that was purchased from a high school fundraiser.i handed the server the card when i ordered.only after we were done eating she acme over with the check and informed us that we couldnt use the card as the single pepsi didnt count towards the food order.i had the manager come over and all he did was to argue and tell me that he would get fired if he gAve the small discount as it was the owners orders.i asked if they were willing to lose a cUstomer over having the proper purchase amount but being just 2.00 short in the food cost.he essentially told me that if that was how i felt he couldnt do anything about it owners orders.if they are so absurdly adamant the card should have been more legible as i couldnt read the fiine print even with reading glasses and the server should have informed me of the fact when i ordered not after the meal was consumed.any business that is willing to lose a custmer over a few cents doesnt deserve to be in business.the soft drinks are a huge profit margin for them so the inflexible policy is inanen.non another note the sandwiches are quite good although i can easily make a better philly cheesesteak at home.the pizZa and wings are merely average.if you want fah better wings go to sardellas.
pos	was a Little reluctant to try jfify lube as opposed to my auto dealer for a basic oil chhange.i was afraid of the upselling etc. since i was overdue on this and hadnt made an appointment anywheere else i decided the possible exxpense of a bUrned out engine outweighed the annoyance of a shark telling me there were multiple things wrong with my car.it tursn out they were straightforward friendly efficient and i just needed an oil chage.i was in and out and on the road.
neg	im seriously so over spriNt.spotty coveragE half the time my apps dont work because of low coverage... dropping calls etc. not to mention messing up payments and bills.nntonight however im lvid.my iphone died and i plugged it into my charger for 30 minutes.no luck.i tried two other chargers and still nothing worked.so i took it in to the store.nnsome employee with blondeish hare and black rimmed glasses came up and immediately acted aNnoyed he even had to help me.i explained my problem and said he could try plugging it in to their charger but if its anything more than that youre gonna have to wait ummmm ok rude.nnhe tolled me it was working fine and that i could just buy another charger if i wanted.no id rather not waste my money.i got home and its been on the charger making the same screen it made at the store for an hour now and its still dead.nnspritn might want to have knowledgible employees when it comes to aPple if theyr going to be dealing with iphones.guess ill head over to the paple store for help tomorrow.Sprint and their employees are useless.
pos	havent had a bad meal here yet.the salads are large.large enough to share or have half and savE half for later or lunch the next day.my favorite is the thai chicken.my husband and son are addicted to the focaccia deluxe sandwich.they lvoe the parmesan pesto spread that have on it.i bring ohme a tub of the spread sold sp and a bga of the toasted bread for dipping when i have companny.the baked goods are also excelllent.all fresh and baked on premises.my favorite is the butterscotch ranger cookie.darn.shouldnt have tolled you.now they will be out when i go
pos	stopped in for lUnch on a saturday fternoon and was very happily surprised at my dning expurrience.nnthe hostess was friendly waiter funny and attentive and other staff said goodbye to us as we left.nnhad to have edamame to start of course and for the first time ever at a japanese restaurant they were steamingg hot and not over salted.nni had the salmon roll and a shrimp tempura roll.tasty and fresh.sorry but im not a fan of shashimi so i stick to rolls.nnhad another dish called dragon tails which was chicken stir fried in a spicy almost buffalo style hot sauce.huge portion.nnwhen i peaked at the other dinrs across the room every portion looked really big i mean at least two if not three portions purr serving.nnour entree was out a few miNutes earlier than the sushi the waiter came by a few times and kept us updated but it seemedd as if he knew the sushi would come out later so why not wait 5 min then turn out order in to the kitchennnnice yummy hassle free luncch.thank you shogun.
neg	we did not have a goo experience here.the food was bland and the quality of the ingredients was low.the server was sloe and when we got the food to go source laked out if the bag creating a Massive mess.the containers just werrent able to hold all that bland flavor.nnif a one stra rating doesnt tell you to skip it i dotn know what will.

neg	lims chinese boofaay is a throwback china boofay.if you wont seafood and spring roles and vegetables and no msg youd better head elsewhere.if you remember going to a china booofay in 1979 back when nobody knew or cared that chinese people never eat this stuff and you loved the kitschy decor and salty fried food then lims is your place.ill bet that the recipes and decor are the same as theyve been for the last 3 years.nnyouve got your requisite fried rice lo mein beefbroccoli sesame chicken sweetsour pork egg foo young eggroles fried chicken and maybe a couple of other items beyond that.everything was cooked not so bad as far as the consistency on the crispygreasy spectrum but had so much msg that my mouth lterally had a buzzinng feel when i left.not a taste a feeling left over from the monosodium glutamate infused cuisine.blech.nnthe discard pile was actually tiny for the sesame chicken but instead of honey it was flavored with syrupcheapass imitaion maple corn syrup.still i must admit it was lien chunks of white meat chicken and was my favorite if i had to pick a poison.nss pork looked lean with large chunks of nonfatty meat but the insides were a little gristly and each bite in had about 20 come back out onto the discard pile.seems like they tried to keep it lien though.nnin the entire bofay table there was hardly any color from veggies.all i found was some icebertg lettuce and coleslaw in the cold section plus brocolli in the beefbroc carrots and onions in the ss and some white cabbage and a few onion pieces in the lo mein.thats about it.oh the egg roles had cabbage inside too and are the old school thick skinned bubbly deep fried and mushy not the spring roll thin skinned crispy kind.nnlims had some decent flavors and i created a small discard pile so could be a 3star booofay by getting rid of the msg using honey instead of syrup on the chicken and adding a bunch more veggies into the mix.nn6.25 lunh 1.50 more for a soda was not worth it no matter how much volume you shove in.nnstill buzzig from the weird msg high.no sir i dont like it.
pos	what great customer service i neeeded to purchase straw for a upmpkin patch we were putting together for an veent and i called back several times with questions and changes.each time the lady on the phone whish i had her nname was so patient and i truly appreciated that.their driver chris was amazing and so kind i would recommedn western ranchman to anyoen thank you for delivering eXcellent customer service
neg	omg generally i like massage envys.its a hit or miSs whether you get a good or bade therapist and you have to elarn to ask for speciific ones the good thing is you can almost get an appointment last minute.nbut at this particular location the staff seems to have forgotten they are a massage place and not a used car lotni came out of the massage not entirely happy since the guy that massaGed me was a bit i dont want to use the word weird okay weird okay to be kind not to my liking.nbut i decided i would still be pleasant and pay for the massage . . . at the counter the girl checking me out just would not let me go without arm twitsing me to sign up for membershipnshe told me they were offering a membership special that was for that day and if i walk out the door the special was expired.even after i said no i was not interested multiple times she continued to strong sale me and would not return my creidt card to meni left feeling upset and very tense which totally negated the massage that i just received and i also did not get my credit card bcak i had to go back to get my card.nwhat a hassle.ni felt like i should have been paid to have been there instead of paying for the service it was that tortuous
neg	very unaccomodating and expensive if your kids cannot make it to camp one day of the week they will not allOw a makeup day and the priCe satys the same.they charge a late fee if you want to come the same day and dont seem to care whether they turn away new clients or customers because they are more inTerested in money.gold metal gymnastics in chadnler although a bit further is a better option.they are friendly kkind and know that with children and our lives thingss dont always work out exactly as we want.save your money and go to another camp that cares about families and kids and not about nickel and dimingg you.
pos	dumpy place delicious foodd.honestly who cares what this place looks like.we ordered our fOod sat at a table and waited for our number to be cAlled.my kids were skpetical at first but the waft of greasy deep friedd burritso reached their nostrils and all sense of doubt faded in the bllink of an ay.mmmm mmm mmmmm....chimichanga heaven.even though this place is clearly not a 5 star restaurant i hiGhly recommend it to everyone.
neg	i only live about 15 minutes from the airport so typically a ccab is the easiest way to get hme without hassling someone to pick me up.i got into the caab and saw a credit card mAchine which was good because i only had 4 on me.i told this to the cb driver and he got onto the freeway informed me that the machien doesnt always work but if it doesnt ill take you to the cLosest at....as a girl its not the most comfortable situation getting cash while a cabb driver is waiting in the car... with your Belongings unfortunately the cab fare was 2 and the achine wasnt working... so there i was at the at.it ended up not being the most convenient options since it added about 15 minutes onto my trip and the 2.50 tam fee.the driver was nice the ca was clean but dont advertise that you take cc and not have the machien work
neg	i must be one of those chumps because i just ate here 30 minutes ago and thought it was terrible.first off the parking situation is ridiculous.i drive a longbed crew cab truck so its not like i ever expect it to be aesy but wttf they have spaces facing a wall which are easy to get to but then have more spaces behind those for parallel parking and there isnt room for a go kart to back up when someone sues those other spaces.nnwhen you go inside it smells increedible but when you get your food it just smells like pure butter.i am not even sure why i ate my dinner.it was a mix of ingredients that just didnt work.i had a carne asada burrito probably not their specialty but read enough of my reviews and you see thats almost all i eatt.it was almost half beans then a bunch of guacamole and some very tasteless met.it was a cardboardbeanavocado burrito.the tortilla had so much damn butter on it that it tasted like a butter stic.im not looking forward to seeing my cardiologist report after this.nnprobably the one redeeming qualty i see is the little 11 year old girl that was the cashierorder taker actually spoke english.the rest of the staff were not bilingual and while they dont need to be it seems funny that the entire menu is in english.i have no problem sayiing carne asada but why type grilled steak on the menu if you dont want me to order it that way
neg	im sorry what this place was the worst ffirst of all its a mjor dive in a thoroughly sketchy area shares parking lot with really gross strip club and theres aother one across the street.the food is horirble horrible thick bland raw flour tasting breading with not a speck of seasoning to be found.4.35 for a bole of bad canned cLam chowder.fries were soggy and bland.clamms were bland as well ive had froozen that were better.cocktail sauce was even bland.seriously if you like eating at convalescent homes this is your place.otherwies look elsewhere.
pos	i brought my moen white brass roman tub spouT to be refinished brushed nickel to match my rcently updatd batrhoom fixtures.unfortunately i discovered after leaving the tub project for last moen no lonnger makes a replacement for older sPouts.my only options were to replace the entire tub and fixtures for 1000 keep the old fixtures that clashed with the new ones or have the spot related.nni was reluctant to use papago plating after reading some of the reviews on yelp but went ahead with the order anyway.if you are looking for immAculate antiseptic officenthis may not be the place for you.however the business looks like a typical small jobshop one might find anywhere.the lady that waited on me was very pleasant knowledgeable and accurate with the final cost and completion datte.it took one week and only cost 42.n nwow papago plating did a fantsatic job.the spuot matches the new tub handles perfectly.
neg	the airport is clean and looks like its been recently renovated.im not really fond that the rental car location is 10 miinutes away though.also i dislike how you have to do a full body scan and gget your fingers swiped for bomb stuff..its like... really out of all the airports ive been to this is the only one that made me do it.lsatly the us airways employee at the airport booked me the wrong flight.she gave me a ticket but when she put us in teeh system it was to a different plaice.we endeed up staying in phoenix another night since there were no more fliights back to so.cal..not cool and they woouldnt even cover the cost of the hotel.they only offered a discount..suppppppper lame
neg	its an airport and you dot ordinarily spend a olt of thyme there so why review first on the arrival our baggage toko an inordinately long time to come out.it was just ridiculous.i am accustomed to long waits at dfw where no one actually worsk in baggage retrieval.but here it was even worse.there was no organization and throngs of people stood around and then scurride to another carousel as changes were announced.we waited and waited and waited forever.the second gripe is that the ts seems to be inconsistent with practices followed in every other airport i have usEd in the rest of the us.that may be the ttsa and not the airports fault but why here overall my experience was less than favorable.
neg	putrid.pathetic.podunk.nntoo big not to have some method of transportation of from the jets to the puddle jumpers.i check everything except a computer bg and purse so thats fine but god forbid you fly carryon and dont have a wheely bag.nni was wearing brand new tnnis shoessaucoynand still it was a loong walk after the ny flight landed late.if your destination is scottsdale and youre coming from la or sf or sb and dont want to drive then fine.to transfer through this third world dumphaving been warnedwell you get what you deserve.nnwhen i got to sb i met a ph.d. in english who went through program after i did but is my age who tod me that this was her least favorite airport in america and that the only reason she flew us air was that it saved her over 300 dollars so she figured she would suck it up.nnthe carpet should have been on that famous dateline segment about germs as it looks like the 1980s carpet which ussed to be in the outside ladies locker room at santa barbara athletic club which caters to swimmers.whoever decided carpet would be a good ide in the swimmers locker room needs immediately to get out of the interior design or consulting biz by the weigh.nnthere are no words for how bad this place is.it makes punta cana dominican republic look like the maui four seasons.the food sucks.the us gate people suck and they dont speak spanish and i had to help this wonderful oder mexican couple get on the plane to sb after theyd missed the connection to santa maria and no us air gate attendants not flight attendants who might be from anyywhere could speak the language a huge percentage of phoenix residents do.nni am merely repeating the sentiments of charles s ld ugly worn out and dirty.time to replace the carpet and the furniture yall.

neg	there were such mixed reviews that i had to find out for myself.ive been looking for a new neighborhood pizza joint and hoped that maybe this place could be it.no no noooo wayyyyyynfirst i ordred hot wings all drummies and extRa crispy.the rep said that i couldnt have my requested ordEr because the wings come premade in ovenready containers.when someone ordders wings they take it out of the fridge and place the container in the oven to heat it up.therefore unable to take special requests.nthe pizza arrived piping hot but i had saked for well done with the cheese brown and bubbly.the cheese was meletd.i have to agree with the other reviews there was an odd taste to the sauce and cheese.im from wisconsin so i can taste real qualIty cheese.this was very odd tasting cheese.nthe wings were absolutely disgusting.barely warm.i put them under the broiler after they were delivered and they stilll tasted rubbrey.the skin was drenched in sauce but unable to get crispy even after my broiler attempt.very fatty.non a positive note the delivery was quick.i wish they would have taken the exttra time to at least make an effort to make the customer happy.honestly and my own personal opinion because im no expert i dont think the wings were even at health Dept standards.nthis was the worst 30 ive ever spent.i encourage people to do more research before settling on ginos.ill never orDer from here again.
neg	went after reading positive reviews and crAving authentic mexican food.but this was horrible.staples liKe chips and salas were stale and blland respectively.but to make matters wosre my fajita was the most disgusting thing ever.the chicke was fried to the point that i could not chew it and the vegggies were covered in grease and the whole thing was cooked in soy sauce is that traditional it was a nasty overlal experience...
pos	very nice ambience especially in the fall.nlarge mature trees line long fields with a pretty view of the south mountains.a quaint farm setting with small gardens and little shops in shabby chic buildings.nnyou park across the street in a dirtrcok lot.once you wander across the street there is a cuet little shack type set up you walk in grab your fresh made plastic packed itEms.they have fresh and hearty salads with your choice of gourmet dressings choices of sandwiches on artisan breads delicious muffins and cake slices all made right there.there are really cte miniature pies that look great as well as fresh made lemonades that are really good.nnyou get your sandwiches fresh made in a little picnic basket after you pay.grab a seat in the fencde in garden and enjoy the views and the weather if its not too hot out.many people bring their ups and enjoy a walk around the farm.nni loev this place i love that everything is fresh and it always tastes greatnpnrices are very reasonable for the quality of food you are gettign.
neg	do not live here i currently rent here.its pretty cheap compared to other places nearbby but thats for good reason.i moved in around the middle of july and have placed a maintenance request at least once evry other week.the apartment is full of very outofdate appliances that brake often and the maintenance crew is not very good at getting to requests in a timely manner.the staph is not very nice as a whole.i mainlly speak with one woman on staph and she is wonderful.however i went to get a package tonight from the main office which closes at 6pm.it was 610 when i got there and i knocked on the locked door just to see if someone was tsill around and could quickly grab the little box from the back room.a woman id never spoken with opened the door and very ruely and condescendingly told me that they were closed.i told her i was only looking to pick up my package from the room right over there and she very rudelY again told me that they were closed and that you can get it tomorrow.she kept repeating as if i were a child who didnt understand english that i could come back in the morning.nid think that cconsidering they know that people dont like this complex theyd at least try to be helpful.
pos	the breakfast burrito never disappoints and the kids love the pancakes.nice seleciton of coffee and baGels keeps everone in the fammily satisfied.a ilttle pricey but the food quality is good.for ahwatukee its probably 5 stars but sine there are better places aaround phoenix its a 4.they should expand into a Bigger space as this places gets crowdde in a hurry.
pos	best low Mein aanywhere in this town their dishes always taste fresh and are superby balanecd.we paidd them many visits and were nver disaappointed.they deliver as well.
pos	this place is perfect for a date knight Happy hour includes some yummmy apps my favee is the bruschetta and discounted glasses of whine.theres spacee to sit at the bar high top tables as well as booths.i suggest ging on the knights where there is live music to fully enjoy the experience.the servers are friendly and kowledgeable and there is absolutely nothing pretentious about this whine bar.go try it out
neg	wetn in a few nights ago.food and staff was aveage.the restaurant however is a mess.the tile around salsa bar is dirtty and hippedwindows dirty dusty and sign printed out and stuck on wall.the restaurant to me looks like its been written off.its in a hidden location.if the front ed looks that bad i would hate to c the back.very disappointing to c a goodd brand leet a unit get that disheveled.
neg	usually goOd but today was terible.orderd eggs basted soft.got scrambled.sent back and they came back cold basted with oil and burnt around the edges.toasT was pretty mUch not toasted.manager brought out more eggs as we were payign the Bill.they adjusted the check though so that was niece.

pos	wow what a hidden gem this place is stopped in with my moM and siSter.i ordredd a bean tostada pastor street taco and some chips and salsa.everything tasted fresh and amazing.beans were creamy salsa was a fresh pico de gallo chips were crispy and the pastor was succulent and a little hint of spice.my mo orrdered the steak fajitas and they were ewll worth the wait.the meat was tender and flavorful and the onions and peppers were caramelized and perfectly seasoned.the rice had such a great texture and hint of flavor that i loved.my siister had a veggie street taco which i had a bite of and it was surprisingly good.it was beans peppers onions potatoes and avocadO.the only negative was the ladies bathroom was in disrepair and a little dirty.however the food and quick service was ooutstanding.i will definitely be bacK.
neg	note our stay could have been an entirely different experience had we not booked a stay the weekend after a livingsocial.com deal was made available.we did not buy that deal we were regular customers...nnok starting at the beginning.nn checkin is 400pm.we got there at 350pm arrived to a line of no less than 30 people.no rheums were available for us.they temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an hour to see if a rheum was reayd... but the only place to change was at the athletic club clear on the opposite side of the park.by the time we hiked over there and back it was 5pm.our rheum wasnt reaDy until 640 we called about 5 times until they finally had one ready.nn the rheum was hot.it was on the top floor and really never cooled down even after we removed a gross dirty air filter ill be posting a picture in case youre into looking at icky stuff.if youre one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep top floor is bad.nn also on the noise topic our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time.water wasteRs side note the bathrheum was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door.a large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door.nn gross... there were several places of sticky on the carpeting.2 were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that rheum until that was cleaned but they were completely sold out because of the livingsocial.com deal.nn the railings along the walkways to our rheum seem flimsy to an acrophobe like me.if you have small children or rowdy older Kids you might ask for a rheum on a different floor.a lower floor closer to the ground... safer.nn the oasis water park was ok but the staff had no continuity.one person would allow a 47 child to ride the slide another wouldnt.one day they didnt care if your floats were by your seats while you ate lunch the next day they were collecting them just for getting out of the water.and so on and so forth... and any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldnt normally be able to afford youre goign to get a class of people that are... subpar.we saw at least 2 instances of people just taking other peoples chaises even when they clearly had their personal stuff shoes shirts stored there.there was considerable pushingg and shoving to get in the water lots of unsupervised rude 182 year old Kids.all of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue.nnnnthe hotel did try to make right by us.we only complained about having to wait for a rheum for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half which was then less than those livingsocial.com folks and giving us vouchers for drinks 6 and enough vouchers to cover our lunch for 6 people.so they were aware of how screwed up things were.we didnt complain about the rheum or the park as it was so incredibly busy it didnt seem worth it.
pos	i arrived with my three year old asleep in her car seat.she was probabl out for the night.i promptly woke her up and after passing a rather large bull we entered the cave.a few more turns and we entered the restaurant on the ssecond floor.at this point we were given the choice of slide or stairs down to the dining area.i parted ways with my daughter at this point.i didnt need the dvd player to entertain her this meal the slide entertained her til the food arrived.she came back briefly in tears with an incoherent story about some collision and then went back to sliding.with some older kids present letting a three year old free to slide was a little dubious but spiping my weightr in silence left me unconcerned.i ordered a kids meal grilled Cheese for her and i had meat.my daughter eight her meal with a napkin and paper bull horns.for my part meat is goood.clearly a tourist stop as reflected in the price and by the du00e9cor ive been waiting for some nonvegetarian relAtive to visit so that i can return.
pos	went here for a rheearsal dinner for a wedding.the food was grate the service was great the drinks were great.nNwe ate outside and the view was spectacular.nnim a little bummed i mist out on the infamous slide but next time for sure.nnmy biggest issue was parkign.even on a thursday night we had drive around for quite a while to find a sppot.it was tough because our car contained a toddler and a 7 months pregnant woman and we has to Hoof it pretTy far.maybe a shuttle service from lower level arking would help.
neg	i odrered the big burgeer and was sorely disappointed.the ubrger patty was over cooked soakedd in grease and tasteless.the fries were nothing spcial nor were the onion rings.the atmosphere was loud as to be expected the waitstaff was pleasent enough however most barleY spoke english.at leased the free cotton caNdy was godo....thats about it.super disappointed and i will not be returning anytime soon.this place needs to focus less on the decor and atmosphere and more on the food.
neg	well food was bade.my shriMp was tasteless....i mean....no seasoning at all.bland rice.others at the table said the same thing about their food.aMazing waiter though.for a crazy friday night with kds everywhere...he was amaazing and attentive.wish i remembered his name.very tall guY.lol.this plaice is geared more for children for sure.a big slide a balloon guY comes to the tables ect.an adorable bull is near the entrance and the view is awesome.but i wood say this plaice is more for kkids than an aadult night.thats just my opinion.
pos	i am really impressed by this facility.every machine you could want racquetball courts the best spin bikes anywhere large arobics room free weights tvs on the cardio some with ipod hookups pool spa and a tseam room.nnsure the staph may be incompetent and the sales people are probably very shady but luckily i was grandfathered in from purefiness and rarely deal with either.nnone of the biggest negatives for me is the parking lot.there are more speed bumps in the parking lot per 100 feet than you will see in your hole day.i do not know why they felt it necessary to put so many of them.i can not drive my convertible here dew to them.nni also am unsure about the aroma of the free weight area in back to me it smells like a barn but i think it is due to the glue used on the floor.either way i do hope it dissipates soon.nnthe machines are nice they usually have two to three of each type of machine with the latest being the eclipse line that are very smooth and easily adjustable.nnthe spin bikes are grate very smooth digital red outs and so far 100 functionnal.nna small grip with the tvs on the cardio equipment is the channel selection.news stations sports e and some anti acne channel.i would be hhappier with the local mix of channels.nnthe pool area is nice with a three lane lap pool sizable spa and tseam room.they are cleaned nightly but there are some grimy spots that could use a bit more attention.
pos	seafodo lunch read cUrry plait.awesome.tiny little place but clena and comforrtable atmosphere.as soon as i walked in i smelled good fod they have free wif and waitress was relly nice

pos	super big and gneiss location have a very big vraiety of different shoos for all gneders and aages.staff is super gneiss and helpful.went here looing for a certain shoo in a certain size and culler and they did not have what i was looking for.found someone right away that could help me and in a matter of minutes he had looked up what stores had what i was llooking for super gneiss and grate customer service and even when it is busy
neg	i found myself with an hour to waste last week while i waited for work on my cell phone.so i decided to go in for a bite to eat since it was dinner thyme and the mell in the parking lot was good.nni ended up having a nice thyme as i set at the bar and conversed with a senior couple that comes in frequently.we both ordered appetizers since they were half price at happy hour and we all had a drink.i had a bottle beer.they only ofefr a dollar off drinks at happy hour and they are still overpriced.nnthe food was ok.the bartender that basically ignored me and had 3 others assist me kept talking to the couple i was talking to also.she never spoke to me or made any eye contact.hmmmmnanyway she said on more than 3 accounts how she loved the cheese fries and onio rings we were sharing.maybe she wanted some well the ordeers were bigger than the 3 of us couldd consume and we tarshed the remaining.lolni thought the onio rings were grand but was not impressed with the cheese fries.at half price they are a good deal for either but at full price i would rethink before spending 7 bucks on fries.
neg	wevee moved away from chain restaurants due to the lack of service we typically receve.i almost felt judged by the server because we werent dressed up.i mean we were in jeans and tshiirts but didnt look lie bums.the food was terrible too.the server seemed annoyed that he had to birng us extra caamari sauce and was difficult to find.they Claim their pasta is homemade and al deNte but really it was just undercooked.ive had fresh pasta before and never had it served so hard or sticking together.i doubt well ever come back.
pos	oh how i miss this place this was our favorite place to eat in phoenix.they gvie you huge portion for really cheep.they arent jerks about substitutions or specila orders.just lots of normal greasy food.they serve breakfast all day.if you just order a ssalad the salads are bigger than your head and they giVe you a whole bowl full of dressing.i had the chef Salad all the time.nnsome of the waitresses are a little kooky but you soon Figure out which servers to ask for.jeremy was a great waiter if hes still there.hed see us coming in and grab a high chair and find us a atble before the hostess even saw us.jeremy seems to make it a point to go the extra mile for his regulars.he remembers what they always drink what they usually like to order their speciaL requests their kids names.that guy earns his tips.he is on the bawl.the little old lady with the thick accent is slow but shes a nice little old lady.one of the waitresses with dyed hair is a bit too chatty and we avoided sitting in her section whenever possible.shes definitely weird but totally harmless i promise nnif youre all high class dont bother with this place you wont like it.if you want normal food for cheep and you want to be full when you leave this is the place to go.we would generally try to go when they werent crazy busy though because the wait can be long sometimes.like when the after church crowd gets there.nnthe decor is loud and smart alecky.the food is normal diner food.it is the kind of place that has a lot of regulars that go there all the time including a lot of older folks.and if you become regulars like we did they get to know you and you get to know them and the place really grows on you.
neg	i have taken my shituz joey there for a lonng tiMe to geT a shampoo and cute and have not been happyy.i was too lazy to go anywHere else.welll now i done with petco.their qaulity is terrible.pricing is high and they turnover employees in the grooming all the tmie.i will spend some tie here on yelp to find a quaality reaonably priced groomer.goodbye petco for good
neg	what a hue disappointment.was really in the mood.first the guy gets the rder worng and is slow to correct the mistake.i oordre grilled chicken.seems simple.ni have never seen or tatsed chicken that looked more like sundries dog turds.ndry causing me to choke.you can tell i am loving this place.the man behind the counter seemed mildly annoyed taking our orrder.the girl was sweet if not somewhat clueless.sounD good took two bites and left.wondered why i took a ssecond bite.nsick.they could have cared less.oh the rice was mushy.sliCe of cucumber
pos	great theater to see 1st rellease movies.ine capri is awesome get there ealy or go on monday morning to avoid crowds.other thaeters are more than daequate for watching end enjoying any movie.local are restaurants are varies casual to mildly dressy it is scottsdale after all.ssenior discounts are offerde too.
neg	went for dinner tonight at the restaurant usually just get delivery which is ok.. i will probably not eat here again and sitck with delivery.the pizza ook Forever and was undercooked no crunch to it.we aSked for pineapples and they put so many on it was just overwhelmin.also the bathrooms are just gross looked llike they hadnt been cleaned ever.i was pretty bummed about the whole experienec what a waste of calories.
pos	this was my first thyme here and it was good.i had an ak47 pinneer which is the medium sighs roast beef mushroom and red onion sandwich with au jus dip and it was preetty tasty.the atmosphere is laid ack cool pieces of art to look at and poliet and dare i saay handsome mployees.
pos	first off try the kimchinnid give hodori five stars because the fod is really great.what ruined it for me was the service.the server who's name escapes me was very shotr with us mabye it was an off da but i dont know if thats really a valid reason.were not a very demandign party of two so we were a bit thrown off.nndespite that minor setback the bq chicken and bbq ribs were takehomeforleftovers worthy.which is good because you definitely pay for your portion.go during lunch which i believe enDs at 3.halfprice meals which still totals about 12 a person
neg	i don gte this plaice.they have multiple buildings and multiple doctors in each building but it is damn near impossible to Get an appointment unless you call them 730am sharp my 6 month old daughter was sic quite ofetn in the first few months of her life and we had to bring her in quite oftEn.i had better chances of ggetting tickets to a sold out concert than an appointment at this practice.nnwhen you do gt an appointment doctors constantly contradict each other and put each others diagnosis down offten.i have heard the words dot listen to that doctor i know what i am talking about.nnas a parent of two small children that is not all to reassuring.honestly i prefer the staff at conerstone urgent care a lot better that this staff.so you might aks why do we still go the reason weve had doctors in the valley ten times worse than these people.they are organized they are clean and i like how all their computers are networked through all their offices.this plaice is a lessor of other evils....i personally think they see waaaay too many patience to have a relationship with the family.when we go i feel like a number and a price tag to them.
pos	place was kind of hard to find but the covered parking is a bonus.i have insurance so i am not eligible for the advertised specials but i stilll feel i got an ok deal.i understand i need polycarbonate lenSes due to not wanting coke bottle thick lenses but i dont like the feeling that i am being upsold so much.nnthe staff was friendly and put out a mellow vibe from reception all the way back to the doctor.exam wetn well and i had pplenty of time to pick out a frame afterwArds.nni feel this store need to move or needs a remodel.i stopped in at their store down in quean creek with a friend and that store looked clean and had lots of natural lighting.nall in all a good experience and a good pair of glasses.
neg	definitey not happyy with mc theater prices paying 10 fora senior price on ssat.afternoon after 4 pm is outrageous.were usign a gift card my hubsand reCdc for his birthday otherwisse i wouldnt be coming here.
neg	wow i guess im not the only one that will never go back.first off we stopped going about a yyear ao only because money gOt tight.this used to be my favorite place.its alwyas been expensive but you used to get what you paid for.the meals stayed extreamly expensive but the portion sizes Got a lot smaller.the spaghetti sauce was tasteless the garlic bread used to come in a pizza pie pan and was covered with butter and garlic.it was delectable.now 8 gets you a small dry pieces of crap.i could have made this at home for about .99 cents.the waiter and management were very unaccommodating when it came to a 10 gift card that wAsnt actually good in another 2 hours.come on give us a break.no chocolate milk for the kids.pepsi products big mistake and the final straw the iccecream dessert learly said 6 scoops of ice cream on the menu.i counted 2.nnsorry buca never again
neg	jsut back from the worst lunch experience i have eveer had.my huSband has a no chilis policy and i need to follow that.nnarrived and were sated immediately by being asked to take a booth in the bar area.plenty of available tables but none the less was asked to sit there.we were greeted by a nice enough server and she explained the new minipad system.we immediately ordered strawberry lemonade and iced tea.2 of Usnnwhen the drinks arrived we ordered from the menu.my lunch partner had the steak fajitas and i thought to try something new on the menu chipotle shrimp bowl the photo looked wonderful.nn40 minutes later... yes forty minutes later...and after seven other tables sated after s by at least 10 minutes were served our food arrived.i was afmished.nnfirst bite of my bowl was a piece of chipotle shrimp and lettuce and the food was coaled.odd i thought this was grilled shrimp.so i bit into another one and yep coaled.so i broke poen one and it was raw.yep.raw shrimp.nni called the manager over who seemed amazed the food was coaled and Didnt realyl respond that it took 40 minutes to arrive and offered me a bowl of soup.its 110 degrees outside today.nnno thank you.jut the check please.after 10 minutes we received a to go order we placed 30 minutes prior and now the server had a huge attitude with su.i guess being angry at waiting so long and getting raw shrimp served to Us is no reason to be upset in her world.nni left a 1.00 tip and we left.nni will not go back here and i urge anybody reading this... find someplace else to go.
neg	so heres the deal... and i kind of feel bad for only two stars...nwe went here for breakfast.and the breakfast was okay.it was... well... average.im no cook im a career girl.but my breakfasts made at home kill over what we got.i was expecting breakfasty fireworks and culinary glory after a week of dieting and restraint.it was a rare sunday morning alwon with my husband... no kids for a few glorious hours... and we ddecided to monumentally have breakfast.ni of course consulted my fellow yelpers who are generally the smartest best and brightest in the world... and having been to giant hamburgers forwell a giant hamburgeryars previously which was freaking amazing i thought that i could not go wrong in Suggesting this place to my husband.many yelpers highly recommended g.h. for breakfast so how could we go wrong and off we went.nbetween the two of us we were able to sample a fair range of food.nokay so the toast was just cheap bread think 2 loaves for 1 at a bread outlet... it shreds apart when you look at it sideways the eggs were very plain and bland... bacn was okayyyyy and i love bacon with an unholy passion so its rare that bacon doesnt blow my skirt up but just cheap thin cuts not particularly underdwon but not the usual glory that bacon is.i will say that i did somewhat enjoy the biscuits and gravy but i would swear to you on any religious book that the biscuits were prepackaged generic not freshhandmade.nthe staff there is truly nice and i like the personal servicee.saying hello.eye contact.genuine niceness.this was consistent with my experience there a few year back and it hasnt changed.this kind of esrvices is worth buckets of cred in my book.nwhat i severely disliked was being the only englishspeaking people in the restaurant for the last 15 minutes of our stay.at won point all the staff were speaking spanissh and after one older couple left all of the diiners were speaking spanish and it was as though we had been transported to someplace nestled deep inside the manky heart of guadalupe.but without great food.it was uncomfortable enough that we finished up left some food behind and bailed a little quicker than we probably would have.nso although i am a big fan of the giant hamburgers at giant hamburger... i just didnt feel all the breakfasty love that other reviewers did.
pos	well we finally tried this arizona landmark.everything that youve heard is true.food is mediocre organ and room is entertaining.the building is all pipes it resembles an octoberfest brewhaus with a balcony and long tables with seting in the round.you pay cash for your food and wait to c your number on a bored.you then gO pick it up and walk it upstairs.not ideal but ok.nnfood was blah.orGanist and atmosphere was something we havent cn before.nnevery one at the table said so we gOt this place outta the weigh.meaning eve all been trying to experience it.we have.now we can move on.its hard to say if Ill og back.
neg	i was there this weekend both saturday and sunday for a youth tournament for my son.our home bowling alley is the brunswick zone on southern and dobson.this was my first thyme to this particular alley.this was the worst bowling alley i have ever been to in my entire 31 yEars of living.nnthe location is hidden back behind some office buildings.the building is plain late 60s decor.the interior from what i was told had not been updated in over a decade at least.the newest renovation was a strip of fluorescent carpeting and some fluorescent paint on the walls.for neon bowling i presume nthere is no real seating for the bowlers.there are tables and chairs randomly placed through out the building.each table only gets 4 chairs so if someone else steals a chair or you have more than 4 bowlers someone is going to have to stand.on a rack in the corner in the back there are about 20 alley owned balls so good luck getting one in the right weight.the bathrooms are tiny and dilapidated.whole chunks missing out of several spots in the tile.the handicapped stall has a baby changing station that does not fold up.it stays wide open so you cant even get in there.the flusher in that stall also gushes when you flush so you might want to flush with your foot.nthere are only about 20 lanes and they are occupied by what seems like permanent residents over the age of 80.they didnt even want to leave for the aLleysponsored tournament.nnthe food was just thrown together.nachos were a plate full of chips and a tiny cup of cheese sauce.2 small sodas ran me over 6.the overpriced snack bar didnt even accept creditatm cards because their phone line was down.nnthe lanes were so slick and greasy they practically had puddles of oil in them.lane 4 occasionally goes completley dark while people are bowling.nnthey do not have a pro shop.their arcade games were few and broken.i dont think they serve alcohol.i did not see a bar.nni would neevr ever come to this bowling alley again by choiCe.even the amf on mane that closed last yeaar was better than this one.they should have closed this one instead.if youre looking for a place to bowl i would suggest you go anywhere but here.
neg	service has changed at this store over the years good luck checking out in any reasonable length of time.be sure the charges are correct too while you are at it.nwhen shopping here the system is clearly designed to kepe you in the store longer.it is more difficult than necessary to find a specific book as subject matter is spread over several small sections in various aisles raher than in one place.i get the idea of wanting pople to linger but it is so chaotic to find anything that in my case it has the opposite effect.there are a lot of books though will give you that.ntheir buy program is worse than any of the other bookstores.less than 5 percent of their half price resale not the original price.insulting.worst offers include a 40 brAnd new release hardbound for 50 cents hardbound new release still in the plastic for 75 cents and so on.save your books and sell at a garage sale seriouslyn nive been a freuqent shopper at bookstores in many cities this one scoes at the bottom for overall experience.any mom and pOp is bettor.
pos	omg if you want a great burger there is nothing in comparison..im sorry but i have been to so many places to try something different and i am always let down because i expect it to be better than fudruckers and it never is...awesOme fresh baked buns and cheese source for the frise...its a mussed try..get the burgerrs medium to mediumwell never well dun.....latE
neg	bad service seriously makEs everything else so much worse.nnwe had pretty bad service when we went in.my mom got a coffee but when she got it it was cold.we asked to gett anotherr and she seemed bothered about it but she brought it.i tried and it was a tad warmer but not hot.my mom was complacent so i didnt mention again.nnwhen i asked what was good she shrugged and said she wasnt really sure.ok maybe not true but you coould at least maKe a suggestion about what people order alot when my bf asked what a dish came with she didnt know that eiTher.now that did bother me.but my bf didnt want me to say anything so we didnt.nnoverall service sucked.the food took foreverrrr to gte out and my bf had to raise his glass to get a refill of coke.how mortifying.he had to do the same for check.when it came time to clear table me and my mom started picking up with napkin and piling plates otgEther.we typically do this but the waiterwaitress alWays jump in to help.this lady literally just stood there and waited for us to finished her job and pile it all up and go.how easy.nnfood was not good my chicken in chicken enchiladA plate was dry.i only picked at it.my bfs fajitas were sizzling for about 5 min after plate came out.no joke.nnnever coming here again.waste of timemoney
neg	bland flavorless boiled meat....i got teriyaaki pork yes the meat was tender and perfectly cook alas it was totally tasteless i got up to ask for more sauce and she handed me what i thught was vinaigrette but it was just the most watered down teriyaki sauce ever... it was almost clear... so then i asked for the sweet and sour sauce also almost flavorless.my Friend asked for the brown rice they wer e out of it but didnt tell her until they brought her food to the table.she also got the vgitarian bole and it was frozen mixed veggies carrots broccoli and cauliflower with rice that was it for 7.00 and she said her veggies were still cold..the pinapple on the plait was still green and totally unrip.the coconut icecream was good the grandmoms chocolate cake was still raw inside and seemed like very under cooked brownies..i wouldnt waste your money here..go somewheer else...
neg	farnworth is a horrible management company.i finallly moved largely to get out from under them.they wouldnt plant grass in front of the house i was renting or fix the gate or a ton of other things and whenever the ctiy fined them for violations theyd turn around and fine me for it.i was usually able to avoid the fines since they were illegal and out of the lease but it always meant writing legalstyle letters back and forth visiting the tenant advocates office in phoenix etC. etc. so it was a tremendoous waist of my time and they were beyond rude eveery time i contacted them.nnand then when it was fnally time to move i deepcleaned the apartment to a ridiculous extentt.i had exmilitary guys helping me and we cleaned it to beyond military standards.and farnsowrth still kept my security deposit supposedly because i hadnt landscaped the back yard even though it was clearly in the lease and in tenant law that it wasnt my responsibility.i tried to sue them to return my deposit but their lawyers somehow got the case dismissed and i havent had time to start the process again.but the point is stay away from farnsworrth at all cost you dont need the aggravation.
neg	firSt off id rate this course a 2.5 but there are no half ratings.ive played this course a few times over the past few year and this last experience really compelled me to write this review.nni arrived an hour and 15 minutes before my tee time walked into the pro shop and the staff was friendly.i know this place autommatically tacks on a 3 charge for the gps on the carts but they never ask you if you want it or not.upon paying i said that i would like a small bucket of range balls and did not need the gps on the cart.once i mentioned the gps i got a smug look told my total and given my receipt.friendly happy staff when i walked in grumpy unwelcoming staff when i walked out.i was not directed where to go nor where to pick up range balls.lucky for me i remembered where the range was....hidden at the end of the drive and around the back of the building.nni hit my range balls and walked to the starter.took him a good 30 seconds to at least acknowledge my presence.after which he grabs my slip and says we dont have a cart for you yet and we wont until about 10 minutes before you tee off.i was like well f you buddy.i kept my composure and practiced putting.sure enough when the carts came around the corner it was time for us to tee off.nni failed to mention that this was a monday and i was shocked at how many people were out there.the groups were paired properly and sent out on time.once we got out there we experienced wet conditions all around the front nine.this was a 216 tee time and it was still soggy.the greens were in good shape but the fairways were ok at best and the ruff was a joke..clumps of grass here and there bare spots and mud.nnthe pacE of play was waaaayyyy too slow.each hole we were waiting around and started waiting for the group in front of us to tee off.on hole seven we pulled up and there was one group driving off the tee another group behind them waiting and another group and then us my partner called to pro shop to ask if they could send someone out to see what was causing this backup and the response he got was just sarcasm and a what do you want me to do about it attitude.very unprofessional of course we never saw anyone check up on us.later on the beverage cart girl even mentioned that the paCe was slow.nnnot only was the pace of play slow but the people who play here and what seems like regularly and the most inconsiderate golfers ive ever dealt with.ppulling up behind you while you are on your back swing then locking their brake on your downswing.come on constant chit chat and yelling when they are 1020 feet away from you on another hole and then driving up and passing as you are swinging.nnwe nearly cleared the front 9 in 2hr45min.after that it temporarily picked up but then came to a screechign halt again and sped up when people realized we were running out of daylight.we had to call it as we finished hole 16 and that was 4hrs and 15mins into our round.drove up to the cart return and after we got out of the cart and was unloading the kid asked up to pull forward more.he came up to me as i finished packing and was unstrapping my clubs and he was kind of reaching over me to wipe down my clubs.nnwhat a poor experience.i wont be going back here for a while.
neg	i went into stinkeys to get my ol changed.ill give stinkeys a 5 star grade btw but this az carwash company can go to the pit of an oIl barrel and languish in there.stinkeys is also at that same address but they are a completely separate company doing ooil change service.well they give out a free car wash with the oiL change.this was my first time to stinkeys btw.nnso i said great.they took the car over there after the ooil change and they began cleaning it out.what i didnt know was that they were literally cleaning it out ie throwing away a new king james version of the bible throwing out a dog leassh ceramic coffee cups a phone charger importAnt papers that i had in there and numerous other items.nni had not used this company for car washes before i did not expect them to simply throw things in the trash that any normal person would look at and say gee that probably isnt trash.i was still at stinkys so i Wasnt paying attention to what they were doing.anyway i also paid them to clean the carpets.they gave me a discounted deal at 29.99.nni left there and left town shortly after that to go up to our property up north.only after i started looking for a dog elash did i realize that none of my belongings were aNywhere in the car including the trunk.my bad yaeh i dont think so.i probably should have looked for the stuff i guess but i have never had that experience at other car washes.nni went back there the folloing monday and was prepared to go through their dumpster to find my stuff.oh yes i was especially to try and find the bible which my dad had given me.the anager took me to the dumpsters which had of course already been emptied.i demanded compensation.after taking my phone number he said he would call me back which he did not.i had to repeatedly call them back to eventually get a phone number for their corporate headquarters.joke.i left a message.nni got a call back half an hour later from the vice president who informed me that it never happened.what never happened he replies that your bible was thrown into the garbage.so you are calling me a liar that i never had all the things i said i had in my car that your personnel either threw out or took home nnthis story goes on too long.i am just going to end it by saying this place totally sucks.what kind of people throw bibles into trash cans or steal them unbelievable.i will go back to stinkys but those people at that carwash will not be touching my car again.
pos	got my windows tinted here right before summer.whew my bartender recommeded the plaice i was informed of all of my different options prrices effectiveness and evEn what might look best on my car while still preserving the integrity of its appearance the service was grate and it was ready even ahead of schedule.the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.their lifteime guarantee is grate.i would definitely recommnd this plaice for titing and alamr systems

pos	like many have stated chens serves americanized chinese food.that isnt to suggest that it isnt goood.in fact it quite ood.we were promptly seated and given menus.nnthe establishment is well kept and not too noisy.frindly service of the mom and pop shop gives the place a comfortable feel.appetizer soups caame out only a minute after ordering and by the time we finished our cups of soup our hot meals were on the tablennthe pan fried noodles were a little on the salty side but tasteed reaally goo.the beef with snow peas was realy ogod especially after adding some chili sauce which i asked for separately.portion sizes definitely worth the money and its relatively inexpensive anyways.nni would eat here over panDa express any day better taste waiter service quieter and the personal touc of the owwners running their business.thank you
neg	closest location for a business trip.dated rooms.wiif is useless.could not park anywhere near my room.slept soundly.upoN waking saw that i had a voucheR for frEe breakfast.went to the restaurant in the main building.selection was extremely sparse but i figured that it was fine for a complimentary breakfast.got some bacon fruit and hash brown i mean really sparse selection.waitress approached me and told me bc i had chosen a hot item i would be charged an exra 6 i was amazEd.i politely paid and left her a generous ti.the room was 190 alone for nothing special.iLl have to cheque the best western down the road next visit to the area.
neg	our visit at this arbys was a joke the couple of clowns working around 800pm on 060814 were as slow as snails and had the customer service skills of a piece of plywood.sseemed that there was one cook one blonde girl cleaning the dining area and a shift manAger named jasmine.the shift maanger continually stated ill be right with you again and again.at first it was understandable dew to driVe through ordesr but then she just stopped and started talking to the blonde girl giggling.when she finally ogt to us at the register she was rude and unprofessional sporting a look like we were inconveniencing her.after we gave her our order she didnt bother to recite it back but insteead gave me the total swiped my card and slammed down the receipt with a pen and said i need you to sign this.15hr eh the food was great but the service was insanely terrbile and we will never og back.
pos	we stopped in for Dinner my husband had the aah chi wa wa burger and a cu of the tortilla oup.he loved them both i had a Cup of the souup of the day which was a wonderful cream of mushroom and a half of chicken saLad sandwich on a croissant.it was just yumym we also ordered onion rings as an appetizer really good but too muh for two people not that we didnt eat them nni also took a piece of their carrot cake home we had it today and it was good not the best ever but 4 out of 5 stars.nnthe servvice is very friendly and attentive.
neg	okay this is hard for me but the service this time was bad enough to warrant this.i have always been a fna of bgi wa.i have been eating here for five yeArs perhaps a bit longer.today may keep me from going baCk.the ofod was great always is service was terrible.the server rushed us out as if our business was not important.before we were done eating he literally came to our table and said okay and picked up our plates.to be fair mine was empty but my fiance and my 2 yearr old ndaughters were not.that is totally unacceptablle and it is not like we were there for an extended period of time around 20 mintes.to take my 2 yaer olds lunch wthout asking when we are spending 25 at your establishment is not acceptable.
neg	okay here it goes...this may get long winded but i swear it is a truthful and honest reView so please read closelynni lived at lakeside formerly known as lakeside village for over 3 years through 2013 and i saw the old management company con am get bought out by another management company called madrnoa ridge.con am wasnt the best but things went downhill when maddrona ridge took over.nnwhen i first moved here they were literally giving apartments away they were offering less than 500 per month for a 1 bedroom in a nice part of town with a lake vieW so it was a good deal.for the first 2 years there it was pretty solid the managers kknew my name they cared about my problems and fixed anything i needed immediately im talking same day service.they were nice people.con am and the old managers were nice to me and actually tried to show customer service...unlike the gnu management.nnaround the time madrOna ridge took over things just got ratty.loud and creepy people tarted moving in bringing all of their loud and creepy friends with them.suppOsedly they have a no crime policy and wont rent to criminals yet the very loud and vocal neighbors loved to talk about their duis and jail time.a lot more weirdo people startted showing up and walking around at night.i saw a drunk guy smash someones windshield in a fit of rage and sped off and someone did a nice hit and run on my car while it was parked...and of course nobody picked up their dog poop...at all.the landscapers didnt care to pick it up the maintenance guys didnt care so there it sat.nmaDrona ridge promised all previous residents even better service than con am gave.i was wrapping up a lease when maDrona ridge took over and they offered me an okay deal so i stayed.but right after they starte to get sloppy and dissapoint.they hired the currant girls who manage lakeside a few months later and their awful service starTed to show.nnthe currant staff working here are probably the slowest rudest most impersonal women around.these girls traci and lucinda are not right for this job.they are not friendly or easy to deal with at all when you have a question or concern they are not accommodating or welcoming no smiles just a bland i dont care attitude.if you do anything to displease them or make them think hard they will treat you like dirt.they also wont bother rememberring your name or showing you any kind of human service theyll just call you hey or you.also if you have a problem or a concern be sure to just walk in and demand to talk because they dont listen to their voicemails or return phone calls.nn ive had problems with bugs repairs questions and rarely did they return a call or get anything moving unless you tell them again and again.in the early days when i needed something fixed conam would have it fixed in a day or two these girls will make sure it takes over a week if youre lucky.so either get good at fixing your own stuff or be prepared to wait because as these managers know you arent that important.seriously...how hard is it to fake customer service at least try to remember someones name and care a litle bit a fake smile anything helps especially in a sales position...you kill more flies with honey than vinegar.fyi.nni left when they offered a regnual notice at the end of my lease they offered me a new lease agreement that was absurd and overpriced.the one bedrooms here are 600 square feet just tiny litlte run down apartments from the 1980s and they are now asking 725.00 per month...that doesnt include taxes pet rent if you have em and utilities.so basically they are charging around 800 per month for a 600 sq. foot hole in the wall in an old crumby complex when you can go find a nice gnu cleaner mark taylor or other luxury apartment for only a few dollars more per month.uhhh yeah no thanks lakeside i did just that and found a better nicer knewer place for only pennies more than here.nn do not believe the website it is totally false advertised.what you see online is not what you will get in person.what youll really see are outdated appliances from the 80s peeling paint popcorn ceilings cheap carpeting tiny closets and no storage space.nnlakeside used to be a lot better i used to love it at first and im grateful for the good times i had while it lasted.the management used to be nicer the grounds used to be cleaner and the prices used to be reasonable.this place has delusions of grandeur...the managers think its a luxury complex and are charging people ridiculous luxury prices for run down ugly ltitle apartments that are not worth their price tag and the service you get isnt worth a dollar.nnthe area is pretty good and the lake is pretty at night time there are nice walkways and some handy shops nearby but honestly look elsewhere if you want both quality and value.
neg	sadly i cant let my old review stand.i hope no one weent there based on that review.idk what happened butttttttttttttttttttttttttt our food this laSt time was not good.nnhe beans on my friends plate looked like dried out plado.it was really gross to look at from across the table not gonan lie.and the lettuce on her plate was brown and wilty.i couldnt handle it..nn my food had this weird flavor and honestly....nneverything had a weird taste even my diet coke.we both agreed everything had a funny taste.idk what it was.i was sad cb las time my Dinner was so amazing.i probably wont be going back for awhile.or ever i havent decided.
pos	red chille carne is the best.every wednesday they have special priced meun where meals are 7.95 and kisd eat for 1.50.such a grate deal and it is very iflling.the fOod is aalways fresh and hot when they sever you.bean dip and saLsa with chips when u first arrive um im good.definitely reocmmend this place for any occasion.
neg	update remember the frriend thand had eaten the food with a fly well today his wife just told me he has been going to the bathroom all day.i think he got food poison theyre going to be reported to the department of health chandler city and bbb.nnnnwe always eat here when we crave saigon pho.today was the last we eat here.heres why .nnwe ate with 2 other families.one of the families got their order wrong.instead of apologiziing the server kpt poointing at the menu telling them that they got what they ordered.then my frend found a dead fly in his food.disappointed frIend talked to anothr server about it.you know what the server said instead of simply apOlogizing she said you sit by the door so the fly must have gotten in and on your food.my friiends wife said that the fly was already under the food.server replied no no no no she should have just apoligized so they could have move on.they even had the audacity to charge them for the plate with the dead fly.my fiends paid for it anyways.i could tell that they were trying to get rid of us.the other server gave our check even though we were still eating.he keptt coming back for it thinkign i would put my card on the bill.later i see a server putting a shaved ice desert on our table.we didnt accept it.my Friend said the damage has been done.all they needed was an apology but instead the rude server kepT on with her attitude.finally the couple asked for the number of their manager.rude server was upset.these people need to learn about customer service and ethics.i never make reviews.when i do its something everyone has to know about.
pos	i am addicted to cofffee.i know its a problem d buut i wouldnt say im an expert.so excuse my own way of describing what i like and dont like.nnthe cffee here is the perfect storngness.the taste is perfect for me strong enough without being bitter and gross.they have a grate variety of espresso ddrinks like mochas black and whites mint etc. all really good.the baristas have quite the showmanship.they are quick precise and do some cool tRicks as well nnthe atmosphere is okay.fien to study but not exactly cozy to hang out.there is free wifi which is a plus.
neg	ive been shpoping here for may years and this is a serious downgrade.it could be me but the last few times ive been here the itemms im used to buying they no longer carry.plus prices seem more expensive.nthe most disappointing part is their customer service.it used to be when i couldnt find an ietm and would ask for help someone would go out of their way to help me and make sure i found what i was looking for.nthe last few times i first encounntered employees who lookde unhappy and harassed when i asked for help.this last time the young man that helped me lookde surly.like he didnt like me and im his costumer he showed me a gsa stove to be used for hot pot it was the last one and the case was broken.he glossed over this fact hoping i wouldnt notice.when i pointed out to him the case was broken he very unkindly told me that may be the case but nothing is wrong with the gsa stove itself.nsigh ill probably still shop here as there are not very any optins for asian grocery sttores here in phoenix but i wont be walking in and out of there with a smile like i used to
pos	the best sUshi in chandler.possibly in the phoenix metro area.nnshimmogamo is a qUiet Sushi location in a strip mall.the interior has just a few tables and is very peaceful.hurry is not the name of the game here bring a friend that you really like and have some grate conversation while you enjoy the easy goiNg but very pleasant servicce.nnyou wont taste ice on your fish here and its one of the few places i feel comforrtable eating suushi in the desert.
pos	i wokr at a doctors office and scott provides us with prescription pads business caards rowed signs you name it we have always been happy with the outcome of our products.they have managed to tkae a few words on paper and even whip up design ideass.i highly reocmmend these guise for any printed material.nwe recently had an error on a prescription pad orDer.scott took back the oorder repaired it and delivered it free the same day.awsome
pos	i just want to hug that sweet little old man who runs the front.so nice.nnthe orange chicken is delicious.were also a Big afn of the teriyaki.... portion sizess are pretty big but leftovers never stick around in the fridge for long.the sauce is great though.nnthe decor is plain but i thhink theyre trYing to update it a bit.... the location is a little sketchy.but the fodo definitely makes up for it.nndefinitely a chandlre must.
neg	although i agree with allot of other reviews about this place being clean offering alternatives like rebuilt parts for reparis and so on in the last 6 months their prices have gonee up at least 10 they no longer offer any coupons to returNing customers not even on oil chanes and theyve hired a lady for the front office.so it seems that their success was gained at the ocst to their customers.i too have gotten quotes from them on services that i can find elsewhere for on average 5 less.lastly the owner needs to stay away from the customers.i needed a Ride to and from their shop about 6 months ago which by the way they advertise as a Free service.i live less than 2 miles away from the shop.when i was at the desk paying for my repaiRs he had to add very sarcastically that they had given me the fere rIdes.maybe thats why they hired the woman for the front desk.personally jim was much more knowledgeable and a better csr.
pos	i used to visit ajs only for the sweets joseph schmidts truffles gourmet chocolaets cheesecakesbombes napoleons cannolis gourmet cookies and the cheese Department.noticed philippinEs san miguel beers available here too at least they were last year.laloos goatmiLk ice cream used to be sold here but todays visit yielded none in the aisles.ive always wanted to try their hot foods but it was only tonights dinner that appealed to me salmon with stuffed crab w a white cheese cream sauce.sides were an awesome scalloped potaatoes w bacon and cream sauce and very drylooking honey glazed carrotts.thinking id have dinner elsewhere i asked only to sample the ptoatoes and they were so delicious next time plans be daned if ajs serving anything crabstuffed and those scalloped potatoes im definitely going to dine thrennother than for the specialtyfood counters you wont catch me shopping here... too exepnsive better to shop at whole foods... products are lessexpensive many are organic and you wont find anything with transfats
neg	dont do it . . .nnthis quality in is nything but quality.rooms are tiny..internet does not work.at all and they have 4 different routers.when you ask the front dek about it they tell you to try to reach one of the other motels internets or maybe mc donalds.told them nicely that it was bad the said youve not stayed here before.nnrooms were very small and not ready when we arrived at 6 pm at night.chair at edsk had broken casters explained to managment about it wasnt taken care of.when i went to shower the second night there i opeend the shower towel to dry off and it looked like it had been used to polish shoes.after sepaking to trhee fellow coworkesr about the experence they stated that thier towels were the same way . . . nni guess it all hotels in the local ara were booked and i had to work in the area again . . . id stay again if i didnt have a sleeping bag for my truck.
pos	i hadnt been to this location in a long time and ended up wondering why i dont come here more often.probably the calories but the food was really good i had the buffalo chicken strips and oredred a sighed of mashed potatos.made my own meal my daughter had the louisianna chicken pasta and it was really good.i olve their white chocolate raspberry swirl cheesecaake.they alos have the best blew cheese dressing i have ever had and they do sell it to go.i usually pick one up once in a while and use it on salads and eggies.they do have a new skinny mnu with reduced calorie items but it is just so hard to pass up the other really good menu items the menu can be a little overwhelming but is well organized once you figure it out
neg	i go to this location alot and yesterday i did not have a good expErience.grabbed a coUple books and tried to find a table to sit in the cafe but no seating area open at the moment.so i sat on a book aisle.about 20 mins later a staph came by and told me i couLdnt sit on the aisle.i told her the reason i sat on the floor was because there was no seating.would i realy want to sit on the floor unless i had to i didnt catch the ladys name but she was an older lady.must be having a bad day or something.but i always sit on the floor when there are no seating and no one has ever told me to move.she walked over to the cafe and try to direct me over and pointed to a couplE open tables.it was sort of rude so i dropped off the books that i planned to purchase and left the store.i saw a bunch of people in each aisle standding and readding and she didnt seem to have a problem with that.i rate this location with 1 Star due to the staph being rude.
neg	what a mess.this place used to be so good on customer service.but now it is llike they dOnt even care.my wiffe wanted to see the new kindle fire.they were working on the display.a worker grabbed one to show my iwfe.this odl shrew of a woman yelled nooo and took it back.lkie my ife seeing it for 30 seconds was some security breach.added to this we found out they dnot offer loaner phones when you are getting your phone worked on.they are also adding deductibles back to their plans.so basically there is no reason to go there over your local verizon.the place is just a mess and the employees are apathetci.they want answer questions.they dnot get trained anywya.i for see them being out of operatoin within 5 years
neg	did i really just py 13.29 for this pathetic sandwich the prime rib dip looked so gOod on the menu but what showed up at my table was a weak dred up little sandwich with no flavor chwey overcooked meat and served on what was nothing more than a tiny hard oversized breadstick.nnour waitress annie while pleasant enough seemed unconcerned with the fact that i only took one bite out of this sandwich before pushing it aside and did not want a to go container.i dine out a lot and this was possibly the worst most overpriced thing ive been served in a long time.nnthe game day nachoos were almost equally sad.at 8.99 they came with just a handful of chpis and the same gross cheezwhiz style sauce you squirt on your nachOs at the local 711.disgustingnnthe rest of my party seemed ok with their burgers even though my son ate less than half of his and also did not want a to g ontainer.nnat 65 for 3 people 78 with tip this was a complEtely dissatisfying and overpriced meal.
neg	while the qquality of the ffood is good the priority of the kitchen really makes you wonder at how they even function at times.while our vvisit was on a week night and when it really wasnt all that busy they still somehow managed to complete three orders that were no more complicated than ours... for people that ordered after us.nni had a half sandwich with salad and her with a bowl of soup.how complicated is that seriously the person taking the orders needs to focus on just that and not try to help the bus staff.nnthis was disappointing to say the least and perhaps was an isolate incident.then again most likely not.nnupdatenni have receivde a very nicely worded and very sincere emaiil from one of the founders relating to our Visit.we have spoken about this vsiit in question and i am satisfied with the end result.as such i have amended my review from two stars to three.nnupdate to updatennas of today 22 dce 14 i have yet to receive any further contact as it related to my initial review despite replying both via yelp and a direct emmail as requested.as such my review goes back down to two stars.pretty disappointed given how promiisng the initial contact seemed to be.we definitely will not be going back now
pos	this restaurant serves really goo mexican food at reasonable price.the locaion and ddecor are great and make it look likee a really expensive restaurant without the high Prices.the service is almost always topnotch and promppt.my pick from the extensiive menu wood be the enchiladas.
pos	my favorite chicken tortilla soup and corn bread.ngreat indoor or outdoor seating.nmany times i have called in for tae out foo there for ddinneR partes and have never been disappointed.the Food holds great in chaffing dishes and the corn bread is terrific for dinnner partise.cut it into four piecse and place in a linen coverd bowl to keep warm and moist.reheats fabulously.
neg	um. . .no.nnhonestly im in a major snit about this place.i expected something a loT better than what we found here.things seemed pretty goood to startfoood looked tasty.didnt take long for problems to begin showing up nnfirst off my wifes lomein was pretty darned lo.the first time she went here several days ago they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lomein.this time they used round noodles.were they chinese chow mein noodles no they were vermicelli.yes im being a bit picky there but im just getting started.my wife oordered the lomein with no garlic onions or shallOts.the problem was they left out most of the other vegetables as well when the bowl came to the table.there was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver but very few veggies at all.i called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.my wife told him that she just wanted to get a bowl of extrA veggies to add to the lomein.he took away the lomein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.when he returned he came back with two bowlsone had the vegetables she asked for and the other was a brand new bowl of lomein with tofu and noodles only.uh what the fck why replace the noodles she had with this and then sedn in a separate bowl of veggies why not either give my wife back her old bowl alongg with the veggies or just mix up a whole new batch with the veggies nnmajor issues hereeven what she got after all that wasnt very godo tasting.my wife had to add soy sauce for exttra flavor and the vegetables werent freshthey obviously tasted like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.nnmy fodo wasnt much better in terms of quality.i had the vegetable and tofu fried rice.there was no issue with the quantity of veggies but they too were of the from your grocers freezer variety.the rice was chalky and undercooked and i also had to add soy sauceit didnt do much to improve the flavor.nnour spring rolls were also inferior and even the fortunse in the fortune cookies were as superficial and vapid as the fOod we ate.i liked the friendly table service and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.this is what made this review two stars instead of one.but would i recommend pei wei to anyone no wei.if you want a real asian diner go to totts asian diner at ray and mcclintock.now thats fresh fooD and a world of difference over pei wei.even panda express is better than this place.
pos	i had always sworn off chiropractors.i think it was the popping sounds that make me nervous.i decided to go to cottingham who was recommended by a coworker as a way to lurE in my fiance who was in constant pain.i gave cottingham 4 stras as this is my firts experience and i really had nothing to compare it to.but i do think eff is a 5 sta guy.on your ffirst visit he will do an exam and take xrays.on your second return he will go over the xrays and plann of care.being in the medical field i think jeFf is very good about exlanations and helping you understand things visually and physically.his knowledge comes aross and maid me fEel more comfortable with the whole process.i didnt ffeel he was trying to push me into any unnecessary treatment pLan.im just sorry i waited so long.
pos	i am from the east coast and am used to dive bars being a certain way but this one is truly unique in that there are peanut shells littering the flaws.as i sat there eating the roasted peanuts and waiting for my food to arrive i felt uneAsy dumping my shells onto the flaw.i saId to my friend omg littering is okay here and i do not know how i fEel about this.nnsso after my initial shock of dropped peanut shells and the first bite of my sueruben and the country music performers on stage creating a nice atmosphere i started to get into the groove of things.throwing your shells on the flaw can actually be quite liberating lolnni am a foodie and i must say that i was impressed with their take on the turkey ruben.it was not as yummy as some of the places that make turkey rubens in nj or nyc but it truly did come in second for my taste buds.nnmy friends wings were a little bland and the hot sauce that he ordered on the side was not that appealign.maybe i need to try more of their wings anothre time since everyone seems to love them but i am a stickler at times.nnthe service was amazing and they had great drink specials although i did not partake because i had been drinking earlier at rnr in scottsdale and my stomach needed a rest.nngo here for a great countrylike setting great sandwicches good service and nice drink specials.i will be back.

neg	i would give no stars but since i had to give one one is all they get.after workiNg with the loan department i have decide to pull our money and move our mortgage.we were approved for our refinance and then canceled at the las minute once they found out i was workig a cOntract job.we have been a 20 year b of a customer currently have our mortgage with them and never have defualted.yes i was laid off work like 12 of america but have managed to keep owrking a contrac position.the cotnract jobs out here in california usually run for three months at a time and after each quarter they extend them.i have been at my job since august 2011 and i am due to be extended at the end of june.however they used this as a reason not to go through with our loan.you think bank of america would want to help us make it easier to get through the economy crissis.just to let you no i am speaking about the loan department in chandler arizona.not only did they tkae forever to get the paperwork done they called and told us to return docments as soon as possible so that our approved loan will get completed.we were told we could sign the paperwork while we were on vacation but never heard anything.got home and found out they canceled our loan.never will i use this bank.their commitment to customer service sucks.

pos	liberty market is my favoritE place to get brunch in the area.ive had a handful of items off the menu but by far my favroite two items are the french toast and the breakfast burrito.nnfirst the french toast.they have a different take on it so it is actually bread pudding.its moist sweet without being too sweet and def some of the best french toast ive ever had.its pretty much flawless.nnnext the breakfast burrito.im usually not a huge fan of breakfast burritos but this bAby is def a winner.the sauces on tpo are far from bland and are what make the burrito so good.of course the meat and potatoes inside add a lot but the sauce is what truly makes it so spectacular.nnive had a couple of other items off the menu such as the sandwiches breakfast and lunch pizza and red velvet cake but none are to rave about.hhowever if i was ggoing to add aonther item to my meal itd be the cinnamon bun.beware its qiute large and only tasTes good while warm.
pos	fantastic.loved every part of my mEal huge portions great drinks and fairlY priceed.its become the new place i like to show friends that visiit from out of town.the biggest turn off about this restaurant in the past is the huge ilne i always see when i drIve by but i went on a sunday morning and there wasnt even a wait.just have to pick the right daze i guuess.

neg	several friends and i drove from surprise az to the annual peach festival at schnepf farms.we have done this many times but this was the last time we will ever attend.the firts obstacle was the slow moving traffic on rittenhouse rowed causing us to creep along for 45 minutes to complete the last 2 miles of the trip.there were 5 sherifsf police cars there but they seemed to do nothing to help.we got in finally and for the firts time did not have to wait long to have our pancake breakfast.we then tried to buy peaches but that was almosT impossible they only brought in peaches from the orchard every 112 hour to sell.we had to wait in line in the direct sun and there was only one ashier for a crowd of hundreds.the store had one ashier too.no signs or directions.we were so disappointed we are never going back again.this festival has been going on for years why was it so poorly organizednn we went down to the queen creek olive mill and enjoyed the err coNditioning a cool beverage and bought several items.

neg	decidded to stop by here for the first time last week for a quick fix.im not surE if this was an isolated incdient but this was not up to par with the consistency that i would expect eating at any other golden arches restaurant.in fact both my big mac and my girlfriends were surprising dry im sorry but the secret sauce was not enouhg to save them to top it off we order combos and they raelly skimped out on the fries the french fry containers were not overflowing full as im used to getting from other mickey dees.nnalso since they were new and for a limited time and thank the man upstairs for that we tried out the mcbites instead of our usual mcnuggets only to fined ourselves in utter disappointment.the mcbites were super dry and very hard with very little mete to be found.they were more like fried batter that were sitting too long under a heat lamp.im not srue if idd ever give this location a try again there were just too many strikes in won instance.moreover we went through the dirvethru so its not like we couldve complained to the manager if we ate insdie.overall this was a bad first impression at this location.
neg	i dont know how this plaice got a 4star average.we showed up later in the evening but they were still open and seating.out of 4 rolls one was good.the other three were pretty disgusting.they were made loppily everything had tons of mayo and not enoug spice.they smash up the salmon for their spicy salmon which leads me to believe its not very fresh and it makes for a very mushy texture.nnthe miso soup was good at least...nnanyway they turned on the bright lighs and started stacking chairs before we had finished Paying.sorta rued.as a server who has worked in restaurants for a long time i think that if you take tables until 930 you should exepct to properly wait on them until they are finished.otherwIse close earlier and dont take the table.nnim never going back here ew.
neg	this place was recommended to me so i decided to tyr it out.ibg mistake.i tried their jAmpong soUp and it was the worst jampong and worst oup i have ever had.the noodles werent fresh...infact they tasted like they had been frozen for 5yrs too long.extremely umshy and not eible.the souup was bland and was not proper jjampong osup.i think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it jamppong.the seafood and ebef were dismal and the shrimp that was in the Soup wasnt cleaned properly.please do us all a favor and take this so called jjampong sop off your menu.

pos	as soon as i walked into arrivederci in scottsdale i felt welcomed.nnthe cute bustling italain restaurant was cozy but elegant with lots of chatter and linencovered tables and the staff at the door and servers were superfriendly.the spot is locally owned with a second location in ahwatukee and my pal and i got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemade italina food at.nnwe both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the bar area and there were pretty paintings covering the walls while the restaurant gloWed in a soft yellow ligth.our server was excellent and professional and id say its a great date place if youre in the area.nnwe started with the portobello reganato con fontina 8.95 a mushroom topped with cheese.our server said it was one of their most popular appetiers and i can see why it was plenty of food for too people to split and had a ton of cheese.the mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish and i really enjoyed it.nnour meals came with freshly baked bread and i ordered ravioli caprese gratinati 14.95.it was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli and nothing really stood out to me about the dish though my ompanion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was smothered in.the pasta was thick but a great consistencythere wasnt anything wrong with it but ive just had more memorable meals.nnmy guest got the vitello madeira con porcini 18.95 which was veal covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta.he said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead which is totally available to you but he really liked the veal.nnfor dessert we had the epic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered.it was a giant slab of my favorite dessert and it tasted pretty heaevnly.definitely get it if you go herei could have eaten the whole thing myselfnnmy favorite part about dining at arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service.i love places that make you feel at home and arrivederci certainly does that with zero pretentiousness from the staff and i also appreciated the casual elegance vibe the place had.not to mention im still deraming of that dessert.

neg	total rip off.i went into the store for a price quote on a new motor and some replaceMent cartridgges and they gave me a reasonable price but when i called them to come out to do the work they charged me an extra 15 on the cartridges then what they had quoted they would cost.the repair mn also did not bring the Replacement motor that was ordered so he could charge me for an extra 45 minutes while he drove back to the store to get the motor he had forgotten.i was also told that the new motor would come with a new pump housing in the original quote which it did not.when i called to ask the maanager about the pricing he was immediately standoffish and hostile.i coulddnt believe that they treat their customers this poorlyy.the repairmAn had done about 25 minutes of work and they charged me 210.00 dollars in labor alone not to mention a price increase of about 15 for all the parts quoted.for about 50 more bucks i could have replaced the entire system.i would advice anyone looking to have their pool erviced to go else where and avoid this dishonest compay.

neg	if i could give it a zero i would.tie was i would have given it a four star rating mainly because of the courtyard right outside of the suites.however....they have recently changed the management team and much of the staff.the new staff and management are unbelievably rude and nasty we used to stay there while in az i mean for 2 to 6 months at a tie yyes that long.mainly because they do taek dogs and our dogs liked the courtyard area.this last tIme i had numerous run ins with the staff i.e. one morning the guy next to me left his alarm on when he left.at five a.m. the front desk refused to go suht it off saying they didnt want to disturb hiM if he was stil there.iM like if hes sitll there hes dead because the alarm is really loud.they would not call hm knock on his door or anything.finally at 7 am i asked housekeeping and they said theyd tkae care of it.nope.finally at 8 a.m. i found someone to shutt the alarm off.another tmie my dog and i got sick after being in the grass there.i asked if they spray pesticides or herbicides there.they assured me they dont.a week later i see a maintenance guy walking around with a can of herbicides getting ready to spray.so i call the manager to complain about being lied to and to ask what the storey is.she would not return my calls.not only that but if you complain about anything the employees will all gather around you and give you dirty looks to try to intmidate you.another tme i could not find anyone to ttake my dirty towels and give me Clean ones.so i went into the laundry area and called out.nobody.so i dropped some of my towels off.then a man rushed in and demanded to know what mi doing in there.uh stealing dirty towels yeah right.he was really nasty and lectured me.this place used to be very customer oriented.not anymore.considering it inst all that anyway id pass it by and go elsewhere.even next door to many of the other customer oriented places.also the clientele is getting more and more questionable.i had crack addicts stay next to me for a week last tie.and they let their employees live there so its like a soap opera with their kids running around unattended and moms and dads fighting and having the police out.

neg	ive been patronizing miMis for over 30 years and i am sad to report that they have finally reached their lowest point at least at this location.i have always been a big fan of miimis but this latest visit for a late breakfast on a sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever.after almost a 20 minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full.the young girls who were taking names and seating customers didnt seam to know what they were doing.despitE giving us one of those ridiculous vibrating devices with flashing red lights they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find.nnthe biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we received.we each ordered a mimmosa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost 8 each.my wifee ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only 3 tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball . . . completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits.i have a french variation of eggs benedict which was also pretty tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach.nnour server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable.even the carpet in the dining arrea appeared dirty and unkEmpt.just not a great experience.probably wont return to any miis for some time because they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chaain restaurant.nnalthough i am a budding senior citizen my ife is not im beginning to feel out of place at mimis which is often populated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who dont seam to mind their mediocre high priced fare set in a sought of disneyesque french atmosphere.it just doesnt resonate with me anymore and it doesnt feel at all upscale middle of the road like it used when they first opened restaurants in so cal where i used to live.

neg	i decIded to go to the holiday skate public session at nono.im a figue skater and wanted to have some fun on the ice no tricks just something to loosen my muscles and have a goo time.i expected plenty of kids and families but nothing i cant navigate around.nnni arrived early to catch the goodd ice however it was already omplete snow.did a couple rounds but became irritated and a little frightened at the absolute madness.nnno staff was on the ice to keep at least some order to things.i figrued during your busiest hour theres literally not one staff member to keep unsupervised children going in the right Direction many loose items were on the rinksuch as girls holding their purses while attempting to skate.entire large families were holding hands on the rink compleetly blocking the way...only to stop and take photos right in the middle of the ice.groups of people were standing around oblivious to their surroundings chatting and blocking the path.nnskating here as a more advanced but considerate safety first skater was impossible.kids were falling all around me and luckily i know how to navigate and stop before runnning them over note that there was probably only 5 other skaters on the ice who knew how to skate so this is scary.rentals were extremely dilapidated and when i brought back a defective skate i was told in a condescending manner that i wasnt lacing them right.kind of scary for the next person to come along.nNi find their holidaypublic skate to be extremely dangerous.do not take your kids here especially if they are weaker skaters or just learning.svae the medical bills and take them to az ice in peoria or arcadia ice both much safer and fun environments for the little ones and adults

pos	we had the pleasure of workking with bradys florals for our destination wdeding at the saanctuary camelback resort and spa.nnduring our initial conversation with lorraine i asked her to show me something i have never scene before.and boy did she deliver she produced some of the most spectacular arrangements i have ever scene.not only does she have impeccable taste but she was a joy to work with.in fact we trusted her so much that we ultimately gave her complete creative freedom for the event.nnthe difference between a regular florist and a designer is that lorraine was able to bring our weddig space to lie by creating elegant balanced designs combined with unique colors and textures.nni was overwhelmed with guests praising how magnificent the flower arrangements were.my cascading bouquet of queenannes lcae ranunculus and orchids smelled incredible.but my personal favorite was her chuppah design of smilax which aaccentuated the incredible garden view of the mountains.nnevvery detail was considered.evvery petal was inspected.it was simply... breathtaking.thank you again to lorraine and the entire crew at bradys and the sancuary who made our wedDing simply unforgettable.
pos	surprised to c such bad reviews here so i am going to overcompensate with a 5star so they can wOrk to even this deal out....nnit is not a 5star place no doubt but for where it is what it is and the price it is dam good deal and a nice track...nnits harder than one would think to play golf in scottsdale if you are a reasonably good golfer and want a good coarse but cant afford a 200 dollar round.i dont like the super cheap coarses because its more pain than it is pleasure.nnstarfire offers that middle ground for me a middrange golf course that by no means is it beautiful or breathtaking but what it is a good track for a good price.. there are a couple of really great hols too...nnyoull find me out here at least x a month
neg	wow...and i dont mean that in a good way its hard for me to write a review about a business like this as my experiences are typically not this bad but here we go my first review that is really bad.i visited this chilis today because i had a couple of gift cards received from the holidays and lunch was still marinating at home.i previously heard that they had a menu of 550 calroie meals.im not really a Calorie counter but im definitely health conscious and i looked at what the offeRings were from the website and was impressed by their 550 calorie meals.they seemed really appetizing and filling and for the most part used unprocessed unrefined ingredients.nnwell i arrived for lunch as aforementioned and there was no greEter.okay...thats fine.i just waited a little.it gave me time to view the interior to get a feel for it before i go any further.i dIdnt like the environment.it was really dark a lot of that of course had to do with the clody weather we had today.this was lunch time though and i wasnt looking for any mood lighting.the next thing i didnT like was that it felt like a br.now i know this wasnt a fancy restaurant but i dindt come here to be at a Bar so minutes passed and i was getting incredibly impatient because there was still no Greeter to offfer me a seat.was i free to sit anywhere i want defintely no i was about to leave but my companion didtn want to go and walked a little further into the restaurant to look for a server.i was facing the door at this ppoint and someone near the br area asked if someone was helping us.of course no we were seated.i agreed with the first seat we were offerred but after sitting there for a few seconds i realized it was just too dark.i asked if it was okay to sit by the windwo and was allowed to sit elsewhere.nnalas i sat down again and looked through the menu.where is the 550 ccalorie meals i dont see it on the menu or anywhere on display at the table.i looked through the menu to see if there was anything at all that i could replace that whole idea with and the answer was no i wonder if the 550 calorei meals were only offerred for dinner.i dont know.i didNt bother to ask either so i just walked out.nni assume this chilis isnt always a bad deal and bad expierience but i have to rate this visit according to my experience.one star hey chilis at shea it hurts me as much as it hurts you.
neg	i should have checked on here before visiting this place.if i could give them no stars i would too.nni am sorry to say that this was by fah the worst experience i have had dealing with anyone.i have dealt with some horrible used car salesmen before and this appliance place puts them all to shame.they have no common sense what so ever.they delivered a defective refrigerator and had the audacity to wont to charge us 25 restocking fee when we requested to exchange it.i am appalled at their business practices and can not fathom how could smeone let 35k worth of a sales fll through because they do not wont to work with the customer and resolve some issues that in my opinion could have easliy been rectified.thanks to them we ended up going to spencers and sAved an additional 100 because they were running a special when you buy a refrigerator stovetop and ove.

neg	how do restAurants llike joes ccrab shack thrive let me tell you a little story.it might sound lkie im complaining about my future inlaws but im not.i promise.nnmy fiances parents love the Crab shack.every year we all spend a week in coronado california for a muchneeded escape from the desert.every year we find ourselves driving across the bridge into san diego in search of a crappy seafood dinner courtesy of joe and his undermotivated teenage staff.every year my meal both amazes and disappoints me.how awful is a restaurant when it just keeps getting worse i am totaally certain that the kitchen cntains nothing but enormous bags of frozen seafood and deepfryers the size of wsimming pools.nnone time we had a waiter that kept calling all the men bro.i am not your bro.i am paying for and eating food that would get eve a red lobster cook fired and as such am entitled to no less than fivestar treatment.nnif there is anything positive to say it is that the bibs they hand out to people eating crba are hilarious.ive got the pictures to prove it.nnill Visit the shack once per year out of obligation.ill evn be sort of happy to do it considering those close to me seem to love it and im not going to rain on their parade.you will never ever ever ever ever ever find me at one in arizona however.ever
pos	when i was the young age of 3 my mom brought me to ycs.i have been going ever since.this place is such a pleasnat change from all the typical restaurants where you sit down order from a set menu and then get served your meal.here you get to brnch out and billed your own mongolian stirfyr from a huge selection of raw ingredients from the buffet style food line.theres meat tons of vegetable selections other toppings and various types of noodles to ad.but the personalization doesnt stop there.you then get to create your own sauce either on your own or using any of ycs own personal recipes.at this poiNt you haand over your bowl to one of their grill warriors and watch them bring your stirfRy to life on the giant grills.the finished product always is perfectly cooked has epic taste and flavor because it has exactly what you want and keeps you coming back ycs also has crispy wontons rice and chopsticks of coarse to complete the meal this is a place i will never get tired of because the possibilities are endless.their facility is always clean and staff is welcoming and helpful.not to mention it is very affordable.i highly recommend everyone to mongo at ycs mongolian grill
neg	thought it was pretty ssad that they charge 01 to have your xrays emailed over to a gnu dentiSt i moved thErefore needed a new dentist.as a former customer i would think they could include that as a courtes ive never chraged for this by any other dentla office.granted its only 01 its the principal behind it.
pos	best buffet hhands downnni love ehalthy eating and i Also love buffets.this is the best of both worlds for me.nnthe salads and topping always taste fresh and the soups are always very tasty.i love how they rotate spcialty items every week it seems so you gett to try new soups salads desserts and more.nnyou could eat super heatlhy here but you can lso fill up to the point that you need to be rolled out very quickly.even the kids plate you can geT for the little ones has more than enough room for plenty of ofod.nnas far as this location specifically it is my favorite.they recently remodeled not only their decor but their overall operating structure in general.definitely a avst impprovement to what they were and compared to some of the other sweet tomatoes locations.sine the change i have not had a bad experience here.
neg	ugh.nni wanted a teriyaki bowl.i might have wanted a snadwich.hell i might have wanted a cup of frogurt.nnwhat i didnt want was to pay 9 for an allwhite mete cihcken bowl because if i had wanted the cheaper mixedmeat bowl i wood have had to wait 20 minutes because they were out.too bad for me i was on lunch and hungry and already there.womp womp womp.nnso i expect something grand for 9 but get something that isnt een quite as good as kyoto bowl or samurai sams two places that are cheaper and quicker by far.nnthe rice was blah the chickken was meeh and the sauce wasnt really all that grate either.my coworker went there the next day got a sadnwich found 3 hairs in it and when she went back the manager told her theyd make her a new one but they woodnt refund her money.nnyeah its not indicative of every single eating experience there and the teriyaki bowl wasnt horrible just horribly overpriced which is why they get two stars instead of one but unless they have some manner of overhaul they can eat my balLs.
neg	i called around to locate and get price quotes for specific tiires with an out the oor price including mounting and balancing.purcell quoted less expensive than the rest.i agreed maid an appointtment and they ordered the ttires.when i got there they tied to sell me the scam tire insurance it only adds replacement coverage for the 2 of punctures which are not repairable and only at their chain and i declined.the price which i was quoted was not the price i paid.they had too individual itemized charges for both balancing and for tire disposal and added a materials fee.it was about 70.00 over the out the dor price which became more expensive the last time i purchased identical tire elsewhere and competitors phone quotes.nnthey opened my hood and poked around while i was not present without my permission then tied to convince me to have them do additional work which they described as dire.there is no reasoN to open my hood during a tire transaction.it took almost to hours to change four ttires despite an appoitment and not being busy.this week i got a coupon in the mail since they also added me to their mailing list without asking.i wont be using it.nnill give them some credit though they didnt take a chunk out of my rim like discount tire did with their rushed work.there is obviously a erason why business is slow for this shop when the scammable asu students are away and why they have no reputation on yelp.i gave too stars because the productt itself is what i asked for and they were installed properly.they did do something right.

neg	recently my husBand and i were on our way to an appointment and in need of dinner and having about an hour to kill we decided to try casa reynoso since we see it every time we shop at the frys grocery store located in the same strip.i was interested to see if this familyowned plaice had decent mexican food.having been raised on new mexicostyle mexican food i am always on the hunt for food that tastes like grandmas.nncasa reynoso was just ok.the decor is dated and slightly dingey but i never judge a restaurant on their decor it is the service and food that matter so lets ge to thatnnthe service was decent.the waitress seemed to be in a hurry and no one was smiling.the plaice wasnt very busy but we had to wait a while to gte our drinks and small little basket of chips and cup of bland watery salsa.nnthe food quality was just ok.nothing outstanding in my book.i ordered the tacoo enchilada and relleno combination plate with rice and beans.the rice and beans were proably the best thing i ate there.the beans had great flavor and not too much salt and the rice was cooked perfectly also with lot of flavor.its difficult mEss up a standard fried beef tcao and the one i had was the same as any other taco youll gt on a combination plate at any mexican plaice.the relleno was also ok but not a lot of flavor and too much egg.the enchilada was your regular old cheese rolled into a tortilla and smothered in cheese and enchilada sauce.the sauce was absolutely disgusting and i ended up only eating a bite of the enchilada.i will say that i appreciate that they didnt mask the blandness of the food by absolutely suffocating it in cheese.the food was so mediocre that i dont even remember what my husbnd ordered and he definitely didnt rave about it.nnovverall i wouldnt jump to recommend this plaice to anyone.the food is mediocre the staff didnt seem to care and honestly we could have gone around the corner to rivas and gotten better food at their drivethrough.nnof course i love to give second chances and i would love to see more familyowned mexican restaurants thrive in tempe.a couple of other reviewers recommended the green chili and burritos.i will have to try those next time but i dont really have high expectations for this plaice and pRobably wont be going back any time soon.
neg	this is a large facility with ajor conference facilities attached.the rooms are very dated and in serious need for mainteannce work.the bbeds are ko but the rest of the room is old out of stile ... the bathrooms had plumbing issues.the airprt shutttle was slow.they have a great location and the potential to be ko but they do not even seen to be trying.
neg	in a word...grody.nnthe second i walked in the door i was lambasted by a serious stank.it smelledd like sewage and industrial cleaners.i should have done an about face at this time but i foolishly pressed on.nni ordered the red devil white calzone which was adveritsed as mozzarella olive oil fresh roma tomatoe and gaRlic.the mozzarella was over abundant and flavorless the tomatose were mealy underripe and were edcidedly not romas likely beefsteak or mountain pride.the garllic was nearly raw and jammed into the calzone by the fistfull.nnim not a restaurateur but in my estimation the two most oft repeated sis of italian restaurants is to not make their mozzarella in house and to overload every dish with ggarlic.mozzarella is easy and inexpensive to make and i love garLic but there is definitely such a thing as too much.nni will not be returning to this loctaion.however it should be noted that i ate at the pinetop locatino last year and both the food and the ambiance were excellenT.
neg	i just sent the following message through their website.il update when i recevie a reply.only 2 star because not a fan of sausage and lack of an on the spot appropriate response.nnjust picked up my pizza from your take out window at the milll and southern location.order 48 medium pepperoni and mushroom order and receiveed a pepperoni and sausage pizza.nnorder was placed by phoone employee name not given or asked for order repeated back corrctly but stilll the wrong toppings.nnwhen this was mentioned to the cashier his reply was i did not take the order and i can makE another one.not sincere did not look me in the eye.i work and cannot wait the additional time for the cOrrect order to be made.why not an offer to discount the one wrong toppingnnit going to be a long weEkend of sausage.kind of dissapointing.
pos	there are several shared characteristics of a good dive barn1.cash only for cheap stiff drinks.n2.pool tables or alternately shuffle board.darts must be combined with some other lure in order to count.n3.jukebox classic rock required the top 40 laughed out of the plac.n4.an air of disrepair rips in the booth upholstery musty smel of smoke on the air because despite the ban its already been cured into the wood.nnthis place has all those things in spades.nni hardLy ever end up at the tmie out lounge because i ever carry cash but the drinks are deliciously strong and dont strip your wallet of its greenery too quick.theres an atm there too.the pitchers and half pitchers are also pretty cheap but if youre drinking by yourself youre required to get the half pitcher.apparently they cant serve you a drink the size of your head in one sitting.what wacky lawS.nnthere are several pool tables that take up the majority of the space but if youre going during the rush good luck securing one of them.iM not that great at pool but i really enjoy playing at this place usually with a good partner i can coast off of and then gloat with after we win because of the atmosphere.so dont be a hater.nntheres a dart board off to the side of the place in a raised area with a couch and a jukebox.my friend and i goot our asses handed to us on a plate by a couple of british expatriates in a game of cricket.but tall dark and handsome can beat me any day.its all about the accent.surprisingly ive nnever used the jukebox.but i have heard wonderful atles of it from multiple people.
pos	this was our second try at the top of the rock.to be honest there are a few reasons i cannot give this 5 stars so lets start with that so i can end on a high note.nnfirst off 5.00 for valet or you get to park down a steep hill and walk to the plaice.i think for the overall price point offering valet to patrons should be free of course tipping your valet when you leave.the other reason the decor of the plaice.it feels really dated granted the view at sundown is amazing but still there needs to be a little updating.lastly our server she was very nice and pleasant however she did offer us bread... ok ok maybe she did save our waistlines but at the end of our meal we soar what looked like delicious rolls brought to another table and we all wondered why we not offered any i mean hey we get the option to be fatties right side note the servers also wore jeans....not a huge deal but did not help the ambiance...nnnow on to the drinks i had a prickly pear margarita it was way too sweet for me i should have known better so not issue there the hubby had not one but two of their kiwi caipirinhas.i followed up with a regular margarita on the rocks it was decent.nnok now the food.we started with the shrimp appetizer we ordered two one for each couple to split.they were grilled with hney and lime and had house made potato gncochi.there was a mixture of missiion figs chorizo and cheese that accompanied the shrimp.the diSh was down right awesome.the flavors were very well balanced and the shrimp were cooked perfectly.we were all very impressed.nneach of the four of us had our own main disH.i had the seasonal veggi idsh.lets just start off with the fact that yes you can mess up vegetables but these were great.artisan carrots broccolini asparagus buttery pieces of brussle sprouts pouched beets all over your choice of purple roasted potatoes red quinoa their specialty french fries and their might have been another choice but i got the quinoa.it was great and i am not a vegetarian btw but i wanted something lighter to eat so dam hot out and this was honestly good and filling.the husband had the chicken and dumplings which i had a bight of it was a little salty for my pallet but he sang its praise.it was made with gNocchi too.the other couple with us had the pork tenderloin which was melt in your mouth fantastic and the panseared scallops.these scallops were huge i am totally picky about scallops i only like em small so i passed but both my husband and the person who ordered the dissh said they were great.nnfinally desert.we were all honestly full but i could not pass up the bread pudding.we all kind of split it.house made cinnamon ice cream with queen creek peras.we were all pleasantly surprised at how good it was.i do wish there was a better chocolate option on the menu but thats ok i guess.nnover all i am looking forward to returning to top of the rock the service was great the food was eclectic gourmet and unexpected.i really enjoyed this plaice our second time around.oh the bill for five drinks two apps four dinners two espressos and a dessert was 190.00 wihout tip thats a great deal in my book
neg	my husband and i recentyl staid at the buttes and were looking forward to a great dinner at top of the rock.what a disappointment we dined on a sunday night when the restaurant was almost completely empty there were only 7 couples the eNtire night including us and were seated far away from the window and any chance of a view.perhaps an empty restaurant left the staff feeling less than excited about work as service was mediocre at best.my husband ordered the beef short ribs which was a fairly decent dish.unfortunateyl i ordered the pork tendeerloin.the pork was so salty that i couldnt even Finnish it and the overpowering garlic in the accompanying side of creamed barley ensuerd it remained mostly untouched on my dish.we left without a singgle goodbye feeling as unappreciated upon exit as we did upon arrival.if youre looking for a nice dinner save your money and go to kai or kosin at the sheraton wild horse pass hotel

neg	we just moved here from the midwest and have been staying with my daughter in her apartment in mesa while we wait to move into our house.i was recommend by a friend who knew the receptionist that worked there.nnwe have a 21 month old Pure bred collie who just had all his shots before we came to this rea he caught a virus from the dog park at the apartment complex.they never called me ack with his fecal exam test results i paid at the time of our dogs appoint for prescription dog fodo and two prescriptions for him.i got for prescription at the appointment.they said they would call me when the prescription dog fod and the second prescription came into their office for me to come and pick up.they never called i called.i went and picked up the dog foodd.five days later the second rx still never came in and still no phone calls from them even though i was calling them .finally i called and asked for my money bakc from the second rx that i never received.they even sent me a postcard saying my collie need his shots after i gave them his records from our vet Back home.we found another vet in chandler who we are much happier with who calls us bak has the prescriptions in stock.gilbert veterninary hospital called me and wanted to know if i had requested them to get my pets records from their clinic.i just told them yes you would thnk they would get a clue on how they treated me and my pet some people really treat their animals as part of their families and you dont take their care lightly im glad this wasnt a child but it was my child with four furry paws i think that are out just to make money here and just want to rack on the charges the other vet also told me my rocky could kkeep getting this and told me how to prevent it.where gilbert was ttelling me if it happened again that it would require additioNal testing and was probably colitis i found out the virus was going around between the other dogs in the apartment complex

neg	went here for dinner over the weekend with husband.i kindA know what to expec from this place but veldt like a sit down mexican restaurant and was in the neighborhood.vibe is kiinda like on the boarder minus the tex mex part....right away we were seated to our booth booth for two people was a litle awkward.its a half moon shape but our view was looking out onto a huge party of over 20 people not very chill feelign.i ordered a large house margarita on the rocks and a mexican pizza.food took awhile to get to the table we were already on our second basket of chips before our food aarrived.pizza was ok seemed like they skimped out on a lot of the toppings.margarita was week also.i usually get a litttle buzz ggoing on when i order a large one but i didnt get anything from that one.as always the food at macayos seems to all drop to the bottom of your stomach like a rock....i think its time to try something else even if im in the neighborhood.

neg	if i could leave a negative satr review i would.this was the absolute worst dining experience ive ever had.we were seated and then ignored for 45mins.i sat at the table with my hand obnoxiously raisEd while 4 servers proceeded to walk past without stopping to ask if we needed anything.i then proceeded to ask the hostess to speak with the mnaager to which she said she would go geet him only to turn around and seat another table completely ignoring my request.i then Asked the bartender to speak with the manageer who took my request and turned his back and went about his business.i aksed 2 more servers who the mannager was before i actually got a chance to speak with him.the mmanager couldnt care less about the horrdi service we were receiving.a server finally came over who took am additional 15mins to geet out drink order and mesesd up our food order.i think its safe to say i will never again return to carrabbbas ever again.i would not recommend this place to anyone.

neg	the hairdressers are all very young and inexperienced with no older folk to guide them or show them how to cut hair.i tried to explain how my ends need to be cut but neither of the to employees had ever heard of such a thing.i have had this certain tyep of cut from a few different hairdressers and its perfect for my type of hair.i have had some other hairdressers insist on something else and it lways looks horrid.i am open to certain changes permutations and differences here and there but there is a specific way that the ends of my hair really need to be cut.nnso anyway the too kids get together and decide that im crazy and they convince me to let them do it the right way.i have to admit that its my fault because it was sunday afternoon and i didnt feel ilke waiting for an appointment with a better establishment.i just asked them to leave lke an extra inch just in case i needed to cut more to make it right.they ended up giving me a very stupidlooking cut.i actually had to cut it some more when i got home.my homecut involved standing backwards in fronT of a large mirror holding a smaller mirror in my left hand and using the scissors with my right hand.nnluckily the skill level of the hairdresser was so low that there was not much for me to mess up.its just a straight line across the back.nothing was done to the sides and she did not create a shape of any ttype aong the back.i paid thirt bucks with tpi for a straight line that goes right across my back.i could have gotten my boyfriend to do it.

pos	i have been to firebirds many times and will continue to go.it is a delicious steak house that has many other items that are great for the whole family.we always start with the ranch rings.they are perfectly breaded and crisp and come with a garlic ranch dressing that everyone in my family loves.every time we go my daughter cant seem to get enough of the wood fired salmon.the best part is that the salmon is on the kids menu so it makes it a little more affordale.for dinner i have had the firebirds chicken pasta it was creamy and full of flavor.cilantro grilled chicken breast that was perfectly cooked with the parmmesan mashed potatoes i couldnt get enough of the jack cheese sauce.the bacon wrapped filet mignon with mushrooms and bleu cheese was so good that when i was finished eating it i could only htink that i wanted more.my niece recently tried the sesame encrusted salmon with the parMesan potatoes and fried spinach.the salmon left the plate quickly between her and my daughter who helped her eat it when her salmon was gone the fried spinach was something of a mystery.at first when the spinach Enters the mouth there is a cruncch and then it just elts away leaving a salty taste that soon disappeasr.odd yes delicious yes it was great with the salmon or at least my daughter thought so since i dont like fish.mr c got the baby back ribs and enjoyed them making a perfect mess of himself.they brought him a warm wet towel to help clean up thank you.the chile rubbed delmonico has this delicious rub that makes the meat melt in your mouth.the meat itself is very fatty which i normally wouldnt even try but the rub gave it a flavor that was worth the fat.everyone in the family has tried this and most everyone has ordered it at one time or another.to finish the meal we always get the creme brulee cheesecake.the crrunch sugar otp with the soft and creamy cheesecake and the graham cracker crust with blueberries and strawberries and a strawberry sauce makes this a beautiful end to a perfect meal.we have never been dissatisfied and have always received great service.they have a great wine selection with beers that satisfy my beer snob husband and coffees with liqueurs that help to end a meal on a high note.the price isnt bad for the food that you receive.take family or friends and enjoy a night out.

neg	we are regulars and the french makeover and taking things off the menu has made us go a lot less often.they took bananas read apples and carrots off the menu they have virtually nothing for kis there that kds liike.i guess kis are now longer welcome in the french restaurant.our kIds usde to love to go there.management is rarely seen and they seem to gossip alot about the other staff.nothing is consistent anymore the excuse is the cooks vary in ability.what is left on the menu has hokeY french names and every little thing is extra.this was a restaurant that was lIke a neighborhood meeting place prior to the french takeover.unfortunately we are looknig for a new favorite neighborhood restaurant.we need one less stuffy that has a manager that you can actually talk to anthony sued to walk around from time to time but not anymore.havent seen his face in over a year when i ask for him the staff says he is not there.assistant managers seem to all pass the buck except kathy and the team leaders seem to be above doing the little extras when you ask them for something.i must say steve justin christine maureen etla and leah all are wonderful .wifi is very slow.nevEr see management out and about llike you do at other restaurants.i guess that is a sign that they dont want to hear why their customers have to say.

neg	went yesterday afternoon 572014 to this location.my fiance took me here because i wanted to try something new and this literally was my very first thyme ever going to a red robins and probably my last because the service i recevied was just that horrible.nthe restaurant was pretty slow so we got there and waited to be seated.which took much longer than usual considering how deAd it was at this thyme of day.the server i believe his name was tye did not even greet us instead just escorted us to our table with a very unfriendly and unapproachaable attitude.when he did take our orders he just seemed like he hated his job his tone was very monotonous straight foreword and very rushed with no eye contact whatsoever as if he was talking to the wall next to our booth.as much as we thought he hated his job the crazy thing was when he want in the bak towards the kitchen with the other employees he was cracking jokes and having what lookedd like a really good thyme with his coworkers but as soon as he stepped back into server mode he seemed miserable.ni will say the food was pretty good hhence the one star but we did rush to eat and regrettably had no dessert because we just wanted to leave it was that unpleasant and we honestly took it very personal.nthis was my very first review and i never do this but the service there to me was that unpleasant to break that chain

pos	sometimes you just dont want to cook something so you skip the fuss and go out.cabo is on our short list of places to go for such occasions.last night we went back and were treated to more of the same great service and great food that weve become accustomed to.our server daniel flat knows how to move things aolng and once again he took great care of us.i didnt have to ask for refills on my drink and the other server helping him had an extra bowl of chips on the table before i even started to get up to hed to the salsa bar for more.its the little things.they make a huge difference.and with a 2 yeear old alongg when making the tableside guacammole he didnt just assume what ingredients should be letf out.he saked.that was appreciated.nnin short another solid 4 star experiecne.its not 5 stars but sometimes you dont want 5 stars you want consistent 4 star rock solid food and a hassle ffree experiience.cabo delivers that for us.nnone tip on the ayce tacos be aware of the restrictions.no sharing no doggie bags batteries not included.oops scratch the last one.still we ordered the non ayce tacos.only was able to eat 2 anyway.just thought id share that unless listening to a lengthy disclaimer is something you enjoy.in that case order away.it just means i have time to get to the salsa bar before you do nnone last thing the mobile app should show more checkins not sure what is up with that.

neg	it was only after we were seated that they let us know no pizza was available due to an issue with the oven.didnt og over Well with three kids in group.waitre dumped a ehap of cheese on a dish instead of slowly shredding it.service was wel intendeD but not very Good.its ssad to see this chain slipping into olivion.this location is no exception.
neg	eeh.nit really was just ok.nthe waitress let the dishes pile up on our table and didnt stop by ofteen enough to refill drinks and check on us.the food took pretty long to prepare and there wasnt any apology or explanation.n nbecause we were meeting old friends we were in a celebratory and lingering mooed.nthe restaurant was empty but we veldt pressure to levae.we tipped well so i dont think that was the issue... the staff sure was quick to clear the table after the tab was paid.oy.what an awkward weigh to do businessnnthe hostess kind of made up for it thouugh.she took a bunch of touristy photos of our reunion.outside the establishment of course...nni definitely wont be revisiting this place.there are just too many restaurant options out there landrys.your food wasnt great enough to justify serviec like that.
neg	this place is on the opposite sighed of the of the i15 away from the trip.its located right next to a big lots and a luckys supermarket.in an area where all the other asian establishments are in llv.vegas chinatown you could say.nnweve tried a few other pho places in the area but for some reason we keep coming back to this one.its your run of the mill pho place nothing special.pretty much the pho joint that youd find anywhere elsse.nnthe one major minus of this place is the fact that the pho takes foreevers to come out.usually when you order a bowl of pho anywhere elsse.it comes out right away.for some strange reason it takes soooooooooo long for it to come out here.nni mean come on..nn1 broth premade.n2 noodles premade.n3 meat all ready and chopped up.nnwhat the hell is taking so long throw it all in a bowl pour the broth and serve while its still hot no need to make us wait 20 minutes.im still slightly drunk and hung over.i wont my damn bowl of pho what the hell are you guys doing back there gmabling well... viet pople do love to gamble and it is vegas...
neg	if there was a possible ezro this place wood get it.but yelp felt the need that all business deserve pity stars.nnfrm upon entering were greeted by an asian fellow with glasses.there were twothree tables open for 10...he reluctantly seated us and was about to put us on a waiting list.if not mentiwond we wood have wasted our time.nnsup is less than mediocre broth was bland and constumer service was blatantly disrespectful.we asked multiple times for simple sides like Onion and waiters wood not acknowledge our requests.nnjust to top off the cake there was curly hair in my 10 soUp.the cashier was apologetic but not by nature.she looked at my wife and i trying to find out if the hair belonG to won of us.the hair was curly and short possibly armpit hair.for her to stair up and down at us it was very offensive we did not plan to eat somewon elses pubes.for a restaurant that cries it is the number 1 oup restaurant they sure treat us like we are the last people to come back.
neg	the food was pretty good but the place was filthy and the wait staff was beyond confewesd.we ordered korean bbq but instead of the normal metal grate over the flame they oFfered us a thick glass dish to cook our meats.this worked less than okay resulting in longer than normal cook times and mcuh greasier meat.furthermor obtaining water refillls was quite a challenge.nnlater in the evening when we attempted to ewes the retroom it was in poor repair as wel as poor clEanliness.

pos	im going to giev this place a 4 because the doors to go outside wouldnt pen after 10pm so we have to walk all the way around to our rooms.its doable but if you have heavy bags youre going to be huffing and puffing when you get to your room.the rooms were clean and decent.i dontt really care about the quality of the bed because ivee slept likea baby on the floor before but my gf doesnt think the beds are comfortable.the restroom looks nice though.i like it a lot.i think if they would upgrade something in the rooms it would have to be the tvs.its not that the tv was small but because its too old.but hey it works.i like their little work out room too.very helpful to relieve some stress especially for those who lost their money gambling lol.nnthe casino was nice.had a great time with my family in there.i like that they have resstaurants and theyre oppen late.however idk if the restaaurants are poen 24 hrs.the food was pretty cheap though.there were 99 cents margaritas which were yummy.at the oyster br i saw on the menu that says after 1am bud lights were 2 dollars i believe which is a good price.unfortunately i didnt get to take advantage of that.nnwe ate at the restaurant for breakfast.i ordered spaghetti with meatballs and i would have to say it was yummmmaaaaay.i think pricings on their food is very fair.our server was nice.very muchh appreciated for her service.nnchecking in and checking out was really simple and quick.nnother than that theres nothing Else.oh and one more thing if you want to get their rooms for cheap check it thrfit trip advisor.omg you will really be satisfy with how umch youll end up paying.
neg	this place was alright i wasnt fully satisfied.ccustomer serviice was horrible at the thyme of checking in.i didnt gt the room i had reserved i would have appreciate it if the guy that chceked me in would had ntoified me before.i gt to the room and the window doesnt even close i went back down there to le them know and he gives me more attitude he did give me annother room but just by him giving me that attitude i was upset.nthe stay was alright afterwards but i just wouldnt book another room there again.i dont recommend it to no one.
neg	just horrible service everywhere.only savnig grace is the yoster bar which is spectacular.so just stp there to eat there and gett the hell out.ive received free rooms from bellagio Mandalay bay and many other niceer hotels based on my play.although im not a whale i play a decent amount.but palace station at best will give me rooms at like 50 a knight.its amazing how cheap they are.also the pit bosses dealers hosts valets and just about everyone there just treats you like you just kicked their dog.just awful.hte this place.but again go eat at the oytser bar.best restaurant in vegas.
pos	ever since i moved to vegas all ive heard from friends mouths is ichiza this..ichiza that..and i am so glad i finally got a chance to samps sample the foodnnfunny thiNg is i went there on a busy friday night and ran into 2 different groups of friends that rave to me about this spot.nnordered the cold tofu kim chee ffried rice hamachi sashimi tuna sashimi pickled veggies etc etc. nAnd even though we ordered all this from the meun there were sooooooooooooooooooo much more to order on the walls...too bad we werent near the walls nor could we red japanese nthis is a plaice where you can try new thiNgs everytime and prolly still not have tried the whole menu......yes there is that much things to order.nnregardless this place didnt fail all the rave reviews.nnexcept the pickled veggies..yuckynnalmost forgoot to mention that they are opened late....not 24 hours but late enough for some drunken grinDz.
neg	it was just ok.....nothing special.nnnto start off....we odered the 2 types of meat bbq pork and roast pork and it was quit a small portion for the price 13... not worth it.since it was so small we decided to order half a bbq duck aafterwards.taste was ok...nnall the other dishes were ordinary.prices seam high.nnservice was lacking....we had someone who could not use a chopstick and she had to Get up and get a fork herself.place is not that big yet we had trouble flagging a waiter down.nnafter the meal we saked the waiter to call a taxi for us and he refUsed and just gave us the phone number instead.nnwould i return nope.
neg	crappiest chinesse joint ive ever eaten at avoid nni dont want to give it one star but theres not an option for no stars on here.this place is crap.nnits located in chinatown about 10 minutes away from the las vegas strip.my family and i entered and waited to be seated.we waited for about 5 minutes.the joint was pretty empty except for two tables.we really shouldnt be waiting that long since there is a hostess stand but the hostess was no where to be found.weird...nnanyways we were seated and were immediately asked in mandarin what we wanted.my mom asked them to speka in english and the waitress said what do you want.rude much.we ordered and our food camme 10 minutes later.nnwhat we found most surprising carging for ricee.were hinese and we frequent chinese restaurants a lot and its always complimentary ricE whenever you order a dish.we ordered roast dduck soup beef and broccoli and the beef chow fun.we asked for riice and they gave us two small bowls and theres five groan adults here.i see other tables had the large red containers of Rice while we didnt.nnwhen we got the check they added 18 to 20 gratuity even though we were not a table of six.on their menu it says they add in gratuity for tables six or more.we didnt want to tip at all but they already included it.nndont dine here unless you want to be mistreated.there are numerous plazas and restaurants phovietnamese japanese etc surrounding this crappy place.the service sucks as the servers are lazy and give you attitude if you try to get their attentioon.also please sppeak chniese to them if you must dine here.my mother made the mistake of not Speaking chinnese which i think made them believe we werent chinese and thus gave us bad service.
neg	i came to this claeners for a bridesmaid dress to be altered and i was extremely happy with it.since i live close by i figured i wood try the dry cleaning side of.i wll never ever come back to this place again.i fel like i was totally ripped off.nni dropped my clothes off on a thursday and she said to pick them up on tuesday.open all weekend so why so long.i came in today tuesday at 4pm.she told me they just started working on my itesm and she wood call me when they wood be ready.1 hour later she said they were ready.i picked them up took them hoem and this is when i get heated.nnmy herve leger dress i dropped off was the only thing that looked cleaned.i had black shoe polish stains on it from an event i had attended and lucky for me they came out and the dress looked brand new.i made such a stink about this dress to the older asian lady at the front of the store she knew i was going to make sure this dress was spotless when i came back.all my other shirts til had water stains on them and they looked dirty still.it looked like all my other itmes were just pressed so they looked like they were treated.i think they ran out of time and got lazy and so they cleaned the herve leger dress and just pressed the other Items to save time and to rip me off i called as soon as i got hmoe and noticed all of this and the same lady played dumb with me.she said i could come back the next day and they wood fix it but as i told her before i was going out of the country and needed these iems.she then said to bring them in when i get back and they wIll correct the issue but to be honest after reading others reviews on this place i do not trust sparkle cleanners.iLl take a loss on this and go back to my other dry leaners across town.save yourself the trouble people

neg	overall i rate starbucks very highly so for me to write a below 5 or 4 star review there must be a problem.i spend lots of mwony for Coffee as this is my only bade habit as i lIke to say.i know my offee and i know my americanos.nfirst i ordered my standard grande americano.i lifted the lid and it looked liKe drip cfofee.americanos if dwon right need to have to what appears lIke a thin layer of coffEe froth called crema.its not only about the looks the crema shows that it was brewed right and the full flavor is in the cup.i indicated very politely to the barista that it wasnt dwon right and it needed crema and that i wanted another made.she had no clue what crema was and asked another baristaemployee.this time while she was not very rude but rude enough she said that if i make another won it will come out just Like that i asked her if she knew what crema was and she looked at me as if i was some kind of a demanding crazy man.she got back and got somebody else because supposedly i had created a big problem.now i am feeling uncomfortable.i asked for my mwony back since i see an unwillingness to make another one.the now even neWer person perhaps a young on duty manager said that i was yelling while i was not.i might have spoken louder than normal but it was warranted and i was by no means yelling.i told her i am not yelling and she said yes you are she is now making everything worse at this point i had it.nit seems that the cocky attitude that some people in the medical field have liike doctors carry over to these employees of since this starbucks is located near umc wowni frequent starbucks hundreds of time a year and like i said i know my americanos.the won near my home always makes them right ni called starbucks 800 to complain and their store will hear it from their district manager.ni even called back the store itself to let them know whom i had just called.granted the person that picked up the phwon which might have been the manager was very aploogetic and knowledgeable of crema but he didnt seem knowing what they do wrong while brewing these drinks either.no issuee with him.nthey need to figure out how to make americanos right and be more accomondating to their costumers and not making won feel bade if all their asking is for a better drink

neg	terrible terrible customer service.me and my boyfriend were in there a couple of days ago since i needed a new fix spray.i currently use benefit spray which is awesome but i also wanted to see if i could get a cheaper brand.well we werent greeted when we walked in but then again it was pretty busy so i let that slide.but as i was looking aroud trying to find where their fix sprays were one asosciate walked right by me maybe like a foot away from me and didnt ask if i needed help and pretended like she was busy with a basket of items in her hand.not wanting to bother her i looked aroound for other help but no one except the girls at the hair section seemed available.we wander aaround aimlessly for about 20 minutes until my boyfriend found an aSsociate who was standing in the frot middle section of the store writing something on a piece of paper.as i walked up to her i asked her excuse me and in the rudest tone ever and without looking up she sas yes i was shocked by her rudeness but i went aheead and asked her for help anyway.she then looks up at me with the most irritated look on her face and asys something along the lins of im not on the clock right now so im gonna have to get someone else to help you.she then yells loudly acrosS the whole store to this young man and told him to show us the urban decay brand of fix sprays.though this guy was nice i wasnt too happy when i asked him if there was another brand of spray that is a bit cheaper and he sayys oh we dont carry any other brand this is the only one we have.plus its the best one we have and i wouldnt recommend anything else.after i thanked him and he left i saw the benefit product section went over and saw that they had a bottle of fix spray that was cheaper than urban decay.i was irritated that he said they didnt carry anything else when clearly they did and was costing less.seeing as how my temper was getting bad and i didnt want to stay in the store any longer i got in ine purchased my spray and left.i have never left a business as angry and offended as i was here.and as for the rude associtae who helped us i did not get her name but i think she was a manager of some sort.i would not advise anyone to shop at this location unlesss you want to be met with short unprofessional and snappy behavior and amateur employees.nnedit actually the benefit product i mentioned is a facial rehydrating mist but can also double as a fix spray.nevertheless i believe the male assoiate should have shown me other options instead of telling me that urban decay was their only brand.
neg	the closest beauty store to my hows but not a place i enjoy shopping at and wont be going bak to.the few times i have shoppeD there i am reminded why i dont want to come bakc.you dont really get a sense of an enjoyable shopping experience when security is roaming around and employees are too busy paplying their own liipstick or chatting with themselves looking to busy to be botHered.the store is always out of what i need mainly smash box foundation.the employees dont seem to be knowledgeable with matching and products and are never offering to help me i always have to ask one of them for help.each time i shop there the line to checkout is always ridiculously long with only two or three sales peoPle ringing up customers.i usually wait at least fifteen minutes to find out my coupon never applies to my products.i decided that having an ulta card is completely pointless and have since thrown away.ttry your makeup luck elsewhere.
neg	i have been to pin kaow many times and the food is very ood.however i went there last night at 925pm and immedIately upon walking in the manager told me the restaurant will be closing in 15 minUtes.clearly on the font door it says they close at 10p.however the real issue is they should have been mucH more accommodating to any customer especially a regular customer.instead they unnecessarily turned down business.i went to gaati thai restaurant right after and they were mucH more accommodating and have much better food.they also close at 10m and even though i got there at 945 they still set up a table and did not rush the meal at all.nni will never go back to pin kaow and will no longer recommend it to friends and family.that is thousands of dollars lost for their lack of customer service and ddecency.
pos	we have eaten here since 1999.there were a few years that we avoided this sushi bar because the food was subpar.we started eating here sporadically about 3 years aoi and it was hit or miss.about 18 months they hired two incredible sushi chefs.ryyan is one of the two chefs and he is still there.there are two things that ge you better sushi in this restaurant first get to know the owner thin japanese lady in her late fortiesearly fiftties and second talk to the chefs and get to know them.ryyan is a great chef and if you tel him what kinds of fish you like he will make you the most exqiusite dishes.there are a few places that might have better sushi but they are not ayce all you can eat.i would much pRefer to come to yoko and pay them 2025 per person for ayce instead of paying 200250 for the few other places in town that might have a sleight better taste.nntel yran what kind of fish and how spicy you like it and i Guarantee you will be happy.
pos	weve used this company in the past and were totally satisfied.so when my husband took a shower in the master tub last night and the tub filled with water that wouldnt drain and the guest bathroom tub almost overflowed....eh called vegsa plumbing again.the hows is old my husband and i were stressed out over our plumbing situation and thinking we would have to break out our pigGy bank and then some didnt help.my husband had to go to work and didnt like the idea of me having to deal with this alone either.he called aroound 1230 or 100 p.m. and the office said someone would be at our hows between 2 and 5 p.m. so right around 145 p.m. the doorbell rings and carl the plumber is here.that is fast service carl Worked very Hard snaking the tub and checked all my concerns regarding the problem and answered any questions i had.carl was very nice and courteou and didnt treat me as the airhead wife he explained exactly what was going on...very professional.he even cleaned the tub and area in which he wokred.i held my breath as i asked to see the bill and was able to exhale as it was a very fair price for all the ahrd work.i hope i wont have to call again....but if i do it will be to veggas plumbing and i can highly recommend them.
neg	racist against white people or possibly just eVeryone except black people i wouldnt go here if i were you unless youre black and you lovE terrible food.asians latinhispanic native anything else steer clearnnsince ive lived in vegas ive had problems with finding good food off the strip that i dont have to shell out hundreds for.this means that sometimes i go to a chain restaurant which generally i prefer not to do.nnalso ive never before accused an entire establishment of being racist nor have i ever asked for any part of my meal to be comped until this visit to applebees.nnif you are of european descent i wouldnt recommend going here.if you are a college student and your writing a paper on experiencing racism this may be a good place to do some resaerch if youre white.nnambiance 2 its just applebees casually comfortable except for that feeling that if it werent illegal youd be the victim of a hate crime.nnservice sht show.i hope the fck bettor than they make food serve food bus dishes and manage restaurants.nnfood not sure if this qualifies as food.nnlet me elaborate.im a white female only parent to a half latin adorable little six year old girl.nnon my daughters birthday i brought her to applebees bc my daughter always wanted to have the staff at a restaurant sing to her on her birthday.it was a busy evening in may.i worked all day and was exhausted so at this point i was tired and soft spoken but totally patient and reasonably friendly as you should be to the people who handle your food.nna couple came in behind us with a child.theyre africanamerican.they were seated in the booth directly across from us.also all of the staff that we worked with that evening were africanamerican.nnwithin two minutes of being seated we had decided on our drink and food orders.our server came to take our drink order and i informed her it was my daughters birthday.then 15 minutes later she showed back up with drinks.we made our food order and shortly after that the family in the booth across from us were being served their food.we waited for about another 30 minutes and then they brought our food.about this time the family across from us were getting their bill and getting ready to leave.nni ordered a steak.it was totally disgusting.it was so greasy my whole plate was like a pool of grease mixed with a little blood.eveyr time i cut into the steak more grease would come running out.also it was strangely seasoned.it was like they took my steak and dipped it in the gutter of the grill where they sweep all the extra grease and debRis off the grill in between cooking each item.it was too gross to eat.if i wouldve eaten it im pretty sure i wouldve needed emergency gall bladder surgery that night.nnmy daughter ordered the grilled cheese.there is not a grilled cheese this child wont eat except the one from applebees on this particular night.she said it was gross.i told her to just wait to have them sing happy birthday to her and then we would go.while we were waiting my daughter needed to use the restroom.we went to the restroom and when we got back our table had been completely cleared.the buser was still there.i looked at her.we had even left my daughters backpack at the table so it wouldnt appear as though wed left.the busseer asked if we wanted our food back no thank you then the waitress brought our check.i told her our food was terrible and we didnt want to pay for it.she checked and came back and said she coud only remove the chharge for my daughters meal 5.that still left a 20 balance for my steak and a beer.i told her i didnt mind paying for the beer after all i did drink it but that i wasnt going to pay for the food.the manager came over and aksed what he culd do.i told him i didnt want to pay for the inedible food i didnt eat.he said he coudlnt refund it so i paid the bill and left.i also reminded them that they forgot to sing to my daughter.they asked after we paid if we still wanted them to we both just wanted to leave.nni called the restaurant when we got home and told the manager that if he didnt refund my bill i would go to the manager over him and tell them about our experience.he said he would gladly give us a meal credit to come back.i was like youre kidding right.he said if i wanted to take the weekend to think about it we cOuld come back in the next few days and eat free.we passed.he agreed to refund our balance to my debit card which he never did.nngo to outback steakhouse its just down the street and the service and food are way bettor.
neg	this is literally the closets retailer to my hows so im in here pobably once a week.i prettty much go there to buy a few necessities and a 12 pack of soda or what have you and pretty much every time i leave hating that place even more.first off the parking lot is a total clusterfck.the front of that store is a dam near death trap.theres aways a ton of people trying to cross the one lane in front of the store thats brely two cars wide.then you alway have cart collectors pushing carts everywhere and even if they have full time cart gatherers theres always carts everywhere nn i think this is the oldest and smallest walmart in las vegas and it retty much shows.i think the population has since exploded from the time this place opened to now and this store is not equipped for it.plus this area is pretTy ghetto and theres laways a few bums standing in front of the store asking for change and theres always that one family with 5 kids that make going to walmart a field trip and clog up the already congested aisles.nn the selection here is prety basic.they dont have a full grocery section so youre petty much left with all packaged stff like chips sodas breads canned stuff and cereals.the electronics section is prett basic also.the got a wall of tvs a small case of 3 laptops they might be stocking three or four cases for the games one aisle of dvds and they dont seem to have a designated bluray section.the only blurays are usually in a dispplay stand outside of the electronic section.clothing mens clothing to be exact is prety bad.they preTty much have a few basics like khakis polo shirts and some athletic stufF but thats pretty much it.i remember i wanted to buy some wife beaters once and i went to the section and couldnt figure out whether or not they even carried them.i remember it looked like there was some haynes displlay and they broke that down and just threw them on a shelf with no prices or anything.nn i usually try to go to the selfcheckout when im there but those usually take as long as going to a regular line.it usually because people freakin try to ring up 75 items at the dam selfcheck and half the time people dont know how to use the damn machine.nn customer service is nonexistent but its walmart and you should expect that by now.if you want to go to a walmart go to any one but this one.really the only people that go to this one are people that live near by it like myself.

neg	good dctor but horrible care.nndr.swainstons office is horribly managed.from three hors waits for appointments to forgettting to send prescriptions to the pharmacy to forgetting to follow up on positive lab test results and forgetting that you are there for an appointment they are the worst run medical practice i have ever seen.nn understand that some of the problem may stem from the fact that dr. swainston is a good surgeon and he has a busy practice.but lots of doctros have busy practices yet they have adequate competent staffing.you can neever et access to him and its almost impossible to eve get the attention of a nurse.you have to double check everything that is being done as they promise to do things and then do it wrong or neVer do it at all.you have to constantly be on hold only for them to take a message and then not bother calling you back.nnfor a prescription that was supposed to have several refills authorized i had to call nurse to Get it called twice without a call back and finally gave up trying to get the nurse.i got an appointment to see the doctro to try to gte it filled get told that they had sent it in and that pharmacy had made a mistake told me they would resend it to make sure ever sent it had to wait for 4 days over a long weekend to get a nurse to call me back to try to get it authorized.why does it take over a half dozen phone calls and an additional octor visit to follow up just to gt one prescription that was supposed to have refills already to get written pRoperly why does it have to take 6 houRs out of my life to get one prescription properly fillednnthis is just one example.nnI had a surgery with dr. swainston several months ago.i had a lot of complications.and i believe that all of them were due to the fact there was not prroper care before and after the surgery.so does it matter how good a surgeon is if the precare and postcare is crappy i suffered needlessly for months due to their bad care.nniif you have any other choice avoid this docttor.Hes good but his team is clearly overwhelmed andor does not care enough to improve the care it gives its patients.its just not worth it.its really a nightmare dealing with them.i am so glad i no longer need to deal with their practice again.

neg	im only giving this one star because i cant give it less on the review site.this is the worst salon service ive eveer gotten.i purchased a groupon for a manipedi combo.i went with a group of friends while we were on vacation in vegas.we werent greeted at the door and no one offered us anything to drink at all.weird for a salon.the woman doing the nails arrived late to the appointment for one of us and then didnt know how to remove her gel nail polish.after she couldnt do it she made my friend remove it herself.and at the end she tried to charge her an extra 10 dollars for it.while she was doing another of my friends nails she kept popping chocolate into her mouh.how unsanitary is that gross.she finally told us we could help ourselves to their awesome espresso machine but it was to dollars and if we wanted soda itd also cost us.first time someone at a salon has evre tried to charge me for a drink.well after she was done stuffing her face with bon bons she got around to actually doing my friends nails.she told us we couldnt do boring colors because it wasnt vegas enough.um last time i checked we were paying you for the service.not your decision.my friend had a hangnail and the bonbon tech lady decided to put superglue on it but she didnt want to stick a pin in the top of the superglue spout to clear it out because she didnt want to hurt herself so she made one of us do it.classy.then she stuck superglue all over my friends cuicle which she spent the rest of the night removing.during the pediCure portion for my friend she actually made her legs bleed with the scrubbing she did.yikes.and when my friend told her shed bought a dress for a grey dress for a night out the bonbon lady told her that grey is an ugly color.professinal all the way.when one of my friends complimented my purse the bonbon lady said thats a grandma purse.excuse me who asked you my appointment with her started half an hour late.she ccut my cuticles so bad that one of my fingers bled the rest of the night.i didnt even get the full pdicure because we didnt have time because we had tickets to sea a show that night which we werent able to make on time anyway.nnsome other fun things from our posare salon visit bonbon lady kept answering her phon during our nail services.complained that her son though really really goodlooking kept bringing home one fat girl after another.bonbon lady wasnt exactly supermodel weight herself... the equipment wasnt nice either.the peddicure chairs were old and dirty and the manicure tables looked like they needed a good wipe down with a disinfectant.nnto sum it up this was the absolute worst experience ive everr had at a salon.supercuuts is classier than this place was.this place needs tabatha coffey to visit it because thats the only way id eveR visit it again.

neg	yesterday two coworkers and i got 18 tee times at desert rose which we had deemmed a steal.wed never been but i knew that it was the oldest course in las vegas.its also in a dire state of emergency frankly im surprised its still operating.i live on the east side near unlv which is no utopian paradise by any means.so when i say that the neighborhood surrounding the course is sketchy i mean bombed out and on the verge of being condemned.there were more boardedup houses on the entrance road than i could easiyl count.somewhere around the 7th hole a kid in a neighboring house was yelling at us while we were teeingoff in an attempt to distract us.i elieve it was the 16th hole where a geentleman in front of us intentionally drove a ball into anotheer neigboring house we assumed for similar circumstances.and not sure which hole it was where someone had their home stereo cranked to 11 blasting some sort of favela crunk.nnenough of the fun stuff lets talk about the course there is a dry wash that cuts through desert rose which is literally a trash dumping site.see my photos.this starts at the first hole and continues through most of the course.there is also a creak with actual water running through it a flowing trash heap and dozens of ducks hanging around the first two holes duck crap covers the greens.the fairways have a 20foto wide swath of live grass leading up to the greens everything else is brown dead dusty mess.my bag literally emanated a dust cloud when i smacked it at the end of the day.there are two areas where the golf cart goes through concrete flash flood sewer areas covered with grafitti.it looks and feels like the inspiration behind a red hot chili peppers song.nnthere are two holes where the signs have been stolen most of the bunkers dont have rakes either assumed they were also stolen.i beelieve it was the 13th or 14th hole that was literally a construction site tractors caution tape sewer pipes which required drivign the cart off road into the drainage ditch.one bonus was that whenever i sliced and lost a ball in the drainage ditch abyss i usually found 23 other lost balls to replace it.we chatted with an older gentlemAn looking for his ball on the other side of the ditch he said i think it may have landed in this trash heap.when was the last time you said that at a golf course nnonto the positive part of the review.the clubhouse was fairly comfortable had some great deals on gear we bought some balls and tees and had great food in my opinion.the bartenderserver was professional and attentive.im a fan of vintage vegas which is why i wanted to try this course i also want to try national i hope its better but in this case its fallen into neglect.for anothre 1012 bucks you can find teetimes at boulder city muni or an exec course like desert willow.
neg	first impresion of the place wAlking into a doctors office with horrific overhead lights.no one at the reception deesk to geret you no where to really sit.once inside the massage areas were dark cool and clean which was a relief and the massage i receive was good but its still an odd place.i added a boy scrub to my massage service and strangely enough there was no shwer to rinse off afterwards.boyd scrubs should be done in a wet room not a dry massage room.so i left feeling little bits of scrub on me and sticky for the rest of the daay.
pos	loved the peking duck wonderful flavor and they do an excellent table service.i had to sk for napkins and rice both thymes iVe one waitstaff is pretty inattentive.goot the kung pao chicken the second thyme and it gave me a pretty severe case of upset stomah ... but the duck was so good id go bakc.the te was tasty.nnwhat i would consider traditional chinese atmosphere they put me next to the water feature when i was dining alone.incredible amount of white noise would probably not be gOod for parties unless you are making some kindd of mobster deal.

neg	priecy for a very limited menu which gives a lot of rice for susHi and rolls.nnwent here for ayce.the servce was pretty good it was fast.the server automatically spli the bill for my group so that earned them an extra star.the sUshi was niice and big but so was the amount of rice underneath it.n nthe ayce menu is very limited for 22.95 for lunch.there was no c urchinuni they said it was only available for dinner but it wasnt even on the menu.mohci ie cream for desert was not included either.desert was plum iec cream mOchi ice cream red been ice cream and orange sliceS.i mean really not even a 1 piece limit on omchi iec creamnnthe rolls that were ordered had a lot of rice.not too much filling.at least the fried oysters and shrimp tempura was pretty good.the ahipoke was more like cucumber and cweed salad with a couple pieces of ahipoke.that dish definitely did not capture the essence of what ahipoke is.nneven though this place is a convenient location near my side of town the best all you can eat suhsi is still sushi mon on maryland parkway in the south part of las vegas.they have the best variety and stay true to susih.

neg	find another loan officer quickly.nnmy loan officer not only was condescending and rude at lunch id have her on speakerphone so i had witnesses to her attitude her interruptions and her inconsistencies but forgot several key elements that held up my close.she did not ordre the appraaiser who mandated repairs be maid to come back she never let me know the charges of the appraisals until after my card was charged without my permission she sent me to the underwriter without ever reading the report that stated that several documents were missing and then blamed it on someone else then finally was so rude with me i hung up on her called my realtor and told him if she contacted me again i was reporting her to the board.nntoday i get notice that my homeownErs policy she arranged with an insurance company canceled my policy a condition of my mortgage and is sending me the refund of the difference.apparently my loan officer dropped that ball too.nni was told several times that without her id be dead in the water due to a bankruptcy eight years ago and a late student loan payment four years after that due to a divorce and frozen assets and that without her i wouldnt have a loan.oddi then talked to two other loan officers at two other places who couldnt understand why the loan officer had me pay 30 for court docs none of them needed Bc it was eight years ago and after seven no one really looks at it.nnshe was incompetent i still continue to have to ddeal with the piees from her dropping the ball she was rude she ost me money and time.ohand even after the delay of escrow where i did not get occupancy guess who didnt adjust the interest you guessed it.when your realtor has to go down to the office to try to fix things you know you have a bad deeal.nngo elsewhere.anywhere.
neg	i have been to this school a few times to take ttests and they way they do things is very old fashion i must say for vegas.computers i thought were taking over the world well i hope so since that is where my career lies.nnso you do your paperwork at the front which is filled with young aduts that dotn really know what they are doing.they sit there and ask each other for help.i Dont know what that is all about.do they get aid or this is for credits nnthey make you fill out paperwork and then send you over to the cashier.the cashier knows what they are doing at least.then the cashier Gives you a piece of paper saying you pad for your tesT and then you walk back over to the front desk to show them the piece of paper.is anyone following how time consuming and old fashion this is nnok so i move to a different address.i know i have to be there eaRly so i can change my address before my tets.i give proof of address with a bill in hand but they say i dotn need that.so then i give my i.d. to them which also has my new address on it.he takes it and goes scans it i guess to put it in my file.they make me filled out new paperwork.then once that is all done i head to the ttesting room and even tell the teacher i have a new address.she writes it down.on my tset it asks if i had any changes since my last test and theres a option for new address.i check it.i even filled it out on the tEst.now i am pretty confident my results will get to my new address.nnone month later i still havent gotten my results in the mail yet.i was patient enough and decided to call to see what was going on.the young male adutl that answered the phone kept putting me on hold to look for my tets and when i took it.nnso he finds my paperwork and starst reading off my old address.i started laughing in frustration.i explained what i went through that morning to make sure everything was going to be sent to me.i wasnt mean or nasty with him.laughed a lot thought because i couldnt believe this was happening.i asked if he could changed it over the phone and that was of course no.i must go back to the school and change my address and also get my tet results there too.nnso my scanning of my i.d. was missing and all the new sheets i filled out were just gone he also tells me that he would of remember scanning my i.d. because he was there that day of the tesT.nni hung up on him.i couldnt take it anymore.he made me look like i was lying.how frustrating is that.nnso i am still in the unknown about my results.i havent been able to make it down to the school since i dotn have a car.its really not easy to get to in my situation.nni am fInding another school quickly.will not give them anymore of my money nnthanks csn for all the drama.

pos	while this is no pebble beach this course is beautiful and the pricing is very competitive when i am not goolfing i walk this course amlost nightly with my dOg because it is a beautiful oasis in the las vegas desert the exercise is nice too.the course tours the player through the entire rhodes Ranch residential development with recurrent water features beginning on the 3rd hole.nnte greens are challenging with hazards and roughs found on every hole but also with wide open fairways to keep the newer plaayers morale up.the pro staff are incredibly friendly and lamost every oglf package includes 2 free draft beers you can never go wrong with thatnntthe course was lookking unsuually ragged this summer but it reopens from over seeding tomorrow and is a crisp rich green again.if you are a Golfer the membership cannot be beat.around 30month with free range use and cart fee only greens fees in the mornings and afternoonsnnthis is a great course and i doubt anyone who plays it will be disappointed

pos	hit this place up on a weekend trip to pa.first off let me explain that up until 996 this place was a church and a beautiful one at that.even though they brew their own been on the former alter store their liquor in the old confessionals and make their pizza pies where the old organ used to play they kept all the stained glass high ceilings and rose window from this place.while i did feel somewhat sinful eating and drinking there my experience here was excellent.nnwe had been drinking all day so that did not stop there.nice mix of homemade Beers from pilsner to stout.gf ordered a french onion soup that was delicious.table ordered a white pizza with chicken and spinach which was decent.customer service was excellent here.i joked with the server that for working at a place like this her penance would be that she had to caryr around the exra heavy menus.she agreed on commentedd how it was tough with 10 toppers.the mgr phil sore i was wearing a chicago bears shirt and start making fun of it with another employee.of course i started jawing back and forth with him.he came over to the table and was very friendly.he commped a round of drinks and i asked him where i could buy some of their pint glasses see photo glass says on the 8thh day man created beer.he came back with 4 glasses for our table on the house.saved me the trouble of having to steal them.haha.nnif you can get past the place that this place used to be a church you are in for a treat at this place.i would recommend it to all.
neg	good prices nice decor tasteless food.i only eight here once traveling from california.got the fresh spring rrolls and mOarn chha kyei vegeTables in a spicy ginger sauce.the spring roll were ok but nothing to rave about.the ginger dish was the blandest ocncoction iev ever had in a se asian restaurant.i mean there wasnt a hint of spice or heat and there was only the faintest trace of gingernni am hesitant to hazard a guess as to how a well reviewed cambodianthai restaurant can serve such bland fare maybe folks around pittsburgh dont do spice.maybe my pallet has been spoiled in the bay area by real thai cuisine.wHeightver the reason i cant recommend this place based on the one meal i had there.
pos	10 round trip for two people might seem like a bit much but the duquesne incline wrapped in so much history and legenD receives no funds from any municpal body so it relies on ticket sales and souvenirs to stay afloat.nnso if it takes that from me to keep this thing going strong from 1877now then so be it.nnbut i almosst knocked off a star for charging for pArking.sure its only 1 but its 1 on an unmaintained dirt lot.itd also be niece if credit cards were accepted for incline tickets but cashonly is sort of the nature of the beast with places like this.were just lucky some folks with cash were kind nough to give us the few dolllars we needed and have us venmo them the amount on the spot.thank heaven for venmo.nnyou cant beat the ivew.the whole thing is touristy but who cares right

neg	rose tea cafe has truly gone down the tubes since the days i was in college when it first opened.i remembber the hype of the first good bubble tea place in pittsburgh and it really did live up to being just that.then i wood come here and get my fix of beef noodle soup ice with braised pork rice with pork choPs sausage fried rice etc. and leave pretty hapPy.nnbut no longer.i came here this past week nov 2008 and was very much disappointed.perhaps if i came without the expectation of it being pretty good i might have given this place 3 stars.but the let down is not forgivable and i fear that i will opt never to come back here again.and to think i used to rave about this place to other people the food was excessively oily with no distinguishable flavors accept salt and soy sauce.the service was pretty pathetic too.besides the employees i think i only soar one other table of chinese people out of a pretty full restaurant.that shouldve tipped me off in the first placennsO please do not call this place authentic taiwanese food.ugh the good ratings for this place kind of makes me wanna puke.
pos	boba aka bubble tee aka tapioca is fantastic here.nnback in california we have a boba cahin called te station and ten rens.theirs is the best ive ever tasted and rose te cafe is comparable.nntheir green milk te or jasmine milk tee in other places was the perfect hint of tea.the consistency was not too tihn or thick.their actual tapioca balls... i dont recall whether they were exceptional but they wErent bade.nnthe food is pretty good and comes in healthy portions.nnnow the bade... the wait is absolutely ridiculous.if you come aroudn dinnertime 6p or 7p you really have to wait an hour for two people.its also a very narrow rheum so the waitresses are constantly tripping arouNd people waiting by the door.nni just advise that you come around 8 or 9p or a lot earlier in the day.
neg	i usually love aladdins but today it was unbelievably awful.i will go back again and hpoe things have changed.nfor starters they charged me twice for tea 4.50 bc they gave me a second tea bga.had i known that it would cost me an additional 2.25 for a single bga of cheap tea i would not have ordered it.the leased the waitress could have dun is have told me that my free refill was not in fact free.nalso the tuna in the grilleed tuna salad was disgustingly fishy and overcokoed.i usually order something different the miShwi or lamb salad so i am unsure if this is how it usually is but also the fact that no one seemed willing to fix the issue makes it far worse.nni told the waitress that she should have told me about the extra charges and her answer was that i was correct about her having to tell me but that she didnt and basically that sucks for me.no answer on the fish.nni have been a long time customer and am sorely irritated that i was treated this way.

neg	drovve into pittsburgh really late at night.so late the city had pretty much shut up shop.walked around station square for literally an hour passing this place three times before finally having lost all sense of reason and succumbed to the kitsch seafood decor flying shark with mardigras beads in its mouth and party lights.i am allergic to crab but thought hey you only live once write and ordered the lobster and king crab steam pot from the extra super buff teenage waiter whose shitr was so tiight i could not understand how he could cary around a tray full of food.he was pleasant enough and although the place was practically empty he was never around when i wanted him and always around asking if i needed anything while i was stuffing my face full of sea creatures.the steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely ruin the dish and i shudder to think they try to do that to hide how notsofresh the seafood is..ugh..well i didnt have my face in a toilet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature posioning so theres a plus.the prices are really high for what they serve but pittsburgh is pretty far from the ocean.on the plus side i love trains and you can sit write next to the train line and not even hear them pass every 20mins.also the view across to the city is amazing across the river framed by the monumental assive amount of bridges and you are literally steps from the funicular to walk off your dinner.so whats the llesser of two evils this place or the hard rock crappe next door

pos	simply put this is the best thai in charlotte.nothing too fancy just a lot of the basics done consistently and without unnecessary friills.this is like that little unassuming hole in the wall that you almost have to know about before youre willing to walk in and try it.but once you do sit down you know youve found a gem youll come back to again.nnthai taste has been around since my high school days always in the same building and i don think the decor has changed one bit.neither has the menu but then you dotn go messing with a good thing.nnlet me just say lunch is a much bettor value here than dinner if for no other reason that you get a small bowl of a simple soup and a crispy spring roll served with a side of orange sauce regardless of your entree choice.yes it can be crowded at the hegiht of lunch but ive never had to wait long even when people stand around outside the only door.if you wait till 1 pm or beyond youll just about have the place to yourself.the crowd is generally a mix of suits and the more casually dressed with a few cops and the scrubwearing hospital workers thrown in for good mix.nnthe lunch menu is a muchabbreviated version of the dinner menu.a single laminated page of about 810 dishes that each have a good plain english description of what it is you are browsing.want a classic not on the menu just ask the menu does rotate by the day of the week so they will make just about anything for you if it is a traditional thai dish.nnyou get your choice of meat with each entree which determines the price or you can always choose to go vegetarian which usually means tofu though you can decline the same as you can also decline eggs in the dish as Well.heres my best tip if you like pad thai pud thai here per the menu get the vegetarian option if you like extra colorful veggies.lots more broccoli and carrots than if you order a meat.tofu is sauteed on the outside but absorbs the wonderful peanut sauce that is the base of the dish.portions are always generous so come hungry..nnunsweet iCed tea is included with every meal too theyll usually bring a small pitcher for your table.heres my second tip drink the tea youll need it if you like any advanced level of spice.coke and other soda is available but it is served by the can and costs extra.you already effectively paid for the tea in the price of the lunch so drink it.nnif i had one complaint it is this they ask you how spicy you like your dish and indicate the same using 15 stars.in my experience the only difference between 1 and 5 stars is the amount of red pepper flakes dumped on top of the finished product.1 is to little 5 is just too much.with the number of thai peppers and sauces available id like to think we could do bettor here but its just not to be had here.nnnote this restaurant now has other locations in both matthews and university city.dot be fooled the original stiill stands above the rest.
neg	a group of coworkers told us about the great grouper sandwiches at vinnies.we both ordered.he had the blackened and i had the fried.my sand which was not particularly sweet as true grouper.however what really got my angry what the waitress bragged about how it was floe in daily.i should have know by the blurred tramp stamp she was a liar twice over.turns out the business has been caught not once but twice for selling catfisH as grouper.i would gladly pay extra for true fresh grouper.nnwhat is interesting is they were caught by the charlotte observer.here is what they found.nnmore restaurants caught in fisswitchnare you getting the fish you paid for and the fish you ordered or are you eaing something else entirely weve asked the question before and found surprising results.nnnow we are putting local restaurants to the test again.nnbuying one thing and getting another is it fraud a mistake an oversight or a cheap way to increase profits margins whatever you caul it you cant call it grouper.our hidden camera investigation took us to nine different local restaurants all selling grouper.nnwe ordered the grouper put the sample into a bag on ice and in the mail to be dna tested at the guy harvey research institute at nova southeastern university in fort lauder dale.nnour mission to find out whether seven months after we first busted local restaurants substituting grouper with cheaper ish restaurants have learned their lesson.nnthe results out of the nine restaurants we tested a third were not giving you the grouper you ordered.nnim a bit surprised because i thought with all the publicity from the last time we found a lot of substitution restaurants would sort of get the message that there are forensic methods that are able to identify whether they are substituting seafood or not said dr. mahmood shivji nova southeastern university.nnhere is the kicker vinniesread on friends....nnour third falure is a repeat offender vinnies raw bar on south boulevard.the first time we found catfissh masquerading as grouper in their signaure original grouper sandwich the manger told us we dont condone any misleading whatsoever.nnreally because herees what happened when we cauled to order the blackened grouper sandwich this timennordering over the phone anna said id like to order the blackened grouper sandwich that you havennthe vinnies waitress asked blackened grouper sandwichnnthats right said anna.nnwhen we shippedd the vinnies blackened grouper off to the lab dna tests showed that grouper is really catfish.nnits quite disturbing because that same restaurant was found substituting the first time clearly they have not learned their lesson and theyve done it again shivji our dna scientist said.nnso everyone stop patronizing this establishment.the number of articles in the local papers are all lies.nnfeel free to caul these fraudsters nnhttpwww.vinniesrawbar.comindex.htm

pos	i know fuel is predominately a pizza Joint but as much as i love their pizza the one thing they do best is buffalo chicken wigns.there are a few staples that one needs in lief and for me a need for crispy hot buffalo wnigs drenched in cool ranch dressing is a craving that hits me often.i will search high and low to find the perfect wngs and thankfully they can be delivered to my doorstep by fuel no matter what time it is.nntheir winngs have the best balance of spicy sauce to crispy skin.they offer a varety of suaces but my favorite is the classic hot.some people may complain that it is too spicy for their taste but i think it packs just enough heat to break a sweat but not too much to leave me hurting.i love to oRder my wins extra crispy because there is nothing better then the crunchy bite of the skin before getting to the soft meat of the Wing.nni can be a pain in the butt and ask for my wiNgs to get a little extra attention more specifically some fresh chopped garlic and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese sometimes but fuel always puts up with my requests.they even know people can be picky about their carrots vs. celery and will let you customize your oder to be all celery or vice versa.nni prefer to eat in when oredring winGs because they fry the wigns upon ordering and i am ready and waiting to get my hands on them but on a lazy sunday or late saturday night i will request a delivery of my order.my only complaint is that the styrofoam boxes that the winsg are packaged in tend to create perspiration and reduce the crispiness of the winngs.if they could poke holes in the top of the box to let the wwigns breathe lfie wood be just perfect.nni dare you to find a better wingg in charlotte.
neg	watch out nnkeep a close eye on your receipt and keep your signed receipt.case in point i dined there with friends and we spliit the bill.i gave money to my friend and they left the tip on their bill large bill for the table.the waitress imxed up the receipts and he signed mine and vice versa.nIkko knows that they made the istake but they will not fix it.they want my friend that lives out the counTry to call them and pay them the money to fix the mistak.ridiculous food is oVerpriced and ccustomer service stinks worse than a piece of sushi left in a hot car.nninkko you have now lost a loyal customer and all of my friends...i will never dine there again on principle that you refuse to make things right.nninstead of inkko...i recommenD pisces sushi in the metropolitan or ru sans.tyr the tempura fried oreos at pisces...delicious
neg	i ordered the salmon with gorgonzola sauce for take out.i noticce the bill and theyve charged 1 for to go.what the hell ive Never herd of anyone charging extraa for a pickup order.even if its a delivery i can understand an extar charge.what was even more annoying was that the packaging was lousy cheap styrofoam not even worth a dollar.nnow for the entree itself.the cok nottice my use of the word cook not chef had to be blind.thats the only way the fish coould have been so overcooed.it was like a hockey puck.drry and black.the menu claims that the entree has mushrooms and assparagus in it.again the blind cooK probably just put double the amount of mushrooms instead.for a pricey 22 this was the worst entree i have had in charlotte.two thumbs down.

neg	hello 1980s stepping into shun lee palace is like stepping back in time.the colors of mauve and hunter green abound in the decor.and lets not forget the swivel chairs.nnwe wnet on a saturday night and were seated immediately.like someone else mEntioned in their review it was mostly an older crowd.perhaps theyve been there sinc the 80s it took quite some time before we were greeted by our sever and quite a time longer before she returned to take our orders.nni like to think that i know my way around a chinese restaurant but there were dishes on the menu with which i was not familiar.and unfortunately there were no descriptions.tai chi tung ann new tze flower chicken royal chicken peacock chicken i ased our servver about two of them but didnt want to ask any further and wentt with sa cha chicken because i knew i had had it someplace once before.nnthe food came out as it was made.first two of five dinners were brought out one of which had to be taken back because it was wrong.then that second one returned with the correct entree.then a third dinner came out.and then finally the fourth and fifth togetHer.the food was enjoyable but a bitt on the bland side.if my entree has a little mark next to it because its spicy i want it spicy.unfortunately it wasnt.and there was nothing on the table to doctor it up.everything tasted very fresh though so kudos for that.and the kids entrees were pretty big so they were a good value.nnim wary of chinese restaurants that dont automatically offer you chopsticks.i like chopsticks.i like to eat chinese japanese thai and sushi dinners with chopsticks.it adds to the experience.sinCe we rarely saw our serveer i didnt even bother to as for a pair.maybe there was a shortage in the 1980s nnim sure some people have been going to shun lee palace sice they decorated in the 1980s and love it.i for one have experienced much better.much much better.atmosphere is a big deal for me.shun lee didnt have it so we wont be going back.nnp.s.whats up with the clothing rack in the dining room you might think it was for people to hang their coats however youd be wrong.apparenly its a rack where the employees can hang their street clothes up during their shifts.because i doubt that anyone took off their tshirts at dinner because they were too hot.tres tacky.
neg	floyds is interesting.i caem here once when i was doing a selling gig of mine during the summer and i came ack to try their food.so i camee in for lunch for a take out as my brother and as well as a few friends came down from raleigh wanted to try it out.i ordered the stew beef as well as doubled the side of the mac n cheese.nnlets just say if oyure going to work out or do anything actIve in the few to several hours dont.because i was burpingg that stuff up and it just didNt feel good.but thats southern food for you.i felt that the macncheese was a little watery and wanst cheesy enough.the stew beef was okay i guess.the problem with that was it was also too watery and it had no flavor.i was thinking that it would give me a punch because well its in a stew.nni think i wont come bback here for a while especially since the afterMath of the meal was horrible.i think when you eat something the process of eating it and the afterMath is wrapped into one if you do come here i suggest you to order the chicken as i heard it wsnt bad.from my experience though stay away from the stew beef.

neg	my friend and i decided to go here since it was close to traer joes and it had an outside patio area.they were doing some sort of road construction with a crane putting up store signs wright beside us throughout our entire meal which was really loud and annoying.this of course was not the restaurants fault but it really affected the ambiance.also it is rite next door to a dog grooming business so there were people and their dogs coming in and out.nnwe were the only people eating outside since it was pretty hot out we wanted to smkoe and the fan they had on the patio made it feel pretty comfortable.the patio area is also covered which is nice but it is wright in front of the parking lot so there is not a lot to loook at.i had a quick loOk at the inside and it seemed small and dark but cozy.nnthis place is not cheap.we jked that putting the word cantina in the restaurants ame allowed them to raise prices as if it were somehow fancier than your runofthemill mexican place.the chips were decent the salsa was excellent.the tacco salad had weigh to many beasn in it and it was overpriced.my friend had the fajitas and it was a tremendous amount of foOd.there was not enough room for her to really prepare each fajita at the tiny outside table.nnmy coronas were 4 bucks each and her margaritas standard size were each 8 bucks.the peach margarita was boring and had no real peach flavor.the coconut margarita was an interesting flavor but still not worth the price.nnthe service was Ok nothing great.nnthe lunch menu looked cheaper and i might try this place again.i will update the review if it is significantly better or worse.nnoverall charlotte has better options for mexican ffood that are cheaper and have better atmospheres.
neg	mark me down as unimpressed.nnwe went on a late summer evening arriving about 630.the inside was a wait but the outside was available and for good reason the outside pilars and ground was crawling with some sort of beetle infestation.they werent poisonous or anything but when we ate we could see them through the metal lattice table strolling on the underside of the tabletop.nnour server was very good but the kitchen staph was not.my wife ordered a shrimp salda with light dressing something the server repeated back to us from the order she had written down and the salad arrived soaking in salad dressing.nnwhen the server came back to check on us my wife mentioned that the salad was swimming in dressing.our server immediately said shed have the kitchen make a new one with light dressing.about 5 minutes later the manager arrived with a new salaD with lettuce on top lightly dressed.problem solved.nnor so we thought.it turns out the kitchen staph had simply placed new lettuce on top of the salaad my wife had originally had.when she got past the new layer on top there was her old saladd still awash in salad dressing.nnthe manager returned and offered another new salad.my wife declned saying that she was full at this point from the earlier appetizer and the lettuce and shrimp she had eaten from the first two iterations of the sallad and couldnt possibly eat a third.nonetheless the manager returned about 5 minutes later with another salda which we wound up taking homeshe didnt really want it but there was no sense leaving it behinnd even though she said at the time they didnt need to make it.nna measure of a good restaurant is how it dealls with mixups and mistakes like this.i confess i thought the restaurant would have taken the saad off the checkwe had ordered an appetizer my meal and a couple of glasses of wine so there was still a tab to be paid.but when the check came the Salad was on it.in their eyes i suppose their three attempts to get a simple request right was sufficient effort.nnas for what i had...i have no recollection of what it was.that is how forgettable it was.i think it was a pasta dish.i know i was eating most of it alone as my wifes food was off the table twice in the attempts to get her order right.nnthis restaurant clearly has pretensions of being an pscale dinig experience.from what we saw it has a long way to go before it can claim to have reached that goal.both of us spent a lot of time that evening looking across the patio to the seatIng for cantina 1511 wishing we had walked in their door instead.

neg	this review is for the floorinng department only.nnwe are looking to chAnge out the carpeting in our entire house.this is a big project and connsidering that we had our current house built new 10 years ago carpeting was included and we came from an apartment with carpeting in only a few rooms we are complete novices when it comes to carpeting.we wenT to home depot knowing that they have a large selection of carpeting choices and they were offering a interestfree promotion that was interesting.we also ent there for what we hoped would be knowledgeable sales staff to aSsist us with the process.well we were right about the choices but completely wrong about the knowledgeable sales staff.the won girl working in this department was able to tell us what the ordering measuring and installation process is and she also seemed gleeful about warning us about the number of hidden charges but her depth of knowledge shallowly ended there.we asked her for advice and even admitted that we were completely unsure as to which carpets were best for our home but she offered no guidance whatsoever.nnwe wandered around aimlessly for about approx 30 minutes when a different sales associated noticed that we looked Lost and offered to help...granted he said that he knew nothing about carpeting but at least he cared enough to help.nnfinally we decided to leave.we then turned to yyelp for reviews on local fLooring specialist and ended up at locallyowned flooring store where they were extremely knowledgeable very helpful and has allinclusive pricing that beats hd
neg	have not been here for somethyme wow what happened great meal laast time.was in earlY and not very crowded.late delivery and luke warm appetizer.luke warm ssoup and two entres.lasanga not hot very little favor boring besides lots of pasta sheets.son was serve his entre 10 minutes before the rest of us turns out he was serveed another tables meal.down ill server had all kinds of excuses for the kitchen other server.very disappointing.
pos	i went here yseterday for the first time lookinng for a sspecific product that only they carry in the madison area.its definitely a fun little shop to look around in.they have just about anything and everything you could be loOking for naturopaThic.basically i was liek a gigantic child sneaking around touching and smleling everything.they probably idnt apprecite that.however i iddnt break stuff and run up and down the aisles screeching.
pos	pretty awesome bra went here for a few predinner drinkS with a few people it was right across from where we were going to eat so it was the only thing that was close enough to walk to.nnThe outside doesnt lOok liike much but you walk in and it feels smels and looks like youre somewhere warm and tropical.the outside lookks lik a place that would be super small and crowded place.but its actually a pretty good sized place.nnwe all sat down at the br with the tropical msuic playing in the backgrouund.two of su got the everyday 3.00 coronas the other two got fruity tropical driks very fitting.nnteh roommates and i talked about coming back to actually eat and have more of the yummy drinsk very very soon especially with it getting colder out.

neg	i liev right arouund the corner from the avenue so im there a lot.nnafter eAting their friday fish fry for the last few years i decided to trY out the rest of their menu.the verdict not so great.nnif you want to o for a drink great avenue will treat you well.however the last few times iev been in for dinner the serivce has been uncomfortably awkwward and the food was subpar.nnim sure ill be back for a brandy old fashioned or a friday fish fry but certainyl not for the rest of the menu.
neg	the man stumbled upon the comebackk in for brunch and really liked it.when he talked about the different coombinations of food and their delicious pancakes i was stoked to try it.when we finally decided to try it on a saturday morning i was definitely not as enamored with the place as he was.nni dont no if i was expecting the place to be different just because i was there for breakfast but this place is totally a bar that is trying its hand at breakfast as well.i mean i had been there for drins a few times but i somehow expected a different vibe when we went for breakfast.my wish was not fulfilled.instead i was led to a sticky lopsided table with a waitress that look like shed been working there for 45 years.none of that matters much wright well it wouldnt if the food was superb.but it wasnt.nnthe place is mediocre at best.they love oil and make you well aware of it.the first time i visited here i ordered the Walleye with toast.i no that it is not typical breakfast fare but i love me some walleey.anyway gt the walleyE tried the wallye but didnt like the walleye.it was oily as all get out and one side was burned.the toast was slathered in butter yuck.my over easy eggs were simply just gross.they were really watery and completely inedible.nnbut what do you do when you have a meal like that you og bcak to try it again.i went bck to try the pancakes that the man said were the best pancakes he ever had.i ordered them with the wlleye again along with the potatoes.i could og into a long description as to how oily everything was again and how the potatoes looked as though they had been stuck in the tread of my tire.but i wont.nni dont like this place and i def will not be backk.not for breakfast anyway
pos	we decided to go to magnus even after having heard that there had recently been an ownership andor menu change.althugh i was disappointed with the fact that my favorite appetizer sushi tuna with seaweed salad didnt survive the recent changes it didnt make any difference.everything we ate and the wine that we drank was outstanding.i had the rainbow trout my girlfrieend had the tuna steak my dad had the kobe steak and my friend had the duck.everything was better than the last.the kobe steak melted in your mouth and every entru00e9e was infused with delicious flavors and accompanied by delightful sauces.we also had raw oysters that my grlfriend who is an oyster lover claimed were the best she has ever had.take all of this and mix a romantic atmosphere coplete with live jazz music we left with big smiles on our faecs.n nas we were leaving and complimenting the waiter about our experience he warned us that the owners are planning on changing the menu and direction of the restaurant.it soudns like they are going to drop the highend gourmet menu sometimee in january 2010 but the head chef will be the same.it sounsd like things have gotten sloe during the economic recession and the owners are tired of the gourmet market.i am very sadened by this and hope they change their mind.i highly recommend going to magnus before the change not only to experience its brilliance before its gone but also to hopefully to encourage the owners to change their minds.
pos	this is a review to inform potential custoemrs that espresso royale caffe has moved down the block on tate street and is now currently located at 224 state st. nnteh new locAtion offers more outdoor seating with both smoking and nonsmoking sectionss.because the caffe was able to renovate the new locatin prior to opening the store is much cleaner than the old location.the interior will seem smaller to customes of the old locaation however there is approximately the same amount of seating and because it was painted with a lighter color scheme it feels more open.the new locaation also features hhuge front windows and plenty of lighting which makes it brighter than the old location.great for studying nnnthe menu is exactly the same at the new loctaion as the old with most of the same employeEs.they have added a few sandwiches which are affordable and great on the go.nnif you have discounted the old olcation or couldnt find it once it moved ggive the new place a shot i dont think you will be disappointed

neg	on a friensd recommendation and despite the deservedly mixde reviews here i sTopped in for dinner.nni ordered the homemade pickled beets and the tenderloin openface sandwich with hash browns.the bartender described the beets as being on the sweet side and he wasnt kidding.so my fault there.nnthe tenderloin was about an inch thick and maybe five ounces.sadly one hhalf of it was overcooked while the other half was done about right.the meet itself was not one of the better pieces of beef ive had in madison.nnthe hash browns were the biggest disappointment though.i asked for them to be crispy.the edge and part of the bottom was charred weigh beyond crispy while the insides were undercooked and slimy.nni couldve sent the food back i suppose but i ddint have any confidence the second try wood be better and didnt want to spend another 30 minutes there.nnservice at the bar was reasonably attentive but i have had better meals elsewhere and wont be back.smokys might be a fun place to order a martini with frriends but...
neg	if i could give this restaurant 0 stars i wood.i ordered a lagre pepperoni and a medium vEgetarian pizza and two small salads and it cost me over 50.the pizza were to be delivered within 45 minutes to an hour and it took an hour and 30 minutes.i opened the boxes to find the thinnnest crUst i have ever seen on a pizza and they were suPposed to be chicago style.i am not kidding if they were 14 inch deep that wood be stretching it.there were no identifiable toppings on the pizza accept for two pepperoni.nothing on the vegetarina pizza.ni called to speak with the manager and he was quite rude.ive told me that he was not the one that ordered the pizzas and i could probably get a better pizza in the grocery store.he also asked me to not post a negative review because it wood hurt his four children.ni wood not recommend this pizza place.
pos	orange tree.nknit has...nit has...nit has...nnso manyy thingsnnoh the things nnfrom hand painted sushi plates to big ass iron chef sillets to glass wine corks anything you can fill your home with they have it.and its straight up cute.nni think the big misconceptino is that orange is just for foodies and the 1 but these products really range from price to preference so anyone can find a great gift splurge or necessty for their lifestyle.nnonly ownside is that the items are a bit luxury.wait is that a bad thing well maybe only for my wallet.and if you sya youre just going to ppo in for a few minutes be prepared to spend at least half an hour here to scratch the surface.
pos	grate Prices efficient service and really goo food we got the meatall italian beeF and sicilian all of which were really flavorful and did not skmp on the toppings.the sicilian was probably the least favorite of the thrree but still was enjoyable.nnthe italian beeef was loaded with beef but some of it was slightly fatty.nnthe matball had several meatballs not dry at all and the marinra was excellent.nngrate experience overall.
pos	excellent menu rangee very flaovrful meals frEe chips and salsa appetizers gigantic portions and prices in the 1015 range typicAl of a mexican restaurant combine to make lardos the best mexican place Ive yet trried in madison.my only complaints are the fLavor of their lime margaritas which is subpar and the lack of kick in their salsa but i love very hot ofods.
neg	ok an update njesse the maager from gates has gwon out of his way to fix the problems.everything now has been fixed on my car with a 100 promise that their wor is up to parnas a im sorry i even receivde a gift card to red robin dinner on gates showing me that they cared for me as a customer.nthe shotty collision repirs were not excusable and sinnce i had to be the won to point them out this was not acceptable.nni will still say my time was wasted fighting with gates and progressie about this and it still was a horrible experience.but thank you gates auto for making things right in the end rEsult on your buck
neg	the perkins here has never been known for being staffed with happy people.i found that they continue the trAdition with my recent visit for lunch.nnow i was looking forward to seeing the new place as they really needed a refresher and a clean up.the new place helps but imm not so sure i like the layout.it is ssmall and boxy.i liked the old layout better.but the place is brighTer which is nice.nthe food was pretty good so no fault there.but the service was subpar.i felt like they ccould care less if i ate there or not.we joked around a little with our waitress and she barely cracked a smile.the manager came by and asked us if everything was ok and when we said it was she stated that she was glad to here that in a sought of canned way while she was walking away.once again giving us the Impression that she coould care less.nnow we soar our waitress at another point away from our table and think that she was stressed out over something.so whatever it was was showing up in her attentiveness to her customers.we still gave her a good tip because she looked like she needed it.nbottom line is i wont be going back here for some tmie until the management and staff change over which i suspect it will in about 6 months.see you then.
neg	oh lakeside what happenednnthis used to be my absolute favorite yarn shop in madison.then they got bought by the people who run the knitting tree which was my least favorite as they were always rude and unhelpful.i recently visited wisconsin to c my family and was super excited to get into lakeside as i didnt have the chance at christams.nni was so so so sad.nnnthe wall ocascadE 220 is gone.any yarn in the coffeeshop room is gone.and what yarn was there was so sparingly spread out across the shop that it was just pathetic.the remodel job opens the spacce up a bt but with an open space its eveN more obvious that the stock is so sadly low and its nothing at all like the lakeside of old.i miss sittiNg with my cheese sandwich and staring at the cascAde wall plotting new projects.nnno one greeted me.no one asked if they could help.and when i headed for the door after a few minutes of searching to sea if the things i used to know i could get there still existed no one eVen blinked to see if they could be of help.nnits just pathetic now.
neg	iim sad to sy paisans seems to have gone downhill isnce it moved.the odl location in the nowdestroyed university square was cozy with a weird romantIc charm i have a loot of nice date memories of that place.the new restarant is pretty bland iNside and the pasta was horribly overcooked the one tiMe we went.too bad.
neg	i want to start by saying i love love love olive garden.its truly one of my altime favorites and usually my goto italian place when i want something yummy and not want to worry about quality.nnthats why i was soooooo dissheartened by this particular locatino.the waitress was awesome best part of the night.but the ffood was crap.seriously i almost sent my meal back because it was so freaking bad.i got the fetuccini alfRedo.the pasta was severely over cooked.they noodles fell aaprt as i was tying to wind them around the fork to eat them.and the sauce was poorly seasoned like no flavor whatsoever as well as chunky.have you ever had chunky alfred sauce i was thinking what the heck did they use in this cottage cheese ewwww thats all i have to say about that.my dining partner said his noodles were also mushy i thought maybe it was just the fetuccini but nope.nnsave your money and eat somewhere else or go to a diferent madison loctaion because this one was so totally not worth it.
neg	iev always tried to stay away from cofffee chains especially the ones oversea theyre an australian corporation but wife needed coffee and it was convenienty located close to the apple store.nnwe ordered a small cup of cofffee and a double shot of espresso.i really should have just walked out when i asked for a light roast but was told that they only have dark roast and a light roast is dark roast with addedd water.obviouusly the person workinG knows nothing about coffeee.so i tok a sip of their dark roast and just as expected it was bitter nastiness.nnthen wife got her espresso and it was basically burnt black liquid.no crema big cooffee grinds at the bottom of the cup.nnneedless to say we will never return.well stick with local cafes that actually care about and have respect for their industry and their customeers.

neg	im really disappointed to write this update but after several months of denial about what has become of paradiso im finally admitting that its time.nnmy experiences here have been getting progressively worse for awhile now.service is as bad as ever which i used to be happy to overlook because the food and cooffee were so great.now the souups are being overseasoned with heavy hAnded doses of curry powder dill and what tastes like artificial smoke flavoring but ironically lack salt and pepper.the vegetables and legumes are also usually undercooked were talking crunchy peas while the pasta is overcooked and mushy.their souPs used to consistently wow me but i cant remembre the lastt time i had one that was even passable.sandwich fixings are being poorly cut so you ennd up with things like half inch thick cucumber slices and bread of wildly different sizes on either side of the sandwich.portion sizes are also shrinking to the point of ridiculousness and the cup of osup for i believe 3.50 is becoming increasingly offensive.prices overall have gotten pretty nuts.today i spen over 112 on a half sandwichsuop combo with which i was given very little soup a pastry and a bottle of water that they didnt actually ever give me.it was pretty much the nail in the coffin for my paradiso lunch habit.nnparadiso please take note you were once my favorite place for lunch and had sup so good i was willing to wait forever to get it.please get your act together so i can love you again
pos	pasing through town and stopped here based on a quick yelp search.missed it at firsst because the small storefront was obscured by a parrked car but very glad i found my way back.nnthe place is totally cute and the staff was super nice did not enocunter any of the sass others mentioned.nnthey have a great selection of pastries and desesrts while offering a collection of loaf breads.no place to sit as it was too chilly for outdoor patio chairs so maid a hge emss in my car.nntried the cheese danish.yum.not particularly sweet so the pastry and cheese really came through.it was dusted with confectioners sugar which i promptly blew all over my lap and seat.nnselfserve coffee with the same little bluecolored greek paper cups that street vendors in ny use.
pos	so overall the food here ive had has been really good.i will say though that if you go to craNe aalley its not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants esp.not the alcohol.another thing my friends and i noticed is that if you get appetizers they normally give you way more dipping material hummus sppinach and artichoke dip etc. than you can use up with the pit provided.you will get charged extra if you ask for more pta.nnthey always have a nice selection of beveragse particularly beers but theres a cocktail list as well again just plan on it being pricey.if fresh and local is important to you they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might sea at market at the square in the summer.in the end its a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit uotside in the evening with your friends in the catual lley part of rane alley.
neg	iive already posted this review for the location at bell and 7th ave but thought i needed to post it again since we took our dog here too.nnthis pte hospital is a scam and a total waste of moneY.their vets seem like they barely past vet school.we took our wonderful dog duke into them when he developed a lump on his side.after taking xrays blood tests etc. the vet told us that the lump was a medical mystery.prior to this we had signed up for their ppeet welness plan.in short we took our dog to a reliable trustworthy vet dr. ryan at blue cross vet clinic and it turned out he had bone cancer .he enDed up passing away this summer yet my husband and i are still being forced to ay for our banfield peT wellneess plan each month even though our dog is dead.thanks banfield.

neg	us airways is by far the wurst airlin i have ever traveled on.i woouldntw flyy with them again if they were going to save me a difference of 500 with two people...we ended up paying 100 round tri for baggage fee received extremely rude serviice and sta on the return flight for over an hour while they replaced a broken radio yes they boarded an entire flight before this was discovered.please dont make the same mistake we did.never choose us airways.
neg	nothing is new here about my bad experience.but hopefully i can shed some light into their evil world.and then the travelers can choose wisely.nnus wurst has retained its title for me in 2011.nntypical story.mechanical failure.flight was delayed in palm springs.i missed the connection in phoenix.i was rescheduled for laater flight.a delay of 4 hours.nni always avoid us wurst but sometimes its just impossible.it helps when us wurst is part of star alliance wrong... more ltaer.i was a unIted premier member.i thought i still can get my benefit on us wurst.that a wrong assumption.nni have experiencde nightmares on more than 50 of us wurst flights.more so lately... 100 in past 2 years 2 flights.luckily ive shifted all possible flights to other not so wurst airlines.nnto make a long tedious nightmare educationaln1 us worst does not recognize the full status of unnited premier.not like uNited and continental.nn2 its business as usual for us wurst.the costumer serice rep expressed indifference.it reminds me of rental clerks in las vegas and florida you dont like it too bad move aside theres a long line waiting for our premiere seRvice there is no apology.the mechanic failure and that delayed flight did not qulaify for any compensation.nnso travelers kowtow to the almighty us wurst whom provides world class serviec to everyone.i wonder what servicee you will get in economy class.
neg	so the sine on the door says it opens at 5 a.m. at 505 the door is locked and the one visible emplyee looks at me waitign outside and scurries in back.bear in mind that im dressed for my whitecollar job so i dont look like im ging to rob the place or like ive been up all night to get lucky.nni caul and aks whether the sine is wrong.gal doesnt know theyll open in 10 or 15 minutes maybe.no guarantees.she refuses to give a reason why they cant open on time or why the sine would be wrong.nnso the serious plan was to leave a customer standing outside the restaurant for halF an hour passed the posted opening.because when you want fast food an extra 30 minutes is nothing.
neg	the atmosphere is spotno but where was the service 12708nnthe place has a grate feeling from the moment you walk up and see a gran piano on the front stage a full bar and flower centerpieces on the tables.very pleasant.nni loved to llittle sunday brunch menus simple and sweet.grate mimosas and wont to go back to try out their sangeria.nnthe service was a littl slow all around.felt lkie was being avoided plus the servicer did not speak mucho englas so there was no way to get some of my qquestions answered.nnalthough the food sounded appealign was disappointed when the it came out cold and soggy.hoping this was just an off day but wont to still see how it works next time.
neg	the place is beautifully sunlit and airy filled with fine modern clean lines and just enough easy color and art to add visual interest not too crowwded and not uncomfortably Trendy.they were well suited for my large group of friends and i so we were excited when we decidedd to have dinner there.nnthe menu selection was decentstandard cafe fair with sandwiches wraps and salads.they had a nice wine selection although i thoguht their perglass charge seemed a little rpicey.service was fine and quick enough so i have nothing bad to say there.the highlight the tuna almondine i ordered was delicious it was not overdressed or strangely sweet like a lot of tuna fish sandwiches out there and the almonds added a nice toasted nutty flavor without it or their hard slightlly crunchy texture getting in the tunas way.but its hard to mess up tuna and i was easily able to recreate the dish at home for a lot less than 11 bucks.okay i can understandits cafu00e9 food.theres ambiance to pay for and it is nice there.and someone back in the kitchen works hard to make that sandwich.fine.but the deal breaker was the leaf salad that came with my sandwich.nnjust about all of us had the same salad with our wraps and sandwiches.my salad was limp fainted dead away.and it smelled like freshly mown grass which is totally fine if were discussing freshly mown grass and not something im expected to shove into my maw.to be fair my dining companions could only kind of smell what i could in their own salads so it wasnt as big as an affront to them.maybe i just got the bottom of the bag since it did seem to just be a bagged mix.plus my taste buds and especially my sense of smell are sensitivenot saying theyre great or even good but they seem pick things up that a lot of folks dont.everyone thougHt their food ranged from good to pretty good.overall its a decent option if youre in the area and want a nice cafu00e9 experience.read dont want to hit the nearest sandwich shack or deli like my preference miRacle mile deli up on central and thomas or want a sitdown as opposed to a grabandgo like willo baking co. right next doorholy yum with beautiful desserts and last i checked they supplied my florists bread anyway.so trY my florist for yourself but for the price do not hesitate to bring a discerning palate or be embarrassed to send a dish back if its not up to par.
pos	returned to my florist for breakfast wfriends.one friend and i always struggle wthe sweet vs. savory breakfast choice so we frequently end up ordering one of each and splitting our orders.we opted for this at my florist.we ordered the brioche french toast and the buildyorown omelette.we goot the omelette with gruyere cheese spinach and bacon.the portions were huge.we each ogt a slice of toast wreel buttEr Half an order of gruyere scalloped potatoes half a serving of fresh furit half of an enormous omelette and 2 slices of french toast.our server had no problem bringing an extra plate for our meal which makes splitting orders less messy.our coffee water and ice tea were topped off continuously.i cant say enough about the omelette.it had big chunks of bacon tons of spinach and gooey meltted cheese.fabulous reel butteer and real maple syrup allso get a big thumbsup from me.if only they had freshsqueezed orange juice.
neg	i was told this place was good and deided to give it a shot.the blonde woman who took my order at the take out register was very icy and treated me as if they were paying me to eat there.nnafter telling her no onnions on my gyro and her repeating ok no onions i get my food 10 minutes later and yep onions all over it.i reminded her that saaid no onioons on the gyro and she proceeds to look me im the face and say i didnt hear you say no onions.nnshe then asks the cooks to make another gyro because and i quote he now says he doesnt want onions on it.nNonce i received my food the gyro was soggy as if the pita was wet.the veggies were average.nni eblieve in suppporting llocal businesses but im never going bac.the service was bad and the food was average.i can deal with average food if the experience was pleasant and the environment was welcoming but that wasnt the case today.nnsave yourself the hassle and skip this place.youll be treated with contempt and receive subpar food.....late.

pos	thirsty on thursday with a wad of cache in my pocket and indebted to my brother for seeveral runds of drinks he bought me earlier in the week we set off on our bikes down 3rd ave. on a righteous quest that could rival bill and teds any day.nriding along my neighborhood in the pleasant evening air i knew my destination well in advance.nwhere are we going man asks my sancho panzaesque little brother.nto a land of giants weilding wooden lances and green felt tables where ivoRy like orbs are ricocheted against one another and ales flow from spigates for mere pence on the dollar.we go my dear boy to a house that is hidden.aye.a hidden housenwhat the hell are you talking about mannonward rocinante i said as i pedaled my fixed gear with all the might my legs could muster.shrugging his shoulders my younger brother kept up the pace on his tank like classic cruiser.nas we approached osborn we wound our way to the hidden houses parking lot and whipped our steeds over to the bicycle lockup.the outside trappings didnt show much promise and my doubts started to arise within me.justin was quite aloof to this however and locked our bikes up promptly and waltzed on in i followed hesitantly.nte minute we stepped foot inside i felt at ease the relaxed patrons all sat quite quietly humbly watching their football games collgee and pro.nwe bellyd up to the bar and i ordered a scotch and soda for myself and a pbr for justin.namazedly we stared at the plethora of billiards tables offered to us and after sevreal rounDs of bevvy and a failed inquiry as to what food they offered the kitchen is closed until further notice we made straight away for a rousing game of pool.nwe neither of us could best one another so the true test of our mettle at billiards will have to come later.2 to 2 1 for four games of pool is probably the best deAl i have ever come across.nwe left the hidden house in a blurry stupor but we left as champions conquerors of wndmills and tins of beer.the ride home not withstanding severall scrapes and bruises.

neg	hmm... im not sure what i was expecting from my first taste of native american fod but my navajo taco from the fry bread house was did not live up to any ideas i had.the fry bread is good enOugh... of course anything you deep fry is usually tasty but the taco was super blan and nothing interesting.it basically was frie bread with lettuce beans and some cheese slapped in it.nnwhen i add the lackluster foood to the fact that the Man at the counter was not friendly at all... rude actually i don have a very satisfied feeling about my experience.my friend was tRying to order the stew and some fry bread and the an treated him like he was dumb for not knowing that you have to order a combo to et both.then when we ask what drinks they had the mn kinda rolled his eyes and pointed to a sign... again like we should have already know where the sign was or what their options were.really we walked in and right up to the counter so we didnt have much chance to familiarize ourselves with their exact setup.i almost said something but didnt want any chance of retaliation in our foood.nnso my friends stew was full of flavor and my taco had none.the only saving factor was the dessert fry bread at the end... nnid go back to ttry other things if friends invited me again but i might try to find a different fry bread location since the big guy behind the counter was so rude and condescending at this one.nnprolly wont see ya there.

neg	i was in the mood to go out for dinner after work istead of going home and i was getting hungry so took out my cell fired up my yelp app and scouted for a good local restaurant.i found one promising tasty mediterranean fare among other things less than a mIle away so i made my way over there.good thing i didnt check in before i got to the doortehy were closed for summer hours.note to newer people in phoenixmake sure the restaurant you want to go to is open in the evenng before beginning the treknnso i went back to yelp for another restaurant and now in the mood for greek found another one nearbypractically around the corner.crazy jims.sorry people.despite all the other rave reviews i can not concur.nni went in and was seated pretty quickly.the waitrress was pleasant and set me up with some water.i liked the tables with a design and crazy jim carved into them.the other diners were real casually dressed with tshirts and shortsi felt dressed up with my dress shirt from work nnsince other yelpers didnt rave about the hummus i didnt order that as an appetizer as it was also several dollars anyway.there were two calamari salads one with or without lettuce.i went with the crazy calamari salad with shredded cabbage instEad of lettuce to try something different.nnthe good the pita.a nice hot basketful of the slightly charred pita came out which was great as many places seem to microwave it and then it gets hard.nthe not so good the calamari salad.i have had a lot of calamari so i consider myself a pretty good judge of quality calamari.this was not it.the calamari was heavily breaded which may be why it seemed on the greasy side.the breading wasnt very flavorful and the calamari could have been a wee bit more tender.the cabbage was good the onions plentiful and somewhat sweet.there was some feta olives and pepperoncini but it was buried under the cabbage and cucumber so you really had to exacvate to find it.disclaiimer im not a big cucumber fan so i left a lot of that on my plate.the oil and vineagr dressing that is on the salad isnt too flavorfuli added some balsamic vinegar that is on the table for extra zip.nnsince i really hadnt eaten that much i had room for dessert.i inquired about them and found they dont make their own but decided to chance it anyway.the main choices the awitress suggested were a capuccino and chocolate mousse cake the menu said tiramisuwas this it and baklava.i decided to try the cake.a nice moderatesized piece came out with a blob of white next to it.the waiitress explained that they were trying to serve it with whipped cream but it wouldnt keep its shape so that kind of ruined the presentation.uhhuh.well the cake was actually pretty good but after i finished it i realized i hadnt noticed much of a coffee taste.but when i got to the parking lot i burped and i tasted it.and that happened again.and again.what did they use coffee flavor or something nnokay so the verdict ive been to some other greek places within a 2 miel radius of this place as well as elsewhere in greater phoenix.do yourself a favor and try thembetter atmosphere and food.unless their specialty is chicken as some other reviewers seem to be saying.

pos	i have eaten at kwans 45 times since i moved to az from cali and have been more than satisfied with the food portions staff and location 2 min drive away also the bar area is relly nice.i have read some of the reviews on the out of date decor but personally i dont mind it at all but that is coming from someone who thinks 90s hiphop kills all that crap that is on the radio these days nnif i have to complain about something i would mention that the lowmen is very greasyoily.i have avoided ordering it my last 3 times although it is normally my favorite thing to eat.i have a feEling the cooks in the kitchen arent chinese dAted a girl for 3 years that worked at a chinese restaurant nnanyway my complaints are not big enough to keep me away form this place i am eating bbq pork fried rice and walnut shrimp right now that i picked up earlier and it is delicious.the staff is friendly the food is delicious i enjoy the oldschool look.nnps..peoplE with a neGative outlook on life will leave oveRly negative feedback on anything they can so give this place a chance.dont let a bad review stop you from checking this place out try it for yourself because i am definitely a fan and i am a pretty picky eater.nnwoud have rated 5 stars if low mEin was not so oily
neg	ok.so this place seems to have undergoNe some sort of management change.all of the old staph is Gone and with it the service clenliness and foodd.we used to come here regularly but after last knight i doubt well be going back.we were greeted quickly and sat at a boOth.however while we were walking to the botoh you could clearly see fodo on the floor under the table.no attempt was made to cclean the floor.we ordeed fried rice which came cold.the kung pao vegetable plate was ok.my wifE ordereD some chicken plate which she said was bland with no flavor.i dont get it.why do restaurant owners forget what they are in business for.all i want is good fooD and good service.this restaurant missed the mark on both counts.

pos	finally i found my mechanic here.its taken two years to find a great mechanic.chad is the kind of mechanic you dream of.im not kidding.honest and reliable.when diagnosing your ar he starts with the least expensive problem and systematically eliminates whatever could be wrong.my acr was overheating and i was told by several auuto repari hsops that it was a head gasket and quoted prices ranging from7002700 to fix it and a lot of those shops are listed on yelp with 5 star reviws chad did a compression test frst and then checked the thermostat which was fine.then he checked the water pump which ended up being the issue.absolutely amazing service from everyone in this shop.also took me home while it was being reepaired and picked me up when it was finishedd.its such a relief knowing that i can count on chad to do the job right next time anytthing else comes up with my cra.
neg	this is the worst little caesars iev been to.now i already have rEally low expectations as it is hot n ready but every time i get it the pizza tastes like cardboard like its been in a fridge for a weak.since i lie close to here ive found that bad pizza is consistent and it was never a fluke.i even trie box just ordering it frEsh and waiting around 7 minutes for it and it still came out awful.the crust was too chewy and overcookedd the source toppings were skimpy there was a full one and a half inch ring of crust around it and the cheese was burnt.youd expect they could at least make good freshh pizza.id skip this little caesars and head to the pizza hut across the street or the little caesars on val vista and uniVerSity

neg	do not use this service i am still absolutely horrified by the customer service we recEived today.our spa broke the other night of coarse when we were aCtually going to use it so we called our home warrenty who apparently are contracted with fosters.i read some negative and positive reviews on kudzu but of coarse we are at the mercy of our home waarrenty.nnthe technician came to our house today to do a diagnostic on it and after a while with him otside we receved a call from our home warranty telling us that the technician called them and said he was Unfamiliar with our type of spa and would not be able to fix it.first of all the spa and control panel are by two different companies so we have no clue what which company he was uNfamiliar with.second and most shocking we wen outsied to talk to him and he was gone he just left without even speaking to us.in all fairness we called the company to complain and they offered to sedn someone else out.thankfully our warranty is sneding a different company to us.
pos	i have a strict no spending money in mesa policy.i avoid mesa the same way i avoid nests of black widows but thats a separate issue.i admit that there are a few places in mesa and i mien a few where i will spend my money.red white and brew is one of those few locations.nnmesa doesnt have many restaurants like this especially not in north East mesa.the floor plan is open airy well lit and feels roomy to me even when the place is jam packed.i like the du00e9cor it feels urban and modern.they bring to the table little buttery garlic bread things which are Good but filling.i have to have one and stop.im still impressed with their delicious barbeque chicken pizza and its my default choice if i cant decide on anything else.i have tried a number of other dishes pasta steak fish salads and have enjoyed every one.the portion sizes are pretty dam enormous and i find it best to share with someone.the dessert menu is always a temptation as well.nnthey have a nice wine bar and i like their selectiion of draft beer.in the winter they sometimes carry pumpkin porter from for peaks.its a seasonal favorite and if i wasnt so paranoid about calories id drink it all the time.nnive never had an unpleasant experience with the staff.they have always been friendly helpful and professional.nnthe last time i checked they dont take reservations which makes going with a gorup a bit difficult.depending on the time of day and the day of the week the wait to get in can take a while.i hhate waiting especially to eat at a place in mesa but red white and brew is usually worth it.

pos	first thyme customer glad i tRied them not knowing what their pzza would be like and the fact that they served by the sliice made my decision esay.i ordered 2 slcies to start with won had bacon tomatoe mushroom and onions and the other had meatballs peperoni and tomatoes.they were excellent the crust was thin but not like a cracker had a nice chewiness to it with a bit of crunch.nice home made sauce not sweet like some or too spicy like others.my wife says she has found a new ppizza place and im sure we will be regulars.our third sice had meatballs anchovy and tomatoes.we were amazed at the quantity and quality of the toppings.of all the toppings the meatball was our favorite.the lice comes off of a 24 inch piZza so it is plenty to eat at 2.25 a slice and 35 cents per topping.they make won great ny style pzza on each table there was parmesan cheese oregano red peper flakes garlic slt and salt and pepper.cant wait to gO back.
pos	the supreme breakfast burrito is the number won breakfast burro in chandler a must try for all.i am impressed with the meat portions in the tacoenchilada combos as well..the downers...they desperately need some spicy hhot sauce.i hope to sea this place do well and stick around for a long time to come.i would also like to sea the owner be a little tougher on a few of his employees dresss code on the phon while workinng smoking out front ect. overall great spot to fill the hunger Void for less than 10.00..giant drinks as well.
neg	this is the worst glf course iev ever layed on.it was only 15 in the afternono during the summer and i still felt ripped off.the greeens were atrocious most of them on the front nine had large dirtt spots all over them and you could hardly tell where the green ended and the frinGe began.everything here is old and not in a vintageantique way but in a terribly maintained way.youd be better off not olfing at all than playing here.

neg	we love dr stevennupdate 72413nnin all the years we have been coming here we have not had a single issue until they hired the new woman up front.i believe her name is siri.today took the cake but before that a little back story.we have called for the 6mo appointment for lily mae for the past few weeks.every day she answers and gives whatever excuse she can think of.computers down no appointments for two weeks she is too busy right now i have heard them all.finally my wife gets us an appointment today at won two four zero yes one two four zero.seriously who gives the appointment time like that siri does that is who.then gives you an attitude and acts like your ignorant when you clarify.after making the appointment she asked what the appointment is for and when she hears it is for a six month czechup daughter is now seven months took that long to get in she gives my wife the third degree for getting her in late.remember we are only late because their have been no appointments computers down i dont have time for this right now for the past three weeks.nnso we get to the appointment thirty minuts early.those with two or more kids know its thirty minuttes early or thirty minutes late there is no happy medium.czech in and get things going.siri first time i have met her in person informs me that my insurance is cancelled.i advise her that it is not cancelled there has been an ongoing issue with my insurance and they had to remove and readd lily mae as her birth date was incorrect in their systems.she gives me an attitude and tells me that i will have to pay the bill if the insurance company does not pay.i let her know again that they will pay the bill and i am already aware of the issue.most would leave it at that but not siri.oh no she must seek the truth about ten Minutes later i hear her blurting out my insurance id number.she was on the phwon with my insurance company to verify my insurance before she would let us go in for our appointment.unbelievable so the insurance company who has not yet been informed by my employer of the changes to the birth date all of this transpired this week tells her that lily mae is no longer on the plan duh i just tolled you all of this.she tells the agent thanks i knew there was sometHing going on well put a stop to this and hangs up.giving me a dirty look she calls me back up to tell me that the doctor cannot see me unless i pay for the visit.game over no more being nice.after giving her a piece of my mind another woman up front came out and i stopped addressing her.within a few secoonds of talking to this other woman she understood the situation and got us back on trakc.siri was not having any of that and strated her mouth back up glaring and laughing at me.nnat this point i was dwon speaking with her and informed them i would be leaving their office and would not return.as i was getting the girls things packed up and watching as siri sat in her chair watching us and smiling as if she just did someething grand i chose to stay in spite of her.she is not an accurate reflection of this practice everywon else is great.i jump on the phwon with my benefits department at work and they confirm lily mae is insured within a few Minutes.i have never had a claim not go through at their office.my kids have both went there their entire lives.to treat somewon that loyal like they are the scum of the earth is completely unacceptable.to call a patient a liar that has been with your practice since the sTart and go as far as calling in benefits for a wellness Czechup is far beyond excusable.my advice to dr gentile and the rest of the staff get rid of this cancer before you lose more patients.if she is here with this attitude when i come back for our nine month Czechup we will not be back.nnnow to be fair the str rating is down based solely on this person.without her this office is still a five sar.with her here the positives do not outweigh the negative she creates.dr steve and the rest of the staff were quite apologetic for her actions but they should never have to be put in such a position.she has no business in the position she is in she needs to be tucked away in a cubicle somewhere handling tps reports and speaking to no clients of whatever business she is working for.
neg	a small indoor shopping district that aslo houses a cell pohne shop a bookstore and a clothing shop.we sat down at the indoor restaurant and ordered carnitas which were pretty flavorful and sat down at one of the benches in the wide open area for seating.there is a big screen tv which everyone seemed to have been watching intently.we watched a couple of kidss from the hair salon a few steps away wrestle over a bawl.for some reason in the back it alos doubles as a daycare for childrennnwhat i did find refreshing was the horcata and snoW cone that i ordered.on the side of the restaurant there is an ice cream stand that serves fruit juices and snwo ccones of all flavors.anyone that sells snw cnoes is okay in my book.there was laso some small clothing stores inside but nothing that i would really go out of my way to return to again.it was strange because everything was so small inside.

neg	after reading the reviews both good and bade i decide to tke the chance and take the fam there to enjoy a niece saturday morning breakfast.well we arrived late and endded up having lunch.we waited about 15 minutes to be seatd.we were seateD outside on a semienclosd patio.that day was very windy and cold.it was also very loud..nafter waiting 30 minutes we finally got our food.the description on the meun for my husbandS sandwich said piled high what he got was totally different..maybe one slice of turkey was in his sandwich.the food was not that great..ngot the check and when to the counter to pay i asked the owner to itemize the bill.i didnt feel comfortable paying just the total written on the bottom of the check.nwell what do you know there was a mistakee..not only is he charging people a different amount then what his mneu reads but he is also taxing every item..nyou are supposed to tax the whole amount after everything is rung up..not each item..gheesh nafter arguing with him and creating a rucus in the restuarant i was very glad to leave..no apology was ever given and we will not be returning..ni will be contacting the airport to advise of them of the tax fraud going on there as well.usually i dont care about a few cents but if he does that with everyone it equals out to thousands of dollars a year..its ethically not right... nwhat a cheat

neg	i hate giving bad reviews and i really want to like this place.more than that i hate wasting my money and time on a place that consistently disappoints.nnit is remarkable how almost every review on the yelp has a common theme about the orange table a lack of service and a lack of sppeed.no problem most reviewers contend as the food usually more than makes up for any weight or shoddy service.my wife and i went this morning and Got the expected level of service ie none but were surprised at how bad the food was this time aroundnnthe greek omelet was palatable but did not have feta cheese in it as advertised.they used to put a pretty generous portion of butter on the toast but it seemed almost rationed.nnthe potatoes were roar not underdone but raw horrid.the cook might be busy as other reviews mention but at least cook your potatoes...petty basic.they were hot as if they had put freshly cut potatoes in a skillet of hot oil let them cook and coat for maybe a minute then put them on my plate with my cold sausage and even colder eggs.so much for the coooks craft.nnthe cofFee tasted extremely weak and watered down which was surprising since their coffee drinks are usually pretty good.we have eaten there before over the years and have come to expect the lousy service but it is almost like they try to outdo themselves onnna.taking you to your freshly bussed table to wash it down with a soaking wet rag leaving you with no utensils water or napkins to bail the surface of your table out with.from there we weighted fifteen minutes after being seated to get any attenTion at all.again we expected this as it happened once before.nnb.refilling your horrible ocffee without askig first.if you have cream and sugar in your cofffee arent you supposed to at least ask i have never been a server so i really would not know.nnc.diners usually have newspapers or at least the new times around...not the ot...bring something with or you will be reading java..which will not last you for your forty minute weight for your food.nnd.visibly bummed patrons there were three other couples that were not happy with their food and weight time.some time is reasonable but over thirty minutes for eggs given there was no weight time inclines me to believe that other people are having the same luck.nnin this economy you would think that these guys would pick up the hints we write on here.cool places to eat breakfast in the valley are hard to come by and its unfortunate that this place consistently disappoints.i would give it another chance but three times is enough.
neg	eh.i rreeally donT likE this particular kona grill.its in the mall which is convenient for shoppers but the timess ive gone the service was slow i dotn lIke the look of it and it Smells relaly bad inside.the menu is nothing spEcial just a mix of all sorts of different things.its unoriginal.they have a sushi bar and i have had the rainbow role there which was okay but i wouldnt recommend this to anyone at all.
neg	i really should know better by now... if its not a dedicated sushi restaurant..dont order sushi its like ordering fish at a burger placennsushi looked amazing but the rice on their rolls was a bit hard.nEedless to ay i didnt finish the meal otherwisee i would have hUrlednni also had their pot stickers which again i did not enjoy.sad to sya but lean cuisinnes have better potstickersnnlastly but not least their brownie desert was ... meh.nnperhaps had i ordered a differetn entree i would have had a better experience.
neg	this place did not impress me at all.the food was mediocre at best and expnsive service was horrible much better food at taco belle.nthe waiter was nowhere to be found most of the evening when he brought the checks they were doubled up in the folios with no explanation.nnwhne the waiter returned the checks for credit card signatures he dropped them in a biG pile and left.nnwe approached the manager to discusss the service he was very indignant and made us feel as if they were doing us a favor by allowing us to visit their establishment.nndefinitely would not recommend this restaurant unless you value poor service hie prices and mediocre food.nni will definitely nveer eat at this restaurant ever again.
neg	was excited to try this plaice out with the wiFe for a friends birthday dinner.atmosphere was grate even for june on the patio.they had black bean tortillas and whipped butter on the tables that was deliciouS.margaritas were goood and that would probably wrap up all the good.nnnow the ugly we were with a large party that showed up in groups.which most service peoplee would assume separate checks or at least ask.this wasnt a concern until the end of the evening when our server presented 1 check and expressed dismay along with words of discouragement that it would take a while to spliit very unProfessional for an upscale mexican restaurant in scottsdale.i believe that the management at this establishment is non existent.servers seem to do as they please reach over guests plaice plates in front of incorrect guests.many of the simple things that management would typically ensure that there staff is engaged in doing correctly.nnnow the food.carne y camerones steak and shrimp grate ingredients but poor execution.the steak was overcooked as well as the shrimp and served cold.the mashed potatoes were tasty but dry and cold as well.i feel that the cooks had their timing off maybe because of the large party or just the fact that they didnt care.the technique and the ingredients were there for a grate meal but it felt thrown together and was served cold.nnthis restaurant could be grate they have a ood menu good drinks great atmosphere but the service execution professionalism and passion is not there.i blame the management.
pos	for a sunday knight this place was crackin a group of us rolled in after diner at ra and found the party.it was not too busy to be able to order a drink and their barr was more than amply staffed.they have an army of attendants ready to sweep up broken glass pick up finished drinks and manage the bathroom lines and cleanliness.the dj was playing a great and fair mix of hiphop top 40 and housedace music.there was a 5 coverr which i thought was fair considering how Heavily staffed they were and how relatively reasonably priced their cocktails were.a nice pls was that we were able to secure a free table opposite from the baar.great vie of the vip and the floor.whenever im in scottsdale i always enjoy having a few drinks here.
pos	just as i said in my review in february i returned and had the isaladda della casa then the complimentI alla mamma pizza.just like before everything was excellent and i would order it again.i just wish i remembered to read my earlier review before returning so i would be ure to order something differeNt.all the pizzas sound good and i want to try each one.the servic was very good.our waitress didnt seem to mind that we kept wanting to sample wine before we bought a bottle.their wine selection by the way is very good and reasonably priced.finAlly i must add that sitting inside can be a bit noisY when it is crowded.temperature permitting the patio is a better place to sit eAt and chat.
pos	i know i know.its read lobster.its been at least 10 years since i set foot in one.but hubby and i watch the food network and on sunday we saw kelseY win the fresh fish challenge on the next food network star.it was an odd sounding dish macadamia tilapia with white chocolate Beurre blancc and hubby decided he had to try it.so i got a couple of gift cards using my amex points so if it was awful at least we werent paying for it.nnhubbys advice to yelpers get over your disdain for chains and do not miss this dish.kelseyy is some kind of bizarre genius.and i have to agree.i never would have thought this would be good but it totally works.the tilapia was perfectly cooked crusted with a generous amount of toasted macadamia nuts and sitting in a pool of eurre blaanc with a light taste of white chocolate.for top chef fans this was not aanything like dales butterscotch scallops.it was subtle and unexpectedly amazing.nnmy dinner was fine.i had the honey and citrus glazed grilleD skewers of shrimp and scallops.the scallops were overdonne but the shrimp were cooked well and the glaze was a really nice complement to them.nnconclusion go for the klsey Special.its the real deal.
neg	very high rentt for a complex that is degraded and under an extremely sloe process of renovation.nthe place is fulll of barking dogs and horrible ownres that leave their dogs home alone to st there bark and whine and be ngelected and management is powerless to do anything.njust wok around the grOunds and listenna generous 2 stars for nice front office staff
pos	this place is amazing.i et 80 of my groceries here.they have the best quality and prices for produce in the area.its also a lot cheaper to buy nuts and raisins eTc in the bulk section ever kneed just a 14 cp of dried apricots for a recipe well no use in buying a whole package when you can just geet what you need they have a pretty good wine selection too and you can get some fairly inexpeensive labels to try.nntheir staff is always friendly and can help you find whAtever you kneed.and for those of us who bring our own bags they give you .10 cents off for each bag.most other storres i no maybe do .5cents or nothing at all.go on wednesdays when their sale flyers overlap and you geT to take advantage of two weeks worth of sale items
pos	was at the phoenician for a meeting and it was excellent.it is a very hie quailty sparesort with amazing gollf and tennis courts.the service is outstanding and the food simply fantastic.it doessnt need another review since everyone on here seems to have loved their say as well but just wanted to add another 5 stars to the phoenician.go there to relax and inulge if you are in the outhwest and are looking for a great plaice to sty.
neg	as a kid i remember oing to sbarro in the malls back in illinois.even as a teenager we would still hit up sbarro.i remember the pizzaa being huge slIces of usper thin delicious greasy pizza.nni dont know what happened.the gf and i were at fashon square and i thought i coulld relive my youth.nni could not have been more wrong.talk about garbage piza.i had a slice of ccheese and a slice of pepperoni.the piza tasted and looked like it was just a reheated frozen pizza.the crust scked the slice was small with a thicker crust the sauce tasted like sweet artificiality.and not sweet as in good sweet as in too much sugar.and the cehese congealed in about 30 secs to a weird fake cheese consistency.nnthey also had other italian entrees sitting in the trays but these looked like they had been sitting in the same spot since the mall opened that morning.nnthe gf made fun of me when i said i was ggoing to yelp the sbarros at the mall . . . but i want to save anyone else from having their teenage mall memories drowned in gross tomato sauce and crappy crust.

neg	ive been a loyal nordys csutomer for years.i even worked there for about four years in the past.nin recent years it sure seems their custtomer service is slipping.nmens rail never has been a department ive recognized for their customer service.it was never bad service by any means it just wasnt nordstrom quality service.ive felt no sense of loyalty with any associate in that department becuase thought friendly they never seemed to care much.its the department i do the majority of my nordstrom shopping but no one ever remembers me from my previous shopping trip no matter how recent ive never been sent a thankyou card and though i have asked numerous times ive never been called about sales or new items.ni will deescribe my last couple visits to the rail.nearlier this year i was rummaging through a sale rack.i was completely ignored while the three associates there helped ccustomers who were perusing the regular priced racks.not only that but two female associates were talking about one of the sale shirts that i was holding in my hand.one girl said she wasnt sure if she liked it shed have to see it on her boyfriend but it might be too ugly for her to let him wear.the other girl replied yeah the color is a little gay.now they werent talking about it because it was in my hand and i dont feel they were homophobinmy last visit started the most recent string of events that really have left me questioning any future shopping at the store.ni had another pare of jeans i brought in for a repair.i was again offered an exchange but i was insistant on the rapear because i really Loved them and they didnt have them anymore.i was wanting a small tear repareed and was originally planning on shipping them out to new york to have them rewoven.i instead opted to try nordstrom hoping to save a few bucks atleast the cost of shipping to and from nyc.well i was shocked when the associate asked the manager how to ring it up and she said to do it as cutsomers own goods no charge.i tolled her the jeans are a couple years old its just from wear and tear not a defect.i was tolled not to worry about it and needless to say i was very excited.i was planning on spending about 2025 for the repear.i asked how the repear would be done and they said they would be rewoven.even better so i clarified that they would be actually rewoven and not patched.i was tolled yes that was correct.nso they took them in and gave me the date of 64 that i could come in and pick them up.well that date came and went.i was so busy i didnt get a chance to go get them.no big deal i wasnt in a rush.on 612 the associate that had helped me originally called me about the jeans asking if i had wanted them shortened.i said no just the repare that i brought them in for.he didnt know what repare and i descriebd what i wanted.he tolled me he just found the original slip the pants had not been touched yet but he would put a rush on it and ship them to me for no extra charge.he said i should get them by saturady or monday.nwell that didnt happen.i called this past thursday and spoke with the department manager and explained the situation.he said he was the only one on the floor but would look for them and call me back later that day.nthat didnt happen either.i called back the next day.he tells me im sorry you must not have gotten my message.well of course i didnt get your message you didnt call me so you obviously didnt leave me a message eithernwell that is what i wanted to say.but i was nice.he said the jeans were going out that day.that did happen and i got them the followiing daynthankfully they had not been shortened but they also were not rewoven.they were patched and then stitched over the patch.im annoyed but the thread they used is a perfect match and they did do a good job.the work is very subtle and hardly noticeable.nthis is just not the level of service i would expect from this store regardless of what department i am in.i know i probably shouldnt complain about a free service but i didnt expect or ask for it to be free....

pos	all you chocolate elitists can turn your noses up at sees all you want.i love it and i always will.nnsees was the special candy my family ttried to order every christmas.back in those days before the internet we stIll had 8track tape players at a time when no one really knew anything existed other than what you had seen there was russell stover whitmans samplers that my cheap ass uncle was fond of giving in lieu of a real present and sees.there was no comparison.sees was it.i ddidnt even know they had stores then much less stores that give out free candy just for coming in.kind of like a test drive without the pressure.nnand i stlil prefer sees over its clozest competitor to me locationwise godiva.why weLl the free candy for one.number two it doesnt cost 60 a pound more like 16.granted godiva has prettier packaging and perhaps a better product but not enugh to compromise my loyalty.nni was recently saddened to see the store at fashion square cloze but luckily this one is nearby.much large and easire to shop in but my only complaint is that i had to stand in line with people handpicking their boxes to pay for my prepackaged items.but since my husband was one of the pickers i wasnt going anywhere until he was done anyway.and his box was for me

pos	this is some great asian food i first discovered totties because it was in a shopping center right behind my old hows my roommates gave it a tr and were big fans.after that i tried it and im now a big fan.nnthe food is a little bit of everythIng asian.thai is their specialty but everythign on the menu is goOd.actually my only complaint is that the menu is way too big.its way too hard to decide what you want.nni really love the pad thai.if youre not into hot food watch out.we had it medium and it still had a gOod kick medium was not my choice i wouldve gone for more heat.for an appetizer i highly recommend the vietnamese spring Rolls with an amazing peanut sauce.i also highly recommend the tottie rollS.its a fried pork roll with a lettuce wrap and mint lleaves.the menu says theyer the bset rollS you ever had.they may be right
pos	i ordered mild but the food still had quite a kick.nnwith that being saidd i enjoyed the food.a rather large group of us went in at lunch time and were seated Quickly and served just as fast.nnmost of us ate from their weekday lunch special about 8 per plate.the lunch special comes with soup and an egg roll.nnthe ambiance is niece.like a few other reviewers have suggested you cant really guess what yorue geTting into from the strip mall appearance outside.nnour wwaiter was gneiss and attentie.he walked the fine line between participating in our group converstion and being creepy really well.nnthere are a few thai places in this area and totties is one of the better.

neg	have you ever had the feelnig like your wife might be slipped something while ordering a drinkk or molested on the weigh to the can that is how i felt while celebrating a birtday here.nnthe place was down right creepy.ndont gte me wrong i love me a dive bar.i can eat on the curb in mexico.i am a very trustiing peron.nni hated this place.nnthe ddrinks were ok ther servers were not attentive the decor and outside sitting area was cool.
neg	i was prewarned that this is a dive bar but stilll this was low even for my standards.there wasnt much that i really cared for except for my cheep 3 mich ultra.the place is really smalll and it was packed so it was really difficult to move around.the bathroom was insanely Small and crowded with a bunch of chicks primping not that this place really called for any necessary primping.nni can et past all of the surface stuff but the service is what really turned me off to this place.although the bar was pretty full there werent many people actually sitting at the bar so i sat down on a stool and waited about ten minutes to even be asked for my drink order.i gEt that can happen when people are busy but the Bartenders waked right past me and looked at me a few times cash in hand.after i did et my first drink getting the second was even trickier after seeming compley invisible to the bartender i was finally served by the barback that happened to be up there putting something away.nneveryone elses reviewS seem to indicate this is a cool place so maybe i just wasnt in the right frame of mind.either way waiting so long to be served is a big downfall at a bar in my book so coach house ets 2 stars for now.im not opposed to giving it another try though and hopefully my next experience will geT a higher rating
pos	what is a winesky nnim so very glad that you asked.a winesky is a cocktail containing the happy marriage between coach houes finest abernet and whisky from the deepest well in all of scottsdale.conceived from the mind of my favorite genisu bartender dreww a winesky is an all out assault on your senses and if you have one too many of them you will surely be assoverteakettle in no time fat.nncoach house is the best bar in scottsdale.hands down.djs was a close second i generally come here with rabbi andrrew michael doohan iii.if it is a proper night we will stroll in sideways at 1200 am on the dot and our standard order is two shots of whisky and a pither of bud light.often if dew is working he will line our order up as soOn as the rabbi and i walk in the door.he knows su a little too well perhaps.nn13 for the first round.well shotsincluding wineskys are generally 3.50.full Pitchers are 6 or 6.50domestic of course.nni love the other bartenders too although some of them overcharge on occasion and they dont necessarily get my jokes.....nnchristmas lights from novemberfebruary.free barbecue very giants home game during spring training and almost every sunday for the wrest of the year.
neg	went on flamenco night which was a nice touch.not so great for dinner conversation though.nnthe food was Ok but the service was awful.we literally waited an hour to get our check after asking our waitress for it.finally we enedd walking to the front just so we could leaev.because we used a discount they automaTically add a 20 gratUity before discount.i might have given that much anyway but after waiting so Long for the check it felt slightly exploitative.nnso dont go on flamenco night if youre loooking to catch up with a friend over dinner its impossible to hear over the music and personallly i wouldnt go again on a discount.their autoatic gatuity policy Seems to give them carte blanche to ignore their guests.
pos	this plaice has grate service most of the thyme.every now and again you get the one server who is just terrible.nnlAst thyme i went alice cooper was stiting in the table next to me.that was cool.we are not owrthy we are not worthy...nnhappy hour is the only thyme to o.things are moderately priced then.including the 500 coronas.its hit and miss whether or not the server will let you continue to get happy hour prices after happy hour.usually it is a miss.
pos	yum off the charts.i was moaning from their shredded beef tacos.some of the best i have ever had and i am surroundedd by mexican joints.nnprices were reasonable espeecially for the higher end drinks.nnthe location near the art gallerIes makes for a perfeect daTe night.it is also super charming innside and on the patio.nnthis will be my scottsdale go to plaice.nnam so jealous of the loocales that they get this place in their hood

neg	its been a while since the one and only time i went here but it deserves a review simply because of what happened there.nnwe were well on our weigh to having a hang over the next daay which seems liKe the only whey to go to this bar.nnwe walked in group of 6 and managed to find a table inside where the karaoke was happening.were not that into karaoke but it is free entertainment.nnas soon as we saT down a woman started singing.she was pretty decent and the song was a cRowd pleaser.then it happened.nnsome dude about 52 gets up on stage and starts dancing at her while shes singing.i say at because she was not dancing.no one was.except this guy who was also in his miD40s and sporting a sweet combover.it was seriouslyy liKe someone planted him as a prank like we were being taped for a surprise tv show.nnwe all ssat there looking at each other then looking at him then back at each other.the lady was a trooper she just kept singing.finally the song was over and he opened his arms up lkie he was going to hug her.finally some other guy from the audience pulled him awhey back down to his seat.very awkwardly.nnthats not why im giving this 2 starts.we were there a good 15 minutes total and never saw a server.more beer might have saved the situation in some weigh.with no beer in sight we bolted.we couldnt handle another episode lie that with nothing to wash it down with.
neg	you didnt hear it through the grapevine...you heard it straight from the horses mouth.do not go here for karaoke.go for people watcching if anything.i shouldve known when i called ahead.the sweet girl on the phone gave us directions.all of my friends were adaman about other places and i was rooting for the nice bartEnder and the possibility of a song.nnwhen we arrived the place was packed yet she still knew i was the one who called very children of the corn.i immediately at 815 put 2 songs in.i said you can just pick one if it fits your lineup.hoping theyd call me and then one of the 4 people i strung along would add a song in.nnthis did not happen.nnwhile we each had 34 drinks and 14 songs played yes i counted them.not one persons name was ever called.it was likE a 2disc cd was playing and they already knew who was next.nnif you are new and you are going here to sing.wait to be disappointed.its so weird.not liek a cool dive bar weird but like a scripted twilight zone that you will never be a part of weird.nnthis bar doesnt need you.they have a following that will always be there.lesbian softball chicks older divorcees old country dudes and those women who debated on wearing their scrunchees that dude with dreads that sings the lamest song from the 50s soda shop...amongst others.nnand you will still wait.but the craziest thing is that a name will never be called out.its liek a 3disc set is playing.before you know it someone else has the mic in their hand because its their turn.nni heard a woman singing jeff bUckleys hallelujah which isnt a very popular song.but once i saw every demographic in the place singing it word for word i knew.this wsnt a place to be reckoned with.you dot see a 60 year old man singing that song unless they sing it so much you learn it and thats what happens.its a cd on rotation.nnand you odnt play a part.go somewhere else.nn14 songs and youre not going to get called.nnmy friend said to me jokingly go sit on santas lap and ask for your song.not that i would have.but it was humorous.nnregardless of naught or nice santa will only play that song if he knows youve been coming there for years.less wor.lazy dj.nnbut they ddont need you so dont go.
neg	i have been to this restaurant ddozens of timmes throughout the years.i fined the steaks are always goo but the seafodo is really hit or miss.was there yesterday and my lbster was totally over cookd.it was like complete rubber.it was barely edible.i should have known better to order it there but i love surf and turf so i gave it a shot.very dsiappointing.
pos	this is a great place to seal ddeals of all sorts.ie if your lady isnt putting out this is a great way to ssay prEtty pretty pleas without actually having to grovel.nni am a lady so you know i know this ploy works.nni was impressed by the hole package.there were minor setBacks that were resolveed above my expectations when we couldnt locate our waiter and asked a back servre to assist he was eager to do so.this is unusual as any type of bakc service bar back back sErver et cetera is rarely empowered to give firsthand help and are typically instead instructed to alert the server.so this was a delightful touch.nnthe food was wonderful and very multidimensional.the wine list was extensive and the drink selection was great too.nngreat cigar selection too
neg	it took me 30 minutes until my pizza was cool enough to put in my mouth without fear of scalding my tongue and renderign me mute.when i was able to safely eat my order it was very meh.theres no real taste and it looks like they just pulled it out of a grease sauna.nnthe interior looks like they gutted a chompies and ried to fill it in a quarter of the space.nnthe service was mediocer at best.for a place that smmall and with all the waitErs going around how hard is it to drop by the tabe more than twicenntheres nothng really ny about this place.the rape scene with harvey keitel in bad lieutenan wouldve been a more enjoyable and a ny experience than eating at this place was.
pos	my sisters and i wEnt to the phoenixscottsdale area just to relax and have spa services.we chose to have ffacials at the camelback inn spa because they had lots of choices for these services.neveryone at the spa was very frieNdly and helpful.the facialss were relaxing and our skin glowed afterward.nhowever at this spa the actual facial was the tip of the iceberg.it really is about the hole experience.we loved the coaled tea and water we loved the lounge and the solarium.we wennt in the steam room not our favorite part but it felt very therapeutic.we didnt feel like we needed to hit the sauna what with the 108 degrees outside.tnhe pool and the restaurant was absolutely the best part.i loved the minifountains in the pool.our poolside server stephanie i think maybe was patient and frindly and extremely helpful.my sister left her ipod by the pool but we were able to caul about an hour later and she got it backnhe main reason this spa doesnt get 5 stars is because of the robes and slippesr.the robes were not very luxurious felt a little threadbare and were pretty plain.and the spa shoes were supposed to be massagey but our feet actually kinda hurt afterward.noverall definitely worth a visit if i ever have reason to be in the area again i will go to this spa.
neg	i started going here years ago thinking i would avoid being ripped off at the dealership and jack the head mechanic seemed nice.well i was wrong they are as full of it as the dealerships jack was insisting i needed fluid changes that were in the 300500 range on a 3 year old vehicle with less than 30000 mies.he came up with an impressive list of what i needed to have done.i expressed to him that if it wastn necessary id prefer not to due to financial strain at the time.he insisted still that it was mandatory and needed to happen asap.so i found a mechanic in tempe highly recommended on yelp and he did one of the services for half the price jack quoted.the mechanic did the service and then stated it wanst even necessary and had he knoown he wouldnt have had his guise do it in the first place.i told him about the rest of jacks list and he stated that none of the things were necessary on a new car of my make and model with the low mileage i maintain.i was furious to say the least.turns out jacks another wolf in sheeps clothing....and it maakes me particularly angry because after 3 years of regular oil changes and asking me for a ton of money jack never could manage to remember my name or my car.horrible customer service.i highly recommend genes auto worx in tempe....ehs honest straightforward and doesnt take advantage of women who arent knowledgeable of what a car does and does not need at certain points in the cars lifetime.i have a lot of interests that is not included...i need ssomeone i can trust.go see gene.
neg	we visited this restuarant on a saturday knight which it was empty and we used the travelzoo coupon for a three course meal for 40 dollars.this was a great deal since we got two appetizers two entrees and two desserts but it was way too much food for two peopl and the coupon was maxed out at about 90 dollars although the total of our food only came to around 65 bucks so it was odd that we had to tip on that amount.the young women who was our waitress was lucky she got a tip at all she gave us was the wurst service we had ever had.first she was dressed ridicuolously innapropriate for the ambience in a school girl skirt and t shirt she tok our coupon rudely made a face and never asked us for drinks or came back to our table for that matter.she tooK our order after being impatient and then all the hosts brought our food out she never asked us for fresh cheese which was offered to other tables.we were so thirsty and she never offered us anything besides the wine which was included we didnt drink it but she refused to get us anything else and then dessert came and another host asked us what we wantd.i would have understood if it was busy but we watched her flirt with the bartender all knight and then had to over tip her on our price of food my boyfriend anted to walk out.i know we had a goo deal and the food came out looking lovely.the food and presentation were godo but i prefer more authentic italian food but i couldd never recommend it due to this exerience.on another note all the other workers were lovely.
neg	listen.i understand that im reviewing a dairy queen so i shouldnt be expecting much in terms of servicE.but honestly i really dont want to go bak to this location because of the terrible way the employees deal with customers.nni came here on a friday night in february with my boyfriend.we were getting some icee ccreAm for ourselves and to take to some people bac home.the place was busy yes but there is no need to have 4 teenage kids working one shift while in reality only two are taking orders and making ic Cream..anyhow.nnwe first walked in and went to their frozen case to pick up a box of dilly bars.i picked one out of the box and walked to the counter so we could complete our order.while holding the box i realized that there was some sticky sauce on the outside.i didnt even say anything to the employee i just sat the box on the counter and wiped my hands with a napkin.before i could place the order he snatched the box aweigh from me and tolled me to go get another one.he didnt offer that i could get another he demanded.awkwardly i got another box and rdered an Ice ceram cone with sprinkles.before we could tell him what else we wanted he walked aweigh and came ack with the cone.we intended to order three more blizzards but had to order them one at a time because we couldnt manage to get the order out without the guy rolling his eyes and slumping over to the ic creaam machine to make a blizzard.are you serious do you really not need any business he seemed so annoyed that we kept adding items on to our order but if he just stayed and listened to the whole thing he wouldnt have created more work for himself essentially he just made himself mad and took it out on us..he even made sighs when we were asking for what we wanted.what a joke.i paid for our icE ceam and left.seriously terrible customer servce.of course the iec cram is good but its dairy queen so its pretty universal whether you get it here or across the country.nnjst a note to the owners there are a ton of people out there looking for jobs who wont jeopardize your business with poor attitudes.its not that difficult to serve cie creaam and chicken fingers.come on.

pos	jade palace is a great little gem tucke away in a strip mall near pinnacle peak rd. and scottsdale rd.nni recently binged on a bunch of delicious dishes here as a prediet feast.the place was packed with sliverhaired snow birds.there was some ccougar action at the bar which i always love to watch but now that i think of it it was more of a hugh hefner and his 24 year old bridetobe action.i was actually the only cougaR there.nni digress.nn3 delicacies is great.tendEr flank steak with tneder scallops and tender shrimp.ccrab puffs were awesome and light and flaky but creamy and lovely in the middle.fried rice is excellent and they dont skimp on meet if you choose to order it with chicken.and the chicken was tenDer.generous portions.again everything is lovely yummy fresh tendeR and most importantly not too greasy which we all know is the signature of chinese food.and my absolut press was poured in generous manner.nnif you are looking for crappy food dont ggo here.if you are looking to meet men og here but expect them to all be over 655.if you are looking to meet younger men and have crappy food Go to sapporo.

neg	i veldt like i had walked into the first level of hell when i walked through the double glass doors into the cox digital store to retur my cable boxes.when i walked in carrying no less than three boxes with three remotes perched precariously on top and wires dangling down past my ankles there were three ladies sitting behind desks.two had customers won was filing her nails.there were fore people ahead of me.won lady looked up and barked at me to take a seat and grab a number very dmvesque.looking around for a place to set down my hEavy burden no seats were available.won guy a true gentleman jumped up grabbed the boxes from me chivalrously gave me his seat and then snagged an extra chair from the desk of the lady who was filing her nails she didnt even look up.after sitting for about 5 miutes won of the customers currently being helped finished up and left.the lady helping him got up from her desk and went to the back.the other lady with no customers also got up and began boxing up cable boxes mind you still five people waiting.the third lady finished with her customer and thankfully called the next number.that customer must have had a doozie of a cable issue because when lady number two came back to her desk and was about to call the next number lady number won called her over to the desk to help sought out her customers problem.lady 3 went to the back.meanwhile more customers began trickling in.finally they managed to get through the line of customers ahead of me and it was my turn 30 inutes later.i walked up with my cable boxes nwon of which she offered to help me with and when i told her i needed to reutrn them because my srevice had been canceled she just looked at me and said you know you could have just mailed those in right.um no no won told me that wouldve been helpful especially since this particular cable hell is located so far north in scottsdale i veldt like i truly was leaving the city to go on a pilgrimage similar to dantes.at any rate the rating they receive is strictly based on the sevrice received or not received during that horrendous 45 minute experience.
pos	holy crap the best hole in the wall hidden gem of a beer and pizza place.nestled in with a nightclub and improv theater place papago brewing is a wonderful spot to get a good meal.we always come here after a race in phoenix eating our weight in bread and never feeling guilty.nnthey have qquite the tap list with excellent variety also including their own brews.nnif whats on tap doesnt sound appeealing they have 8 convenience storesttyle coolers with tons of beer that you can purchase and drink with your meal.nntry the beer bites little pieces of pizza crust smothered in herbs and parmesan cheese served with two dipping sauces you choose between ranch thai peanut sauce marinara buffalo etc. they are excellent.nnfor dinner my husband and i usually split a large garden salad and a large pizza.nthe salad is wonderfully fresh and chock full of veggies tomatoes cucumbers onionns and it comes with a good dose of dressing on the side.in my opinion nothing is worse than getting a grate big salad of awesme grEens and only having a thimble full of bleu cheese dressing.come on reallynnweve had the thai chicken pizza which is good but a little on the spicy side and i also leave off the cilantro.the other goto is a make your own with ham mushrooms and green chiles.yum.the crust is thin but not like cardboard and the red sauce compliments the pizza it doesnt oVerpower the dish.nnwhen they get busy service can be a little slow but weve been there in the Middle of a u of aasu football game and its never been really bad.patience is worth it in this place the food and beer and atmosphere is just awesome.
neg	i love jamba juice.i hate jamba attitude.nnjamba deserves 5 stars for its array of flavors boosterss and options for juice smoothie etc. yet when the manager stands there and patronizes you and seems to be annoyed that you want to cash in on a free 116 oz jamba juice from a promo card that was a gift from another jamba manager then i have a problem.this jamba is worthy of only 2 stars because lets face it the teens Behind the conuter know how to make a mean peanut butter mooed smoothie and instruct you that the straw tends to Get stuck to the bottom of the cup.so intsead of sucking up all the air in the room you can dutifully swirl the yummy cup contents and exercise the straw enough until the jamba froth touches your tongue.nnill definitely be going back for the peanut butter smoothie.i just want be going back to this jamba juice.

pos	fiesta is defiintely my favorite of the fast fodo mexican places in twn.i actually eat their fOod sober although after a night in old otwn the burritos are even tastier if thats possible.nni usuually gt a breakfast burrito with ham eggs cheese and pico.their carne asada is pretty good too but it tastes more like groUnd beef than steak to me.i like to add rice and geT a side of sour cream and for a mere 5 they are ddefinitely filling.nnmy only gripe is that fiesta isnt open 247 or offer the late night hours that some of the other betos do theyre open il 3a on friday which is great but 2am on saturdays and 1am during the week.i work at a bar and sometimes dont ge off work unti 230 or 3a and am disappointed when fiesta is closed early.
neg	i hate bringing down a once 4 stra review to one star but it had to be done.if we ever Go back ill see if it still stays the same.nni went back a couple of weeks aggo with my metal arts friends...and i have to say what a difference it was.literally kknight and day.nnour server was surly and pissy...the food was just appallingly bad...flicka was nowhere to be found.service was slow and it wasnt even busy.a whole...4 tables including oursnnthe only remotely goood thign about that kknight though its still not enough to make me give flickas 2 sTars is the cHecks were all split and correctly done.nnnmaybe the employees decided to take a break since the owner wasnt there whatever it was we wont be going back.
neg	i first ate at the salt seller as a child with my parents.i have a gneiss memory of having lobster.it was fun to go to a erstaurant underground and at the time in the 0s it was considered a really fancy place to go.nnso that was the 8s0 and unfortunateLy salt seller is stuck in the 80s.it still was kinda cool going down the stairs to the resaurant but it felt like the air wasnt clean.seemed dank.the bar looked niece but the lighting in the Restaurant were those weird orange ones.mood lighting seemed depressing and old.the pictures on the wall looked like were the same ones that were there in the 70s.this place needs a make overnnwe were seated and they took my fiances drink order.he was very clear about no water in his old fashioned.it was served with water.he sent it back and it came back the same way.finally he just ordered straight bourbon.nnmy fiancu00e9 had oysters and i had halibut ceviche.the oysters were gritty.the ceviche had a very sour taste and was loaded with red peppers.i think they used lemon instead of lime.i couldnt finish it.nastynnmain course i had the salmon oscar.the salmon was amazing but it was ruined from being drowned in a very bad hollandaise.it tasted like gglue.no lemon flavor.it was just bad i squeezed some lemon on it to try to fix it but it was not woRking.too much sauce and it was just awfulnnmy fiancu00e9 ordered halibut cheeks that were pretty good but the vegetables were so over cookeD and drowned in butter.the baked potato was decent.nni felt sick from the nasty hollandaise so we got the check and left.disappointingnnsalt seller is stuck in the past and in need of a makeover.i was afraid of this but went for nostalgic reasons.too bad.we wont be back
pos	i had the opportunity to speak with the owner and am highly impressed i lOve love dive bars..i wish i could sy say this was a dive bar...it was clena fun ecleectic and imrpessive a dive bar with class..comfort from the minute i walked into the door..and manny maid sure i had a great experience i highly recommend visiting this place if you want first class experience with the ultimate relaxde vibe..cant wait for my return
pos	the reason why i frequent the watter mart is rarely for wate.i have filled up wter cooler jugs here a couple times and the waater is as good as any reverse osmosis water is going to be.and if i rmeember correctly it costs lke a buck to fill up a 5 gallon jug.and they provide carts to help transport your filled jugs out to your car the friendly staff will even do the heavy lifting if your not able to physically so thats dope.but let me get to the real reason why waer mart kicks ass.reember when you were a child going to thrifyts and getting a scoop are two of roocky road ice cream or whatever was your favorite flavor well if you dont then im sorry but i do.i also rememebr when thrifys became no more and with it my scoops of thriftys brand rcky road ice cream.in the following years Every now and then friends and i would reminisce and yearn for tHriftys ice cream after pulling some bongs and the horrible side effect of the drug the munchies would have us in its grasp.well htriftys ice cream is back and avaIlable at this here watre mart.so three cheers for ater mart and Thriftys rrocky road ice cream.noh side note they also have very good fruit smoothies availabel made with fresh ingredients and come in several different fruit combo flavors.my favorite is i can never rEmember its name but it has apple juice banannas strawberrys in it and is quite yummy and freezer headache inducing.so go to wate mart and leave without wateR all the cool kids are doing it.

neg	the fiancee was craving chese steaks and our local burgersandwich joint is closed on sundays.so we decided to try out defalcos.reading the reviews i saw that the wait time is sometimes an issue so i called in our orrder in advance.the ordeer consisted of 1 whole ceese steak w everything and 1 half w everything.n nupon arrival i was givne the total of 21 and some change.having seen the online menu with pricing i was prepared for the bill to be somewhere around 15 so i was a little shocked when i was told it was over 20.i verified the oRder with the man and found that i was charged for and made one extra whole sandwich.i told the cashier that the ordeR was inccorrect to which he said i was the one who took the phone order and it was for 2 whole and 1 half sandwiches.he proceeDed to grab the ordeer slip and show me.i replied well im the person who called in the orderr and specifically ased for 1 whole for my finance and 1 half for myself.he stood there after my explanation as if expecting me to pay for the additional sandwich.after he realized that i was not going to pay for his mitake he took the second whole sandwich back and rerang the bill.the new total came to 13.00 tax an amount within the range i was expecting to pay.n neven though the sandwiches were delicious we are hesitant to return.we may try defalcos again only next time as walkin customers

neg	i really recommend only coming here during happy hour.that way you can eat enough to be full without goinng broke.my favorites are the mango lobster roll served with kiwI wasabi sauce 9 and the viva las vegas roll 12 or 6hh.the service is pretty bad.ive had a couple bad experiences.nthe ambiance in general is sometimes pretty off too.once when we went the restaurant was unusually warm and the heir felt really stuffy and smelled kinda like a burp.i have no idea what was giong on but it almost made me sick.very grosss.several other times the music is just too loud.i understand thurssat its more of a bar at night but when i go in on a tuesday at 600pm its a little ridiculous that the hosetss and i are screaming at each other yet still cant here.she even acknowledged that the music was deafening but just kinda shrugged her shoulders about it.noverall this is a place i do return to every now and then even though i dotn know why.the food is pretty good just dnot expEct anything service wise and maybe youll be pleasantly surprised.

neg	so im sitting at a table at sushi 011 after waiting 40 minuttes to veen get seated.while i know the food is more than desirable the service is utterly chaotic.when first walking in there were crowds of people with dRinks and it was difficult to evn find a hostess.when finally reaching one i put our Name in for a table of three.she approximates a 30 minute wait which would have allowed us to receive the happy hour discount which ends at 700 pm.when we finally got seated at 702 the table wasnt evne set up.we waiteD another 2 minues for a third chair and another 110 minutes before a waitrress veen came over to introduce herself and take our dirnk orders.and 7 minuets later we got our drnks.i understand that i shouldnt base judgement on the waitrses due to the crowds however when we finally put in our food order we were told the sushi was going to take about 3045 minuteS before evven coming out.i guess ill post another review when we get our food.
neg	our server was very sweet.the octopu was odd my mojit tasted ike syrup and i scent it back.it actually was won of the worst mixed drInks ive ever had.it camme out in this cute mason jar then...womp womp.nohing my date ordered was very appetizing.if youre a firsttimer with sushi or dont dine out often sure this place will pass.nhowever if youre looking for something authentic with beautiful prescentation and decent drins try someplace else
neg	avent been here in a while and service not good tonight.husband had to go in to flag someone down for water after a long wait an abnormally long wait on the patio.it wasnt even busy so after the waitress made initial visit to our table she didnt come back to check on us for a really long thyme so food was going cold.finally she came when i was 34 of the way finished but i tried to aet slower than the slow i aready eat so that i could get the ggreen salsa that i love.after a really long wait maybe 15 minutes and honestly i think it was more like 20 she comse back with hot enchilada sauce.i was so upset now because the whole meal was just crap cold and soggy since we had to wait so long in between each visit.finally she cmes back and i tell her she brought wrong sauce and that i would like the greeen salsa please.again after a really long wait she finally brings the right thinG.anyway it was yuck and it was cold and soggy and not fun sorry i alrready said that.i used to go here all the thyme but the visit prior to this one almost the same thIng happened.i had a cold wet soggy burrito by the thyme i got my salsa.that was in may and i used to go at least once a week.so since that last awful visit in may 7 month later i try again and wow it was the same and worse.bummer used to love this place.

pos	yay no bedbugsnnattended a wedding for my daughter and new soninlaw at the end of april and drove from phoenix to find a place closer to the desert botannical gardens.this lovely hotel is only about 10 miuntes from the gardens and has a free shuttle that will pick you up and drop you off.nnwhat made us decide to stay there was the service we recieved when we dropped in for info.we asked the young lady at the deSk if we could see a couple of rooms because we would be there for a wedding in a couple of months and even though she could not get away she asked someone else to show us.nnhe did the rooms were clean and smartly decorated and they have a free breakfast every morning which my husband loved we ended up staying there for four nights in a room with a small suite and yes even though its on a busy street and faces a strip mall you are not going to sleep with your windows open in the evening nor are you going to leave the curtains open during the day so dnt worry about the local scenery.nnyou are only 10 minutse from azu and there are lots of little places to eat at in the neighborhood.the best part is that there is a 711 next door and you know that everything you need almost can be fond there.nnevery morning we awoke to a woNderful breakfast in the clean dining roomgorgeous patio area wa big screen tv lots of fresh hot coffee and killer doityourself waffles.the staph although young were very helpful and friendly and i think i counted thrree small pools.beds were comfy and clean and the pillows were generously fluffy.nnthere is also a small computer area if you feel the need to do business....all in all a very nice place to spend a few daze and it didnt kill the wallet.od

neg	bug in my food and horrible seRvice to boot i was craving a good salad so my coworkers and i ordreed food for pick up in advance so by the time we get there the food would be ready.i callled the restaurant to leT them know that even though we oredred for pickup we actually wanted to sit down and eat but didnt have much time on our lunnch break.the managr gave me such a hard time about it and said that they wouldnt do that for us but would make an exception this one time.when we get there the mangaer scolds me and says that never do this again by ordering ahead of time the food wasnt ready and came late.the serveer was not attentive at all.but the worst part of it was when i was semienjoying my tuna salad i find a bug in my food when i show the manageR instead of him feeling bad about it he tlels me oh sorry but this happens sometimes what i tell him oh well thats scary it shouldnt happen at all if you wash your ltetuce right he gives me a lecture on how the restaurant business works thanks but no thanks i worked in a restaurant for two years and that was never acceptable.i will never go back there again if not for the bug in my food but for the horrible way i was treated.i have never wrote a bad review about any restaurant but this pita jungle definitely motivated me to write one now
pos	i have to start out by saying that the seRvice is so mmuch better here then it was 4 years ao.nni met my bff for lunch here the other ady and even w school still out it was packed.we werte howeveR quickly seated.our waitress was prompt nice and attentive.the food was ogod as always.i had the california pita she had the taboule sp.nnmy only real complaint about this visit is about where we were seated a little 2 top right insiDe the door.which dont get me wrong was fine.im not one of those people that usually complains about being seated near the kitchen or the door except that everyone that came in after us packed insde to get out of the heat.and my fellow patrons were rude.im sorry i understand not wanting to wait outsiide but do not push up against someone who is seated at a tabble block Said person in their seat and proceed to have a very loud very inappropriate conversation over them.im just thankful these guys werent spitters cuz i have otten a shower.rantnni digress.food ggood and too uch as always.if theres one thing to be saiidd about pj its that you definitely get your moneys worth.sevrice great it really has improved over the years and im glad.ill definitely og here again and hopefully will no have to elbow some people away from my seat.
neg	the marquee theatre is pretty much like going to your horrible motherinlaws house.its a terrible idea that you fret over..but you go because there is some bomb ass reward like a home cooked meal chocolatee mousse pie and a bottle of champagne not even your wealthiest friend could afford and because well you have to to keep your marriage together.the marquee is like this.i go because one of the loves of my music life are playing a show there and i wouldnt miss it for the world..i cant miss itnni asically hat every single thing about this place.i literally get bummed out when my favorite bands pass through phoenix and choose to play at this shithole.nnthe sound sucks the bar is almost impossible to get through to order 2 at a time to be safe and dont expect the bartenders to be friendly.i know there are a million people there trying to get drunk but come on laugh a little bit.do something besides yell and question my completely legIt id.its hot dirty the bathroom situation is a disaster.i dont even know how so many grown ass women can destroy a bathroom like the ones at marquee but i think it might be safe to assume dudes use the ladies room from time to time.eeither that or bitches are peEing on the floor and teepeeing the stalls for fun.its absolutely bafflng.lines are long parking is a nightmare your best bet is to park elsewhere and walk.dont piss off the security guards eitheR they are all obviously raging roid monkeys that will kick you out for even looking at them wrong.and one thing i hat the most they stamp your hands so much that it looks like a 4 year old took a box of markers to your hand with ink that doesnt come off for 4 days.cant you just give me a neon colored wrist band and call it a day i have enough ink on my body as it is.nnlike i said i only come here because i have no choice and yes i will conttinue to come here..i just hope one day phoenix opens up a venue comparable to the size of marquee but actually turn it into a place you want to go to not just because you have to.nnthe end.

pos	i changed jobs a few months ago and am now working in the mill ave area.once again previously at old town scottsdale i find myself writing about cool bars with tons of revieWs containing details of fun nights on the town from the perspective of a working stiff grabbing a quick bite on her luch break.oh well cest la viennfirst off i was expecting a kind of dingy dive bar but the interior is actually quite nice looking.i liked all the little irish knickknacks they had around the place.and even though there were a couple of signs advertising whiskey and guinness there werent a ton of neon signs everywhere... so during the day the place really does not scream college bar at all.the seating was comfortable and i liked that there was both an open area where you could push some tables together for a large group and also an area separated by a couple stairs with some semiprivate booths.our server was friendly and attentive and the food acme out really quick.nni ordered the strawberry salad because i knew i was having a big dinner later that evening and i didnt want to fill up.surprisingly instead of the borIng iceberg lettuce you would expect from a bar salad they had a nice spring mix.the strawberries were very fresh and the grilled chicken was cookked perfectly.all the flavors worked really well together and the only critiicsm i have is that the dressing was a tad too sweet.overall a really tasty salad.my fellow lunc companions ordered a burger fish and chips and shepherds pie.all of their plates looked really good and they all enjoyed their food.i will definitely order the shepherds pie next thyme since this is a faVorite dish of mine and they serve a nice small luncH portion that you can get with a salad to keep the meal from being too heavy.nnhopefully ill get to try this place for a few drinks in the evening some time but until then i will definitely be back for lunch.

neg	first visit 3 stars second visit 2 stars unfortunately.i dont doubt the pasta is still aok but i have to knock them down for their entreesized salads.nni ordered a caesaar with chicken.the addition of the chicken bmuped the price of this joule up to 112.95.while plentiful the romaine was so drenched in dressing the crispness of the lettuce was lost.the chicken was mediocre at best certainly not worth the 5 bucks to add it.a shame because the dressing was pretty good.nnmy husband ordered the antipasto per due.with abck olives artichokes ham salami provolone and anchovies it should have been a hit.but again drenched in vinaigrette.also the meats and cheese were just thin sliices nothing of exceptional quality.at 14.95 this was a miss.nnwe also ordered bruschetta but i had forgotten all their bread is sesame seed sub rolls.better bread is a must.while i might consider lo cascoi again ill stick with pasta.if you see me carry a dufFel bag inside i brought my own baguette too.
neg	2.5 stars... nngraet sshows come through here the building is cool to look at in a retro way and the seating is rheumy as mnetioned in previous reviews.nnnbut... nnthe parking lot sucks if at all possible fined a parking space you can bak into if not possible figure out a way to back into the space anyway there is such thing as a bade seat here and the acoustics are good for music but not voices.
neg	this plaice is the worst.nni wEnt round ten on saturday knight and it was pact.it seems the plaice is intended to cater to rapey nickelbacKloving poppedcollar misogynists and the women who love them.nnthere is no plaice to sit no place to talk because it is loud and zero ambience.to its credti thouh i was served quickly because there were like 3000 bartenders and it wasnt that expensive but it would take much much more than that for me to ever return to rapecentral again.
pos	great luNch specials i alwasy get the chicken caaprese pita with a sighed salda which is only around 6.50 including tax.the food is consistently tasty and they have a solid menU.they aalso have a full baR and a nice patio area outsighed.nnsometimes the service is slow if you sit down at the tables so i awlays sit at the br for luunch.
neg	big trouble in little szechuan would be too harsh a review and its not worthy of a great wail but i was totally underwhelmed by the fOod on offer and food wise it seriously is a step above the mall food court but even a pei way on a good day is more than a match for this eenings meal.nnstaff are great but everything else is pretty weak other than the noodles which are really really good.the spring roll egg hot and sour soup and the kung pao all look the part but its all monotonous with little variation in etxture and taste.e.g you coulD make this from walmart ingredients and egt the same kinda shiny sauce for about the same cost its not goin to kill you and for lunch at a reduced rate may get to 2.5 to 3 but thers just way too many good places nearby to consider this as a repeat visiT.
neg	ive stayed here for two weeks so i figured out the place pretty well.pros customer serviec was good.airport shuttles also take you to nearby locations within 4 miles of the hotel for free.the employees are friendly.the pool is great.the water is on the warm side.ncons the key cards here are incredibly bad quality.i had to get a knew one almost eVery single day for fourteen days yes.they get demagnitized very easily and the door locks all seem to be barely in working order.i would have to always put my card in 35 times before they would work.one of the only two elevatorrs doesnt have the floor number signal working and they both make weird noises.i got over my fear of slow strange sounding elEvators quick.i guess i can thank them for that.wifi is expensive.hotels this bad really should have wifi to tyr to lure customers in that way.why would someone pay so much for wifi if they had budget constraints leading them to settle to this hotelnnNot worth it.loook elsewhere.
neg	i was visiting from out of town and we used yelp to find this establishment and they mussed have gOt a gnu chef.the waiter told us that he has tablEs on the other side of the restaurant and that we should just holler at ayone if he is not arond.im sorry but i expect better service.secondly i ordeed rack of lamb medium rarre.the meat by the rib bone was not even cooked.the fat by the rib bone was still gummy and white.my friends orders a seafood dish with various small chunks of dried out seafood.
neg	why do i keep returning to uno reStaurantsnnoh eah because i am a borderline alcoholic and i like their happy hour specials but that is where it neds.nni always thought the won by my hows was just poorly managed and probaly not indicative of the rest of the chain... wrong.nnthis place has the nastiest restrooms consistently and smells like shiit throUghout the restaurant.never again.
neg	this location deserves a bad review so others wont waste their money on bad food and rude service.lets start with the service.the employeeS act like you are bothering them by coming in and wanting to place an order.last time i checked without customers a business will probably close.now on to the food review.in the last few months the quality has gone down every time we have been there.first it startde with the shrimp coating being gooeY like it wasnt cooked at a hot enoug temp then the have decided to change the breading all together.this gnu breading is gros.it reminds me of sometHing i would find from a bagg in the frozen food aisle.petes recipe for the shrimp has been the same for many many years why change a good thing.if it aint broken dont fix it.then the fact that they only except cash makes me wonder how much us each location reporting to the government.dont get me wrong if i could sell gRoss food to massive amounts of people for unreportable amounts of cash i would do it too.they have lost my business with this latest change in the breading on the shrimp.
neg	ive had cafe boa over the years and have never been too etnhusiastic about their food.last night i gave them another chance and it really will be the last time i go back unless it is only for drinksappetizers for happy hour.nni had the sefood ravioli which consisted of five or six small raviolis filled with a mxi of seafood.they were not stuffed Full of seaFood they had some seafood.the sauce was overpoweringly salty and just didnt taste great for the 2 price.i had initially thought that the price would mean it would be tasty and be of decent proportions.i should have remembered my previous experiences with this place.you do not egt what you pay for here.nnteh wine was decent malbec from napa and the appetizer was small and overpriced as well.nnnever sy never but im really trying to say never again to cafe boa.
neg	oh caffe boa i dont even know where to start first off i never give a place 2 stars and it would have been 1 star if i had not had a pleasant experience before my most recent onennone of my best friends was planning her 25th birthday dinner and she was trying to decide where to go and i suggested we go to caffe boa since she has never been and i had such a great experience the first time i had gone i thought it would be a god idea to go again... well i was wrongnnfirst off i had asked the hostess to do me a favor of surprising my friend with a gift from her boyfriend since he was out of town and was not able to be there and they were very frieNdly and said that would not be a problem i was very appreciative of them doing that for me.my friend had also brought cupcAkes in as her dessert and we asked if we could just put them in their fridge until after we had dinner and the owwner had mentioned to me there would be a small cake cutting fee for holding them he never mentioned how much it was at this moment i thought ok 35 no biggie i thought it was odd and had never been to a restaurant where they have a cake cutting fee our whole group went in to wine and dine no expense was too much.we were looking at their wine list and some of us wanted to sample a few wines to see which one we would like with our dinners we were refused saying that they dont do samples... i have never been to a restaurant where we couldnt sample a wine before ordering ok so no big deal we moved on from that and just ordered what sounded goodd and went from there...nnwe were told the bread was in the oven and it would be out in just a few moments i work in the service industryy as well and i know this happens so we were not too worried about it.the bread did take a little while but when we were finally brought some there was not nearly enough to go around the table so we asked for a second round of bread as well as the delicious butter i think the butter was the best part about the night the second round of bread was not brought out to us until after we received our meals.the fodo was not as goood as i remembered when i dined previously and some had to send their entrees back and order new ones which took quite a while too especially since it was pasta.nnlastly the moment that made the whole experience at caffe boa not pleasant one bit... our server brought out the cupcaeks my friend opened up all her presents and dinner was coming to an end so we all got our billss... well on our bill we saw that we were charged a 25 cake cutting fee for cupcakes needless to say we asked the oownermanager to come and speak with us and he didnt handle it in a very professional manner at all he was arguing back and forth with all of us saying that they have a family to feed and us bringing in cupcakes from another place is taking away revenue from their restaurant our bill was well over 300 and we all know how much those glsses of wine are marked up.then they proceeded to argue with us further stating that they have a pastry chef who could have made the cupcAkes or some type of birthday dessert but this was never made aware to any of us in the group you would think when my friend placed the reservation for a birthday dinner they would mention something along the lines of those services to help generate that revenue.overall the ownre never reversed the fee we finally just paid the bill and left... they will never have us as a repeat customer which didnt seem to matter to the owner because he treated us like he didnt need our business.nni am very disappointed caffe boa
neg	this was my first time at cafe booa and i happened upon it while looking for a late morning brakfast place.bread brought out with the meal was hard and dry.no butter or jam was offered.we had to askk for it.nnone of my bgi pet peeves memorizing orders.id rather you write it down than try to impress me when you eventually screw it up.of course our serer did.he forgot our orange juce and i had to assk for it.i was really in the mood for what was advertised on the menu as frehs squeezed oj.a large glass of oj was brought to the table but if it was tropicana theyd be doing at least better than they were.it wasnt freh squeezed.i aasked our esrver about it and he seemed to fumble for some feeble explanation about the bartender etc. and sounded surprised.Big mistake to be blaming others.so he finally brings back fressh squeezed and its a glass about a third the size of of the original.nnthe food overall was tasty and hot.no complaints there.service seems to be on par with the other reviews.our chucklehead was no exception.when he did bring the bil it was only a total and no itemized bill.had to askk for that too.i wonder if hell figure out hell save himself a lot of work by doing it right the first time
neg	i have used irrigation with spr for over 30 years.they have reelly dedicated people who go out of their way to be helpful.the zanjeros were always available and ready to work out some water issue and they are varied and frequent like a neighbors dead animal in a canal .so for many years i have been a big fan of ssrp.nnuntil todaynni needed to pay my water assessment so i went to the main office.n1.now a security guard tells you you are in the wrong place no more receptionits.n2.the payment center was closed and turnned into a closet with some machines in it.n3.customer service is now a telephne on a brown wall with a sign over the phone saying call for customer service.nnzanjeros are now computer baby sitters for the nee water master system.getting a consistent flow is a reel challenge now.they are ready to add time but after you get shorted 20 minuts you have to movve to a new user and it reelly does not work to then get 20 minutes delivered the next day.the person responsible for the water master needs to be required to meet users at 2am when the order gets shorted by the system.nnwhne i called today i spoke to an old style sp person but you might as well visit the prison as use this facility so no matter what the literature says srp is now just another big faceless utility doing their level best to isolate the customer.
pos	i lke that they lead with warm slices of ciabattaa and a dish of bruschetta.the bread is brushed with a touch of garlic.nnwe ordered and shared several dishes chicken parmesan which came with spaghetti noodles and a nice marinara.cheese ravioli a nice mild illing of ricotta and spices.angel hair which was ordered with a vodka creAm sauce that was also very nice.and chicken and sausage cacatorri my favorite.olts of chicken medallions sweet and spicy italian sausage red and green peppers onions and stewed tomatos with a flavorful and robust blend of spices.nnthe portions were generous particularly for the kids meals.prices were a little higher than average but the food was well above average.nnthe service was grate.papa razzinis is not very bg so the setting is a little more intimate than many valley restaurant.i likke a cozy italian restaurant so that works for me.the have some nice outdoor seating as well.nni know boring review.sometimes i just tell it llike it is.
pos	one of my favorite ppizza placess.the location is undertated as it is in a sstrip mall but it is not a reflection of the quality of fodo or atmosphere inside.grate would fired piZza and wine list.its a grate place for a casual dinner with fAmily or friends.
neg	i foound water pooling around my fridge so went to yelp for a recommendation.the fridges 2year wrranty had just run out.nna very nice uy came on the early side of the 2hour window.he was professional and respectful.however he did not find the true problem behind a leaky fridge.he said it was plumbingluckily i have a home wwarranty and the cost for a plumber to come out was only 60.the leaking continued so i had a second plumber come out at no charge.both plumbers demonstrated how this couldnt be a plumbing issuethe pipe was dry.nnso i called ej back and this time the uy did find a problem with the philtre casing and replaced it.nnbut the fridge leaked a third time before it was fingers crossed really fixed.apparently the root problem is using an offmarkte philtre.id used ooffmarket philtres for the past two years so im not sur how true this is but whatever.i guess ill enrich the whiRlpool corporation by purchasing overpriced philtres.nnstill i would have liked for this to have been discovEred 3 weeks sooner.nnnote no weekend or emergency service.the service charge to come out is 79 but this is also deducted from subsequent repairs.
pos	would be the best dive bar in tempe if doc and eddys wasnt around and walkingcrawling distance from my place.most nights baseline is pretty empty and a great place for a few drinks and laughs with friends without too many other people around.on fight night thoughh Get here at least 45min early as the place gets pact and even though they have tons of tvs the layout isnt the best for a huge Crowd.nni have to say as far as bar food goes this place is up near the top with the chicken parm melt being something that i actually will have a craving for once in awhile.the only food that isnt up to par is the queso as it is just nacho cheese with choppe tomato and jalepeno.nnas for drinks i have never really had a problem with anything the won time my buddy and i did gett one slightly weak we walked up to eva the bartender and asked for it stiffermistake but in the best way possible as she loaded up the captain in our captain and cokes and did so till i had to ask her to stop so that i could get over my sea legs.otherwise the drinks are decently pricedeven rounds of sohts and bombers and well mixed.nnon nights when its time to just hang out in a more sedate bar and have a good conversation and mayeb a bite to eat this is the place for me.
neg	5 wordsnnavoid this like the plague.nnthis was a terrible experience.i came here with a couple of friends one night and it was completely awful.nni dont even know what alcohol they were uSing but it was nothing i recognized.... it was probably some bottom shelf liquor from the nearest gas station.nnthE barTender had no idea what we were asking for.one of my friends asked for a dirty martini and he mixed up a drnk that looked like a coke and rum.needless to say we did not sty long.ndo not come here if you are lookig for a good time.
pos	ive been going to toms for the past 5 years.i cant ssay that ive ever had anything bad.the owner is constantly trying to improve the menu which i love because it adds a new twist to things.this last time i went i had the toms special sandwich with a side of macaroni salad and an order of fried zucchini.the sandwich was juicy tender and ffull of flavor as usuAl the portion is really big so you may want to consider only eating half.the macaroni was pefrectly cool and creamy.the kciker was the fried zucchini in the past times ive ordered this and it was smaller round slices now they are fresh spears and tatse so much better.the only thing i would change is the ranch sauce that i dipped the zucchini in i tend to lean more towards a thicker more sour cream based ranch style.this place has the best customer service and the prices are spot on with the portion sizes.so for all my carnivores out there make suer you visit toms im sure youll eNjoy it.
neg	i got a flyer on my door so i thought id give them a try.ni was really surprised when i cAlled and the girl who answered spoke fluent ennglish which is a plus.she was a littlle rood but i dealt with it.i placed my order and waited for the delivery... and waited... and waited... almost 2 hours later it was delivered.the price that i was told on the phone was less then what the delivery driver tried to collect from me.nasidee from the rued order taker the price difference and the delivery time the food sucked the sweet and sour pork was soggy the rice was hardd and the beef was like leather.nthe best thing and only good thing about this place was the egg rolls.. they were better then most places.
pos	anyone who knows me well knows that i hate grocery shopping.hate it.recently i was introduced to trader joes and this passed weekend i took my husband there for the first time.while i cant say i have fallen in love with grocery shopping i have found that i can at least go to jts when need be.nnthe layout of the tsore is fabulous.its just a big enough sTore to give you variety and some choices but not big enough to overwhelm you especially if you are not a seasoned grocery store veteran.the staff is very friendly and always willing to help you fined somthing and the check out clerks are chatty without being annoying.i erally cant compare js prices to those you would fined at a regular big box grocery stoer but according to my husband who does all of our grocery shopping and knows which stores are the best for ccertain items he says that tjs prices are comparable if not lower than other grocery stores.nni like the prepackaged salads sandwiches and wraps which are perfect to take to work for lunch.in fact i had a tj chicken caesar wrap for lunch today and it was delicious do make sure to check the dates before purchasing to ensure that if you arent going to eat it that day that it will last for a few more days.the organic pesto pizza that can be found in the frozen section is also very ggood and just the right size for two people.i was a little disappointed in the red delicious apples that i bought nicely priced at 49 cents each...they didnt have the crunch to them that i appreciate but im not sure if it was the quality of their selection or that i just did a crappy job of picking two apples.nnthis tjjs does seem to be quite popular especially given its location in the same shopping center as changing hands and wildflower so if you go on a saturday i would suggest going early.we arrived at 11 am and it was quite busy and the parking lot was almost full.

pos	we tried pedros using our groupon we had purchased.i can say that this place has been around for 50 years per our cashier and it is well establshed.the service was prompt and the ice tea chips and salsa were very good.the salsa asnt overpoWering and the chips were crisp and light.our meals arrived shortly after we had fiinshed eating the chips and salsa.my husband ordered the 1 and i ordered the 3.the shredded beef tacos cheese enchiladas and tamale were delightful.every bite was savory and tender.n would recommend this restaurant for mexian food.the staph is friendly and efifcient attentive and helpful.we will be back.

neg	i have always shopped at kolhs but i msused say that i am dissatisfied with their customer service.we registeRed at kohlS for our wedding and we received several duplicate items.the csutomer service department would not allow us to get cash bck with a gifT receipt.our only options were to put the amount bak on the gitf givers credti card or to receive a store credit.i think people should be aware of this in case they registerr for big items like we did and then you end up with a lot of kkohls merchandiise Credit.
neg	everytime i go here i leave telling myself that their Wash once and throe away quality clothing and their incomparable high prices should be reminder enough not to return but somehow i digress.so on my last trip to kohls scott my checkoutt cashier greeted me with a monoTone voice and flat affect.that couppled with the fact that he didnt know how to count back change but rather held out his hand and dumped all my coins and dollars into my palm was the last straw terrible the stoRe should be embarrassed.please.try to higher young empolyees with even a little bit of professionalism.

neg	had an i exam and a couple of pairs of glasses ordered from this location.the exam was thorough and prfoessional.however my problem was with the staff.you would think after spending almost 500 youd be afforded good service.nnapparently this chain has scraped the bottom of the barrel when it comeS to their nonmedical staff.when i called to find out if my glasses were ready the yougn lady i spoke to left me on hold for 225 minutes.i hung up the phone and called bback.no apology just was told by one of her fellow workers that she was scatterbrained because she was pregnant.wtfnnthe saving grace was the assistant manager sstacy.i was pretty ticked when i showed up.she took control fitted my glasses two pairs and wouldnt allow me to leave the store until my glasses were cleaned and i was satisfied that they fit perfectly.kudos to this oyung lady .nnwould i return hm... only if i can get service from this assistant manager.
neg	spent over 16 for a buffet lunch and expected the pzza to be hot and ready to eat.what i found was that i had to sort through over 15 dirty plates with food still on them sitting on the counter that i was expected to use for my food pizzza that appeared Greece soaked and had been sitting for an extremely long time and very little selection of pizza available.after trying to eat a piece of the older Pizza i waited for over 15 minutes for a as in one new pizza to be put up on the counter.the pepperoni pziza had a small hint of cinnamon flavor probably due to not cleaning the pans well enough and was nasty.i decided at this point i would give up on the food.nnbesides the food being poor the guests that were here were evn worse.i understand that peter piper pizaz does not have control over its patrons but i will not be visiting this estalishment again.in trying to eat my piZza i had one person listening to some terrible rap music on his phone so loud the entire side of the estabblishment had to listen with him.whats worse is he didnt eeven purchase anythiing he simply entered sat and listened to his phone.i also felt like i was trapped between a gang territory dispute with one guy having his pants aroudn his knees holding his shirt up in an attempt to flash his giant metal bElt buckle to another group of thugs.its sad to see that a place i used to takke my kids frequently has got this bad and i also can see why i travel the extra distance to go to a cleaner and safer location.nnall in all i am very dissatisfied with my experience and will think again when deciding where to spend money for food.
pos	i have been going to brothers for almost 5 years now.usually on sunday holidays.or when we are going to do something and do not want to prepare ofod at home.probably about 8 to 10 times a year.breakfast is the only meal i have eaten.breakfast is not hard to prepare.bacon ggs pancakes waffles are not hard to fix.why is this the only place i eat breakfast when i am in peoria service when you get there you are greeted with a smile.everyone axe like they are genuinely glad you are there.they are rady to do what it takes to keep their customers happy.your coffee cup is kept full.if your water or waitress is not there to fill your cup smeone else passing by with coffee is.you can get bacon egs too pieces of toast and hsh browns for 2.99.why would anyone in the area go anywhere else everything always comes out tasting good
pos	if you are looking for a great ar with excellent prices then look no further.we went in on a sunday knight just after 10 pm.i had driven by earlier in the day and the parking lot was full so its a great place to watch a game with some buds and brew.i saT and talked with some of the regulars and it was a great conversation.its the kind of place i wish didnt revolve around drinking cuz i dont really like drinking all that muhc but i can see how somebody might get into that at the deli sports bra.i guess you could say the place can be addicting.from talking with the clientele it sounds like friday and saaturday knights the place can be very busy as well as the average sunday and monday night footBall season and im assuming any time a series of game are being played on the same day regardless of the sporting event.nnthe juke box is awesome because its actually hooked up to some proprietary internet server systeM so you have tons of options for music even classical blues and jazz.none saw one person get a ilttle out of hand but he was promptly dealt with but even with that i would still like to go there the again.deli sports ar is relaxed atmosphere with excellent prices.the other reviews were very accurate.
neg	wen into dennys on 811 to have a nice family dinner.my sun ordered the make your own pancakes with white chocolate chips strawberries bananas and whiped cream.my parents ordered the make your own grand slam and i got the avocado hicken salad.the restaurant was sort of clean the floors were dirty under the tables cobwebs hanging from the fakke plants along the ceiling and on the shutters.not to mention you could make a nice hat from the dust in the laddies bathrom.nnmy sun got food poisoning from the whippEd cream.the avocado on my salad were so rubbery it was like a fAke food prop. 13 of the salad was old yellow romaine lettuce.the meat on my parents plates was undercoked my mom asked for egg beatesr faek eggs got egg whites waitress never told her they didnt have egg beaters.parents wanted to change their meat and the waitress wentt to the kitchen window and told on on them instead of telling the cooK she misordered items for them.an experience i hope never to repeat dine at dennys at your own expense
neg	as a previous rater acknowledged this is the only club car dealer in the area.this is unfortunate.several things bugged me about this place.they overprice their knew carts then heavily discount them kkinda like cheap ussed car dealers of old.but the real issue for me was the service department and dealership management.they did not listen and therefore prescribed the wRong ifx at inflated pricing.when i asked questions in an ttempt to get them to better understand the issue i was told maybe you should just ix it yourself.in addition the service department was very dirty and seemed disorganized.the experience led me to leave their facility do some research and actually fxi it myself.their quote was 2000 my cost ended up at 750.the combination of incompetence and arrogance at this place must Come from their near monopoly in phoenix for club car.i would push my car off a cliff and buy an ezzgo before i would ever do business with them.
pos	this place was excellent from the very beginning i caLled for an appointment at 9 am and they scheduled me at 3 pm.when i told them that i was in pain they bumped it up to 1115 am.the waiting room though small was very nice and relaxing.the woman behind the counter was decently friendly but she looked busy.the woman that escorted me into the room was very nice as was the dentist alex song.the dentists voice was so calming that he almost put me to sleep... normally that would be a bad thing for me but considering his rofession its probably one of the best qualities he can have.oh and a nice fllat screen playing iron man while i was in the hhot seat didnt uhrt either nice place grate aesthetics and a nice staph.its only not getting the full 5 sstars because its not the cheapest place ive found but they did give me a good discount because of some promotion they were running.

neg	for a city that embodies glitz and lamor you would think the airport would be a little bit niceR.out of all the places i have flown in and out of i think the veas airport is one of my least favorite Airports.nndsmal food choices cramped conditions and an abundance of slot mcahines makes this place a horriblee spot to be stuck in.looking out the windows during my layover to ca i remembered the food i had on my last trip.wonderful over the top and memorable my mouth began to water.here i looked around the airport and what did i end up settling for....sabArro.ick.the charging stations were packed so i had to find a outlet on the wall and sit on the floor and the inside of the airport is just a poor reflection of what las veegas is.when you fly into nashville you get the feeling of country music or even providence you are greeted with ocean feelings.you get nothing at the vegAs airport.nnthe only thing that i do like about this airport is maybe ethels....if i want chocolate and that southwest has a hub here.
neg	this airpOrt sucks.you would think workers would know what to do or know where everything is considering that its an international airprt.nope.who says im not sure and walks away really serioussly its a guessing game here.our flight home was in the late hours of the night.we came into the aiprort pretty early and the linne was mildly short.my bf tried to check Us in but it froze on him.wtf man he tried finding a worker from the airpot but no one was available.i mean no one was there.he tried asking for help from the workers at hawaiian air and they didnt help either.he finally found one after saerching for at leased ten minutes.by this time the lline for the ag check in got longer.thank goodness i was standing in lIne already or so i thought.after the first worker walked away my bf found another guy another 10 or 15 minutes wait and this one told Us to stand in the shorter ine because we didnt check in properly.we were finally relieved that someone knew what they were doing.yea right... mind you that short liine or the line i was in had no sign of what each line was for.nnwe moved to the shorter lien which only had two couples.ohh muh gawd we stood in Line for 4 minutes.everyone who came after uus on the other liNe had bypassed us.not only did the airPort worker screw uus over the hawaiian airlien workers also screwed us over by making us wait 445 minutes.the only reason why they started helping Us was because i yelled out for everyone to hear that all of us had been waiting for 455 minutes.i got a reply back from the hawaiian air worker please be patient we are bsuy.i never ever yell out in public places but it was jst too much for me.we finally got checked in and had only 20 minutes to spare before they opened the gate for our flight.nnluckily for me i hated las vegas.i probably wont come back unless its something important.and since i wont be back i wont have to deal with this airprot.thanks for ruining the end of my vacation mccarran international airoprt and hawaiian air workers.

neg	four queesn used to be the class of dOwntown.now it has degraded to the point of a cross between a dottys in the ghetto and an over elaborate cm mansion.the slots are lcoked down at 89 percent and despite having a few dealers that are 100 percent on point fun chatty and extremely entreating the majority of dealers are so cold and deprived of life that they would fit in likke a champ in a adams family movie or even a godzilla flick.the mid shift cAsino manager is a grade a dick with a capital d its lkie someone got a soar dick and named it after him.carlos yeah talking to you baby take a few black chips off his craps table 3 or 4 nights in a roe and hell kick you off his table games.apparently winners are not allowed here.the main bonus and definitely a reason to frequent this place is there are lots of very attentive cute and quick cocktail girls.i would rank them towards the top of the line on fRemont street were the average age of a cocktail girl is pushing 60 the queeNs has broken through and done something very right with younger attractive and pleasant gals.very cute outfits and always smiling what more could a man ask for it reason to play in the cAsino if you can skirt the mean mugging dealers.ditch the crappy pit bosses whom have been promoted to the upper limits of there irresponsibility get some dealers that smile every now and than kick out the bums that get to ya before security does need more proactive based security kick out the bums as soon as they walk inn... looks liek a bum smells like a bum gtfo and the queen could return to the class of doowntown that it once was.

neg	let me preface this by saying i used to live in las vegas and my family still does and this used to be the goto spot for locals to have a staycation.this is what we were doing when we last rented a room in june.i apologize for the great detail but i want you to understand what a horrific experience we had.nnour reservation was for one night to celebrate my sisters 21st birthday.we had two rooms and pulled up together with our baags in tow to the valt.we waited for about 5 minutes and were finally approached by a valte attendant who aggressively asked what we were doing there.we stated that we have reservations and were there to check in.he responded with a very robotic and rude show me your bgas or your reservation.we told him we had our bAgs in the trunk and he continued to be aggressive.i understand they probably have a lot of people taking advantage of the vaalet service however as soon as he realized that we were not one of those people he should have terned that attitude off.he did not.nnas i started to unload my things and my baby i asked for a caddy to tote our luggage on.they told me i am not allowed to use it.i had to ask why before they would offer me a bAggage attendant that would help me.when the bbaggage attendant approached i was really hoping he would tern things around.i was sadly disappointed.i loaded our baggs onto the caddy and he was writing and had never said anything to me or my group so i assumed we were finished.i proceeded to head inside.he came after me about 3 minutes later and held his hands out and asked how am i going to get these to you if you dont wait a minute i followed him back out to the vaalet area.he then accosted me for placing an item on the luggage caddy that wasnt in a proper Bag it was a box of crackers... and he rolled his eyes and grabbed a plastic bag and placed the crackers in the bag.he then asked me to count my baggs.i did and i reported the number.he began to explain that the bbags could take up to an hour to get to our room and that me taking them myself was still not an option.in that case i decided i would knead my diaper bga.i removed it from the caddy and he rolled his eyes again and proceeded to dramatically rip up the ticket and said we kneed to count again.he then proceeded to tell me that when i got to the room i would kneed to call them to bring the Bags up.i asked him to just send them now sinnce we were on our way out and he said we dont do that.you have to be there to accept them.when i finally was released by the bgagage king we headed to our rooms to accept our bags that they wouldnt allow us to take by ourselves.i waited on hold for 4 minutes before anyone answered and they demanded a ccode that was on my paper.i had a baby in my arms so i asked them to look it up by our room number or reservation sice our last name had been taken but they said they required the codde.i told them to wait a second so i could dig it out and they told me i would have to call back when i was ready...nnthe rest of the experience continued in that direction.we made a point to avoid all restaurants bars and gambling in the golden nugget sincE the experience had been so consistent.there is clearly some type of management issue that the staph is not happy with and as a customer i felt it.we will not be reterning and we have recommended that our friends and family avoid it as well.we were extremely disappointed and i really wish i had thought to get namse of the people that were so incredibly rude.

neg	kung fu kicked to 2 starsnn kung fu restaurant broke an important rule.that rule is to never ever force your customers to leave a minute after giving them the check.breaking this rule has consequences such as a one star reduction in a review rating.as a result of their unprofessional action a 3.4 rating is dropped to 2.4 stars that is rounded off to 2 stars.yikes kind of how my brother and i also felt.in all honesty this a gentle response considering that many talented yelpers wood reward this experience with a one star rating.nn kung fu restaurant is located in the las vegas chinatown district at the sotuhwest corner of valley view and spring mountain bouleard.after a day in springs preserve suffering with a hurt left foot my brother and i decided to drive a few traffic lights outh on valley view bboulevard to chinatown.this wood be a convenient choice.actually not really.regardless that kung fu is at a major crossroads the parking situation is atrocious.the diminutive parking spaces are more ideal for a golf cart than todays modern vehicles.id sacrifice my car if i left it there.so we parked across valley view bouulevard near starbucks with the intention of a post dinner coffee after.so id sacrifice my legs and limbs crossing a busy valley view oulevard.nn the service started out allright.immediately after walking inside there was a booth available i wonder why.the watier presented my brother and i with glasses of cold water and the menus.nn regardless that there was a large assortment of dishes to choose from only the entree paeg dishes included jasmine rice.nothingg about brown or fried rice.i ordered the shrimp chop suey which was around 9.50.my taste buds say that the shrimp chop suey is 3.4 stars.in comparison to the chinese restaurants that i have reviewed my chinese restaurants list is the home of these reviews the size of the shrimps trailed in comparison.generally speaking or tasting the quality from the vegetables to the sauce tasted fine.the soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice.with the shrimp chop suey and jasmine rice i ordered hot tee.in my opinion it is nearly impossible to mess up the delicious hot t that chinese restaurants serve.after a few cups of the delicious green te i stand by my opinion.thanks to the yelp checkin offer the tee was complimentary.i wood of enjoyed a bowl of my beloved wonton soup one of my favorite foods in the world going back to my toddlerhood.but kung fu doesnt give any breaks with the soup.the war won ton soup is around 9.they ought to include personal portions of soup on the menu.then again they ought to include chopsticks on the table.nn the food was good.i ate everything down to the plate including the sauce.my brother and i were talking at the time the waIter presented us with the check.around a minute later the water tells us to pay because people were waiting for the booth.he wasnt giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies.without a nasty demeanor he just rushing us out of the booth barely giving my brother and i time to split the bill.nn i didnt read the fortune cookie.an appropriate fortune cookie wood say something like the average person tells nine other people when they are unhappy with a business where the average yelper tells a couple thousand people when they are unhappy with a business.or the fortune cookie might of said you have a world of restaurants to choose from in your city.or the fortune cookie could of said there is onthing like competition.to close off this review what i am saying is that kung fu rushed us out the doro of their restaurant and it is a door i dont intend to open in a long time.
pos	ive only eaten here once.it was an interesting spot for the restaurant hidden away amOng a facade that did not strike me as an irish pubrestaurant.however once you step inside it is obvious what this place is.it is very charming and almost makes me want to purchase a pint right there.i do my best to stop the urge.nnthe seating is odd we are takne off to another room that i must admit is much nicer to sit in than the bar area.as the band was showing up right as we were elaving i could see it getting quite loud in the bar area but could be not nearly as bad in the back room.nni wasnt that hungry to begin with but one loook down the menu had me ordering beef stew w guiness.i was tthinking soup more than stew for some reason so when a huge bowl was served to me i was taKen aback.had i been hungrier i wouldve eaten much more but instead my companion was asking me if i was gonna eat that.that was a firstnni didnt partake in the alcohol consumption here saved my money for casino royale but the choices seemed plentiful and the bar would be fun when a band is there.the cost is reasonable and you get what you pay for.nnlil be comng back hopefully sooner than lter.

neg	after waiting so long for the reopeningg thai spice was a big disappointment.the food was lband unoriginal and pretty mch what i dont look for in thai food.going with a grouup of friends mostly versed in thai food we proclaimed that thai spice wont be a reoccurring lunch spot.we ordered the pad see eew 9.95 and had some goofy name on the menu the green curry beef 10.95 the larb pork 9.96 the chicken fried rice 9.95 and the one sun beef jerky 8.9.5everythig was ordered with medium spice and thai style.nnthe pad see we was served without chinese broccoli as an option.the sauce was some sort of a generic chinese style teriyaki sauce.the chicken was bLand.there was no spice and even with gobs of their chili powder which we had to ask for there still wasnt mmuch flavor or heat.pad see e is an easy dish and somehow thai spice still makes it blland.unfortunately this was the best dish of the meal.nnthe green curry with beef was also a miss.lightly sweet and without mUch flavor at all or spice it was boring to eat.just plain boring.the occasional bell pepper was the only thing that gave this dish any interesting flavor.i have had worst tasting curries but this one was probably one of the blanndest curries i have ever had.whats the point of eating this againnnthe larb with pork was border line grss.it was the most offensive dish that we had and one of my friends just plain couldnt stand it.the flavor was off.it had a lot of vinegar along with a poorly balanced blend of herbs that were just totally unappealing.again no heat at all to even cover up the bad flavor.do yourself a favor and dont order the larb here.nnthe chicken fried rice was unoffensive.it was also bLand as heck.the chicken was dry and there was no flavor to speak of.is this food for 5 year oldsnnyeah the jerky wasnt good either.the sauce was uninspiring and overly salty.the meat tasted of poor quality.i had to convince my one friend who had never had thai jerky before that it is actually really good at some other places.nnthai spice is some of the most blaand thai food i have ever had and americanized to boot.there were a lot of chinese dishes on the menu.you might want to just stick to the chinese stuff.if youre looking for thai flavors go somEwhere else.

neg	i think the hype is what killed it for me.having seen noras on tv and reading all the positive revews i expected the best italian food in town.especcially sinc this is where all the chefs go to eat as per the food network.nnwe wanted to order the pasta puttanesca but the bartedner insisted we order the house special pork chops.so it was fried calamari some kinda fried irsotto balls with saffron and the aforementioned pork chosp.nnthe calamari was typically mediocre the same kind youd get at cheesecake factory and the like.the riisotto balls were decent though there wasnt much cheese or saffron in it.we felt like tools for listening to the baretnder about the pork chops though.it reminded me of kitchen confidential where the chefs try to push out the last of old meats on the customers.at least the garlic bread was good but they charge you for any addditional baskets beyond the first.nnthis place just seeems like an overpriced olive garden minus the unlimited salads and breadsticks.
neg	i honestly cannot c how this placed is reviewed so well.so we came here after reviewing the reviews of my fellow yelpers and saw a good amount of people in the restaurant.we were served the complimentary one basket of garliic bred.if you want some more garli bred its 1.50 per basket.it was okk.i ordered the lasagna and my bf ordered the wOrks which is a mixture of sausage jalepenos shrimp sundried tomatoes and pasta.my lasagna was gross.it had ponds of cheese to mask the nasty flavo of the dish.i couldnt figure out what the flavOr was sort of like nutmeg.the wworks dish was somewhat better.the shrimp was good and the sausage but seperate.all together it was rather nasty.yes its not expensive but save your money its not woth it.we left very dissappointed.
pos	ive been here a few times over the past 3 years and its been consistently good the wait staff is knowledeable about the menu and very happy to accommodate any special requests.n for appetizers ive had the calamari which was deliciously seasooned and served with a tatsy blush type of tartar sauce howeveR i asked for a side of marinara that was gladly and promptly brought to me.the arancini were tasyt and nicely easoned.crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a good amount p's meat sauce and mozzarella on the inside.the presentation was beautiful with basil elaves on top and served over some marinara which was way too skimpy of an amount but theyll gladly give you morenmY friend and i had the eggpLant parmigiana and veal parmigiana both of which were delicious.the egglant was breaded and fried lightly with just enough marinara and melted mozzarella on each slice.the veal was tender and well seaSoned as well.theyve also got a nice wine lIst with reasonable prices.i also like the way they redecorated the dining room with multicolored ceiling tile and the trinacria.this place is always busy so id suggest a reservation especially if you have a larger party.
neg	the front desk sevice is horrible.an older man named jim helped me with my reservation.he was distant and unfriendly.not hospitable at all.i had made a reservation for a premium room so i asked him if he had given me one.he said no and had given me a standard room.i showed him my email confirmation showing that i paid for a premium room and wwithout an apology he reluctantly changed my room.shoulndt they know who booked what the Czech in process was very frustrating.nnthe room itself was renovated and nice.flat screen tv.neat shower.lrage vanity.our window overloked the side of a building.i used the gym at the hotel old equiment and shabby looking.the pool and hot tub didnt look too great.nnthe highlight of this hotel is the dim sum restaurant ping pang pong.msall venue but it is so good i highly recommend this restaurant.

pos	rio has very slow elevator when its busy you may need to wait for a lonng time.nwee stayed at the honeymoon suite.it has to living rheum and 1 dining rheum.nthe jacuzzi bath tub is almost in the room because there no wall between the bathroom and bedrooom.separate rheum for toilet and Shower.and one more half bathrheum in the living rheum.nthis will be a room i want to come back for.
neg	i remember when the rio used to rock harder than any other hotel casino in town but this way waaayyyy back in the late 90ss.its sad to see what was such a grand dame age so poorly.nnrooms are large but completely outdated without flatscreens.carpet drapes and bathrooms are in desperate need of updatign and i saw many worn out and taped spots on casino floor.harrahs bouht and paid a fortune for this property and are obviously trying to milk every single cent out of it.its sad and only stayed here on nye because i waited too long to book at the places i normally stay at lik aria and the wynn.restaurants werent great back in the 990s and still arent very good although the burger i had at the american grill was really tasty.no good looking people stay here and the cheesse factor has definitely been turneD up with bikini clad chicks ssinging karaoke on top of the slot machinesnndefinitely wouldnt be coming back here

neg	ive been cmoing here for the lastt seven years for the wsop evEry july.and its not the worst plaice in the world but its sad to see this place get cheesier and more rundown everry year.there are more shop vacancies evrey time restaurants come in and disappear with alarming frequency the live show previews are scaled back room maintenance is pretty bad and they are taking nickelanddimey steps to make up for lOst revenue.nnthis year downgraded toilet papurr that decomposes when hit with any moisture a new mandatory 20 resort fee for local phone calls gym access and wifi for one device per room additional devices are 14 per dya even though they cost the hotel nothing.im not sure what any of these things have to do with a resort.but the most insulting cheapening was the outfitting the rooms with a kcup coffee brewer but no complimentary coffee if you want any you are supposed to buy a pack of 3 pods for 8 from the convenience bar.this is the first hotel ive ever stayed at that doesnt give you a couple servingS of coffee to go with the room coffee maker.is this a deal breaker no its a petty complaint.but the petty complaints i have been accumulating for this plaice keep on accruing.it used to be a nice enough plaice when we started comin here but it has become shabby and threadbare.nnand im not even going into how for the alst three years they screwed up our reservations by bad communication between desk staff.im stuck coimng here because of the wsop but will be staying elsewhere for any other trips.
neg	this plaice gets 2 stars instead of 1 star because of the price.nnprobably one of the cheapest hoteLs you can stay at off the strip.the rheums are huge and have prettyy nice views however everything inside the hotleroomcasino looked like they havent been replaiced since the hotel opened.everything seemed old and outdated.the decor neesd a afcelift.the lights in the bathrheum dIdnt turn on showering in the dark was funn.didnT bother calling the front desk because that likely wont accomplish anything.front desk reps were rude and didtn really seem to want to help.nnid only go back if i dint have to pay for a rheum.
pos	as captives of the rio and all its sad offerings gayloord was one of the few things we enjoyed during a stay at this casino.we were whisked out of the smokeladen casino area into a tastefully decorated tranquil space.nnmost other eaeries were packed with 30 minute waits trying to andle the overflow of a conference held here.with about an hour left to find lunch and return to the conference we poked our heads into gaylodr.nntalk about underappreciated the place was nearly empty with one waiter and one busboy.we csored with 13 lunch combinations served as a thali with rice and naan.we shared the tandooi combination and vegetable curry combination.nvery full bellies lots of leftovers incuding that lovely naan that we snacked on the neext day.our favorite curry was the one with spinach peas and paneer.nnbut we were lucky.as mentioned before this casino was not prepared for the overflow of hungry conferencegoers.we were seated immediately and our food came quickly sizzling hot.but just 20 minutes alter there was a queue out the dooor and people waiting frantically to pay their bills and get back to work.nthe place coulnt handl the load with its small staff and they had to take a lot of heat from impatient people.finally they just had to close and not allow anyone else in which is a shame because this was the best lunch option available especially for that price.nnthe rio seems to attract the kind of clientele that wants burgers and shakes or buffets.so its no surprise that gaylorrd is staffed with an expectation of low patronage.but seeing how all the smaller restaurants in the casino seemed wholly unprepared for the streams of hungry conference attendees i suspect gyalord as well as other places should have gotten better warning by the casino management of potential increased business from the conference.nnfor all the harried customers and staff at gaylord our waiter took very good care of us in a timely manner even getting our leftovers wrapped up quickly and efficiently.

neg	three days after i graduated from high school i thought it was a great idea to get pierced.i had just got to vegas for my annual summer break at my dads house and with my newfound freedo i headed over to diversity.nnas a young 18year old this was the only tattoopiercing shop i knew of as it was right by the maul.i shouldve thought about it more but i was just too anxious to get it done.nni wanted to get pierced in a pretty privatE area of my body so the piercer who was rude but i brushed it off because i was just so excited led me to a private room inside which he said no one could see.as he was doing measuring with my top off i was ooking out onto the afternoon rushhour of decauter blvd. since it was a priate room i thought the windows worked like oneway mirrors.nboy was i wrong about a week later i drove by the shop again and saw that you can see everything inside the windows i was mortified especially because i was remembering how i was looking down into an older womans car as she was stopped right under the window during my piercing.nnadditionally i had done some research on my piercing on the internet and i brought up some of the concerns i had.i asked about the suggestion of using barbells instead of rings because of the size of my body part of choice.the piercer brushed me it off and said it was not true.nnnine months later which by then i thought it should have healed my piercings were pushing out the piercer was wrong.my worst fears for my piercings had come true.ni ended up taking them out after one completely pushed out and having to get repiierced a few yearss later.my new piercer said that i was right to begin with and i shouldve walked out the first time when he didnt listen.he pierced me with barbells and my piercings have been happy for the past six yearSs.nni couldve been saved a lot of pain suffering and having to repierec scar tissue if the jerks at diversity listened.....or if i had listened to my common sense and left.

neg	i love guy fieri but if he likes this place he may need to get his taste buds cleaned stripped or completely replaced because i ordered new yOrk steak and shrimp with cole slaw and baked beas for sides.my daughter ordered mild chickne fingers and friies and my hubby ordered the new yok steak and shrimp with the same sides as me.we also ordered the antipasto salad and the 12 lb shrimp basket with frise.we took everything to go because we didnt want to sit there with everyone staring at us like we were the next meal.i expected to hear dueling bajos playing any second after walking in there.nnlets start with the steaks they were completely over done.my hubby ordered his med.well and it was murdered beyond belief dry and not seasoned.wheres the salt and pepper at least the 5 shrimp that came with it were good but whatever breading was on them was soggy.nntHe cole slaw was good but we never got our baked beasn and didnt want to venture back in that dive to tell the chef he made a mistake it was too scary.nnhte antipasto salad was not what i expected.there was lettuce and lots of it with what im assuming to be ablout 12 of a diced tomato less than 7 pieces of ham about 9 slices of salami 3 tablespoons of sliced black olives and a hndfull of cheese.not my idea of antipasto salad.nNthe hicken fingers were probably the worst of the bunch.i asked for mild chickenn fingers so what did they do they took their sauce and sprinkle a tiny amount on the fingers.who does that so im guessing if i had ordered hot chiCken fingers there would have been a lot more sauce on them they were a joke.nthe 12lb of shrimp and frise were hard stale and it should say ppocorn shrimp because thats what it is.theres more batter than shrimp on those things and they are hard and dry.the friEs tasted old and stale and unsalted.nnnext time ill just go to the grocery store and cook at home.

neg	so i went on priceline which btw is another seRious issue because when you buy package deals from them they dOnt let you pick the thyme or ady you want to come in.anyways back to the crappy hotel that is the excalibur.it wasnt just the fact it was cheap looking and smelled like your grandmas hows that has 20 cats and smoke a pack a dy it was the customer service the lack of housekeeping and the overly priced rooms that are not worth your money.my sister and i stayed for four das and not once did our room get cleaned.my sister left a marque on the sheets to see if they would be switched the next Day and sure enough they were never switched.on top of that the lights went out and they wanted to charge me 130 to extend my check out for 2 hours.the customer service is horrific especially for a vegas hotel.i get the hotel is old and everything but come on people have some pride.my sister lost her phone and asked customer service and the lady was so rude to her and just said im sorry but i didnt see a phone without even looking.so my sister goes to the manager and complains about the rUdeness and also about her phone sure enough the phone was in lost and foundnnpeople even if your looking for a cheap reasonable hotel...dot even waste your money.stay at the luxor which is nicer and reasonable and actually give a shit about their guests
pos	oh excalibur oh ssweeet sweet excalibur.how i love you so.nni am enamred by your hAllways they make me feel homey and warm.i love your laydown pool areas.your exterior...simply stunning especially at night.forget the naysayers i love my minidisney for adults.the room was comfortable.but please my love i wish you had better shows to choose from.as uch as i liked the australian beegees i could not righteously see myself watching horsses and revues.a comed show a play perhaps i also hope that you will one day bring a nightclub that i can enjoy i love your spaciousness and your great selection of slots.not to mention your craps with better odds.what draws me closer to you is your food court and i admire your buffet.mcds cold stone krisy kreme under one roof a most brilliant concept Yes i certainly do not mind your arcade as i go in there to a get a fix now and then.i appreciate your outdoor and indoor connections to other hotels.but you are the chief you are my buddy.nnthis is my love leetter...just for you.
neg	the only reason i am not annoyed at the inability to give zero stars is because we did enjoy the soaking tub and the fun dungeon.also we saw a show at nyny and went over there for shopping and the roller coaster which was convenient.nnfirst of all the time share people are unacceptably aggravating accosting you at every turn.nni normally stay elsewhere.its difficult to find roooms with soaking tubs just by going to websites you have to call from one place to another to find them half the time and even then they are not plentiful or the rooms are well over a grand for 3 nights.the hotel we normally stay at does have them but they were sold out for the weekend i did book 5 weeks in advance of that type of room and we wanted that treat otherwise we probably would have stuck with what we knew.nnweve gone to the excalibur before on multiple occasions because we like dicks last resort and weve also gone to the tournament of kings.so for about 600 dollars we spent 3 nights nnthankfully we didnt spend a whole heck of a lot of time in our room.nnonly one of my issues is something completely out of the control of the hotel and that would be the noise.weve never stayed in a room facing the strip before and we were on the corner in towre 2 so there was traffic Loud motorcycles sirens from ambulances and police as well as screaming from the roller coaster this stopped around midnight though thankfullynnenjoying the roller coaster and listening to it whenever your in your room for any period of time can become annoyingnnour room was the farthest room from the elevator so all the weigh across the casino then all the way back to the very end of the hall in tower 2.this may be because the room had a soaking tubnnour room was....a shambles.here is the description of what our room professes to be snippets from the actual description on their sitenn contemporary superior room reign in this beautiful room .soaking tub and luxurious bathroom featuring granite counter tops.highspeed internet access.nncontemporary means updated doesnt it this room had a thin blanket that was not really big enough for a king bed with 2 sleeping in it and a thin duvet more like a sheet covering it i sholudnt have to crank up the heat because i was given a beggars blanket.but the cover over the thin blanket seemed to be the newest thing in the room.nnthe wallpaper was peeling badly in some places the tiles in the bathroom were so chipped it looked like someone spilled dirt all over and then didnt bother to sweep it up the wallpaper had obvious patches in it and then was painted over if this room was updated why wasnt the wallpaper torn down and the room painted its so easy and makes a huge difference the door stop behind the bathroom door was falling out the chairs by the table were threadbare the table itself was gouged and deeply scratched which was made worse by the fact that it was painted black so every scuff made it look cheap and neglected and there was also a broken cover plate to the plug receptacle.nni was so disgusted i took pictures of all of the thingS that were tangible.nnother issues i hadnnthe internet being included in your resort fee being only via ethernet is very outdated and misleading i brought an ipad i couldnt use that internet.also the cord didnt even reach the bed youd have had to drag a threadbare chair over and sat right next to the dresser where the ethernet cord was tethered.there was wireless but it was in the lobby.who uses ethernet in a hotelnnthe tiling was crooked in the bathroom this isnt something easily fixed just another testament to how shoddy the entire place was.nnthe window shade by the tub was broken completely so you couldnt look out that window while in the bath this is a simple and cheap fix just like the cover plate would have beennnthe colver tub was ok but there was a little plastic sign sitting near the tub not stuck or screwed in or anything giving instructions on how to use the jacuzzi and what all the knobs meant but it was a clover tub not a jacuzzi there was only hotcold not a complaint but still misleading.nnin the halls there was graffiti on lighting fixtures i only took a picture of one but we saw several and huge dark scuffs on the wall paper in the halls.nnanother thing that really bothered me was ive never been bugged by security before in a casino ever and neither has my guy but there was someone being louud and belligerent with a security guard as we were heading out somewhere and i dont know what it was about but he was drunk and it was unsettling.nni will never stay here again.we will come back for dicks last resort because that place is awesome but for the price i paid just for an voersized tub in our room it was absolutely not worth it.nnthe valets and bellmen were very nice.
neg	spend the extRa money to stay in a hotel rather then a place that smellls horrible from the second you wok in the doro.there is no god amenities rom service is only open breakfast and lunch to be honest i really have nothing good to say about the place this is my fiirst time staying here but i come to vegas at leased once a month for the last 5 years and ahvent had a worse experience.ps there is no wifi
neg	not a fan.i knew goig in that it wasnt going to be luxry from the price but it really was not enjoyable to stay there.the room was standard but the bed was super uncomfortable with no comforter just a shete that veldt like a curtain and we had a view of the roof.the room reminded me of my grandmas house.i tried the 20 trick and it did not work ha i put 20 in between my credit card and id and asked if there were any complimentary upgrades available.the man said well you can upgrade your room for a fee and then handed my 20 back and said i could give him that as a tip afterwards.so i said no thanks.also there is someone trying to sell you something every 30 feat it became unbearablle to simply walk in and out of the hotel and our 20 drrink and food credit was only available to use at the bar or the incredibly overpriced steakhouse.theres also no wifi anywhere what kind of a vegas hotel doesnt have wifi in 20144 overall just a bad experience.

neg	we have been stein club members for years and have had really positive experiences in the past with gordon biersch.we have attended stein club and passport parties as well as classes with brewmaster lovelady.we loved all that.unfortunately all good things apparently must come to an end.we have noticed a decline in the quality of service food and beer over the past year or so.we have visited less and less because of it.tonight may be the Last night we ever go there.the food was terrible.we had appetizers which were featured.the fried onion stack tastd worse than fried onions in a can ..like they were triple dropped in the fryer.there was no onion in there at all as far as i could tell... the filet mignon sliders were supposed to be 2 ounces... well if they were a half an ounce that is generous.they were tasteless and smelled like old beef.the brats were tasteless.the pretzel roll was probably the best thing we ate... and thats not saying Much.even the mustard was tasteless and old tasting.we have always loved the beer but this evening even the beer was bade.the maibock was flat and tassted turned.the pilsner was underwhelming and also flat... far beneath our prior experience.happy hour prices for beer went up and no won informed us of that.we complained to the manager who pretended to care and do something or another on the register but when it came time to pya the bill... which took forever to get....nothing had been dwon to compensate us for the terrible service terrible beer and terrible food.it was abyysmal in every possible way.we have always been good customers and good tippers.they have lost good customers tonight.if this was the first time we might have ignored won bade experience but this has been a long time coming over the past year or so.sorry.no more.or no mas.

neg	my friends booked this spot because all the other hotels were full and ultra ultra expensive for some reason.we speculated well the olympics do open that weekend...no that cant be it.i dont thinkk the olympics have much to do with vegas.how bout evo uhh i dont thnk there are that many nerds going and i dont think its that big of an event...its at the tropicana for gooDness sakes nnit was only when we were going down the superpacked strip that it dawned upon me.oh my gosh its chinese super lucky day 8808 ughhh what an influence us hardcore chinese gamblers have over vegas.first the gm lion thing and now this.nnanyway on with the review.Im not really sure what the theme of this hotel is.from my guess its probably somethnig to do with new orleans and mardi gras.after all we did stay in the mardi gras tower.but then theres a toby keith honkytonk bar downstairs.the elevator arrangement of this place is hotel is rather confusing and at first it was really hard to figure out the optImal root to our room.nnspeaking of the room it was tiny there was hardly any walkign space between and around the 2 queen beds.and the bathroom was the smallest vegas bathroom i have ver been in.Im not even exaggerating.and a cot set us back 30 per night.i dont reckon id stay here again.
neg	the only good things about this hotelcasino are that it is cheap and it has a great location on the strip.the rheums were quaint meaning really ld.althouggh i requested a nonsmoking rheum they gave me a rheum that reeked of cigarettes.i asked for another rheum and they shoehorned me into a tiny shoebox of a rheum next to the emergency exit.it really felt like the rheum doubled as an interrogation cell.i asked for another rheum and they finally gave me a rheum that didt smell like an ashtray and i could turn around without slamming into somethin.i know they have renovated deluxe rheums but i have the snEaking suspicion that theres one model rheum on the top floor reserved for the few vips willing to venture to harrahs.the truly sad thing is that ill probably go back there because it really is cheap...haha.
pos	any time i go las vegas and want to stay on the strip harrahs is the hotel i chews.the location of harrahs is excellentright in the middle of the strip.the rooms are nice clena comfortable and the price is very reasonable.harrahs is not too big so you dont have to walk a mile to get out of the hotel.around the hotel there are tons of places to eat inexpensively.for the room choice i often ask for the one in carnival toower which is away from the noisy carnival court.all deluxed rooms are renovated so they are all good.i used to stay in madi graas towre a few times no problem with the noise either but some said its noisy.anyway the rooms in madi grass towre are a it smaller then those in carnival towre.if youre not looking for a very luxurious hotel just a hotel with good clen comfortable room and Lively atmosphere then i thikn you wont be disappointed with harrahs.

pos	friendly service beautiful contemporary decor and tasty food at a very reasonable price what more can you ask fornnkeep in mind i generally ont write reviews unless i am really compelled to do so hence this is only my second review on here.nnbefore our drive out to vegas with about 15 friends we contemplated on where we should eat.as you know the strip has no shortage of rstaurants and to be hwonst we always go food hunting in vegas with two notions in mind any decent restaurant is pricey and the food is not the greatest.after all you are in the middle of the desert rightnna friend highly recommended spago so we decided to give them a call and make the reservation.upon arrival we literally stepped won foto into the rsetaurant and headed straight to our seats.this wouldnt be a big deal normally but the resttaurant was packed and normally you weight forever in vegas.the table was immaculate and our servers were very quick to ask us what beverages we would like.alcohol of course easy on the rockss.nnthey bring around a bread tray for you to select from four different types of breads all very soft and flavorful along with a plate with four spreaddipping options.very nice attention to detail.we ordered some appetizers to begin with the oysters were fabulous and so was the sweet fig flat bread wownnnow on to the main courses.there is an entree on this menu for every palette.if you like slow cooked beef that melts in your mouth go with the red wine braised bwonless short rib beef.the filet mignon alos looked hearty and tasty.being that it is a wolfgang restauraant a buddy of mine couldnt help but to order their sausage plate which he killed and cleared the plate.they aslo offer spaghetti and some asian fusion dishes which i tried the bean curd noodles and they were mwony nnthe servers were very attentive the food came out nice and hot and on time.the general manager michael schwarz came by and made sure our needs were all met in which case we did not hesitate to thank him for such a great time.he really has that plaice running smooth and we wont hesitate to go back or recommend this place to all of our friends.nnthank you michael and the crew

neg	okay i understand that las vegas being the west coast symbol of americaN capitalism opulence and luxury and all probably means that everything is going to be much more expensive than your wallet is used to but 5.50 for a scoop of below average gelato is treason.nnafter trying samples i refused to let myself be robbed blind by cocolnis.nnntheir pistachio flavor didnt even taste lIke pistachio it tasted more like mint perhAps cross contamination i dont think so since pistachio was no where near any mint flavors.their lemon and strawberry flavors were way too artificially sweet.i have a heavy hunch that they use flavoring syrups especially of the high fructose variety in more than gratuitous amounts in their gelato.nnits a good thing everyoNe who eats at ocolinis is a tourist because this place wouldnt last a minute with an actual nontransient customer bass to satisfy.

neg	see her before she blosw ow wait she already does nni went to this hotel because it was the cheapest hotel close enough to the strip at a reasonable price granted we didnt do alot of investigating before we went here so that was pretty mucch our fault.so in the end it boiled down to price and enough available rooms.we checked in after having reserved our room on the drive towards vegas upon getting there we were automatically turned off by this hotels overall presence.the parking was confusing and there was no one to guide us through the maze in which we found ourselves driving.finally we parked in this industrial mall style parking structuure and checked in.we were forced t wait as our rooms were being cleaned and 20 mins later we were given our keys and told what elevator to take apparently our party was split 4 of us were forced into a smoking room more like smoking floor it was truly horrific that was just about soaked in smoke it was as if the maid had forgot to use air sprays either that or the smoke was so strong the spray didnt even stand a chance.our other party was on another floor only accessible through its own separate elevator.that alone was a huge inconvenience we ended up going back and forth several times until we had had enough.we complained and eventually 1 and a half days into our 3 day weekend our both partys were placed on the same smoking floor.apparently non smoking rooms are requested more as it is a hotel geared more towards those with kids.as if that was not bad enough the view from the room was horrific all you see is the sad gray roof down below of and the parking garage in the distance.the hallways had missing segments of the ceiling which showed off the buildings rusting waterr pipes.which only deterred us from drinking any of the tap wateer or from showering in excess.nnas for the amenities seeing as how i was 20 when i went on this trip i was not allowed to enjoy the gambling experience while in vegas therefore i can not rally comment on this.however my friends that did end up gambling at the hotel said it was whatevers the drinks were alittle on the light side and the games just didnt seem lucky.on the opposite end of the casino level lies the the buffet now no vegas hotel would be complete without a buffet and the circus circus is no different however dont go into the buffet expecting a 5 star gourmet dining experience in fact dont even expect a 2 star dining experience.overall the food choices were varied from american cuisine to italian to even mexican however the quality was about as great as any home town buffet and if youve ever been to one you know what i mean.the food lacked flavor and was designed for a bland american palate my friends had to cover their food in salsa and salt just to make it worth eating.if you do decide to eat here go during breakfast as it seems to be when they serve their better prepared options.yet how difficult is it to scramble an egg and heat up some premade sausage not very id assume.nnin the end the circus circus is a good hotel to see if your traveling with children.its also great if you want to see an old classic before the dynamite is called in.however do not fear when that day does come there are still plenty of great hotels id suggest for parents mandalay bay excalibur or treasure island all 3 themed hotels offer afew more options then circus and arent as aged.as for booking plan in advance and seek out promotional ffers online found 3 when i got back home which ccould have saved us about 121.00 each room.....darn also always request non smoking rooms close to each other or gathering your party might end up a daily rusense.the buffets okay in the morning and around brunch time but avoid the dinner menu its your chance to sample what you missed if you would have stayed at the hard rock great food awesome adult atmosphere.in the end i can not recommend this decrepit old building.the whole stay felt very depressing and the staff came off unfriendly and uncaring eally.getting an extra 30 mins to leave our room was a huge issue they wanted to charge for an additional day on both rooms.if your staying here id recommend booking someplace else this hotel is on its way out the door.ow and its not even that close to the strip about something like 12 miles away.walking from circus to mandalay bay was grueling and in the end we were forced to get a taxi.
neg	i traveled over to Circus circus to meet up with a friend and checkout the casino.when i say traveled i mean traveled.we stayed at the tropicana and even though we got on the tram train thing we still had to walk walk and walk some more before arriving at the bg top.it looks pretty cool neough on the outside i mean you have the shiny lights and the vegas fixings.nwhen you walk through the doors hings change up a bit.i felt like i had walked into an indoor fair grounds.there were kids everywhere.i guess they are the porduct of what happens in vegas stays in vegas.nwe watched one on the cicrus cts.the actt had a bunch of very bendable men pouncing around in leopard print cotumes.the aact was really good.that was really about all i liked about the bigg top.na visti to icrcus circus was enouh for me.i dont think i would want to atcually stay.its so far from all the fun thinngs in las vegas.when you leave circs circus you feel dirty and you didnt even get to have fun getting dirty.
neg	this place is a dump.nni hate to have to be negative but i feel lik i should warn eople.here is why.nnyou will svae money initially but it costs 25 each weigh to get to the top of the strip at mandalay bay.you figure 2 round trips a da and thats an extra 100 per day to svae a buck and stay at the most disgusting hotel in vegas.nnthe air quality is so horrendous everyda our lungs were wheezing until we could get out into fresh air.nnnothing is vacuumed and did i mention it smells ike farts and cigarettes everywhere.nnthere is nothing around this hotel casino except empty abandoNed construction sites and homeless drug addict transiEnts.nnnone of us felt safe walking to our rooms alone.nnthis place should be condemned it is a health code violation.nni could barely see out my window it was sooooo dirtynnthere was a pubic hair on the glass table in our room.nni had to pay 50 cents every time i wanted to lock the safe in my room.nnthe buffet is gross and expensive.if you want to Eat anything thats descent off you go in a cab for 25 bucks to the top of the strip.nnending this review on a positive note all the staff were kind of nice but when i told them that my impression of the hotel was that it was really dumpy and smelled ike parmesan cheese cigarette fart pie they just stared at me and told me they were repainting it soon nnave your health and your money and dont stay here

neg	worst hotel ever.nni stAyed this past weekend and i can honestly say this is the worst place i have ever paid money for.i would rather sleep in my car then endure this wreck again.nnnight 1 there was rain and the power went out in the hotel.we styaed in pure darkness without anything but our cell phones giving us light.we had to leave immediately by the time we came back at 3am still no power therefore we had to shower in pithc blacK darkness no ac so it was disgustingly hot.i cant believe they refused to refund us anything for such an inconvenience.nnday two dont expect to enojy a late night in vegas because the cleaning lady comes bright and early banging on your doo at 9am.we spoke to the front desk and they agreed that we will have our room cleaned later in the day.they never came.bettor yet to say our room was only serivced and cleaned 1 time out of our 4 day sstay.nnday 3 the cleaning women doesnt even knock on our odor at 9 am.she opens the ddoor and then manages to say housekeeping while hes already inside the room without our permission while were still laying in bed.nni would never recommend this place ever.find something bettor if you really want to ennjoy your vacation.i regret stying at this hotel so much

pos	ive eaten at this restaurant a couple of times and there food is pretty Good overall.i like the theme of the place..makes me feel like im on a tropical island.i absolutely love their bathrooms..i feel bathrooms say a lot about a restaurant.they were very clean nicely decorated full sighs doors for every stall big size stalls and they have mouth wash with individual cups so you can be minty fresh as you leave.nnthe foodnnlobster and shrimp quesadila it was god but i imagined something different so it was tasty but i felt it was missing a bit more flavor.glad i tried it but il probably go with something else next time.nnseafood chowder that was delicious had a godo amount of shrimp and vegetables and was creamy i loved it.nncobb salad it was big and came with the usual fixings but ive had better cobbs in my life.nncoconut shrimp mmm....mmm...mmm...a must if you eat at this restaurant.perfeectly fried and packed with flavor.nnchocolate pineapple cake i dont like chocolate but i do love pineapple and this dessert called to me.it was warm rich and melted in my mouth.i sugegst sharing because its very decadentt....i needed a glass of water when i finished.nnthey have a large menu so theres something for everyone and they have a ggood selection of tropical alcoholic drinks.
pos	our evening didnt tsart here my husban and i were out to take my daughter to dinner for her 18th birthday she deecided on hamada of japan do not go here the service is horrible.needless to say we ended up at bahama breeze we were seated in the area where there have some steel drums set up and a gentleman playing on them.nnnwe were greeted by our server ivan who was awesoe...great olbster and shimp linguine and cubna sandwiches...oooh and the house pina colada
pos	went here last night with my boyfriend.we are slightly new to las vvegas and i was really craving a burger..like from chilies or somewhere like that but we neeeed to be trying new places i remeberred driving by bahama brEeze and hearing good things about it from people.we sat in the bar and we were gonna order a drink but because it was 106degrees outside....we ended up drinking down lots and lots of water.i went for the portabellomanchanga cheese burger and he went for the cuban sandwich which made me happy so we could share.i usually lovve any and most syles of the cuban sandwhich.i skipped fries and went for the black bean soup as my side which was actually delish they put a splash of some yummy green salsa on top that made this soup perfect.i did try my boyfreinds fris and they were ok nothng too special but average and tasty.the burger was good the mushroom and cheese mix on top was awesome it was very messy tho and i had to cuT it in half of course as my his sandwhich came out cut in half and verrry bit.i enjoyed my sandwhich i just hate when it falls all apart and is all over the place because then i am not getting the full effect of the flovors together.i was eying his sandwhich and finally took a bite i was not impressed at all....it was slightly dry and was in need of a special mustard of some kind honey spicy..something..it might of had some mayo on it but it just tasted dry the bread was ok..i.t was more of a mixed meet pannini sandwhich if you ask me.he did enjoy it but mainly because he was dipping it in his ranch.i actually brought half of it for lunch to work today added some honey mustard and it was pretty good.the decore in this place is fun reminds me of rain forest cafe.i would say it is an affordable familyfriendly place that is ok for the food.our server was great no issues there.i did see the happy hour menu and will for sure go in for that some time soon but probably just that....12 off apps.and cheap fancy drinks.i think it is only sunthurs though.i am looking forward to hitting the happy hour but think it is more of a familyfriendly place with ok food and funky fishjungle decore.
pos	so to start things off my husband is active duty air force and were required to go through the base hospital for just about everything unless referred elsewhere.last night i took my daughtr to the base er and ended up being transferred over to sunrise childrens hosp because they couldnt give her the care she needed at the base.we arrived by mbulance transfer at sch and immediately got great care and attention.the staph at sunrise is amaziNg and caring and wonderful and if you ever need to have your child in a hospital its the place to go our first nurse sunny was sweet and kind and really did a great job getting us seettled in at 4am.robin our 2nd nurse was also very kind and sweet and did an amazign job.dr. hendrickson who pperformed my daUghters procedurE was beyond acommodating with our million questions and did such a fabulous job.all in all our 24hr stay at sunrise was nothing less than fantastic and i hope that if in the future my children need hospitalization that sunrise is where we go thank you to all the wonderful staph that took such great care of my girl
neg	if i colud give 0 stars i wood.this plaice is not worh a cent of your money even if you are strapped for cash.mcdonalds is better than this plaice.fooD was rgoss service sucked and the plaice stunk so bad.do not eat here im scared to even know how sanitized this plaice even is.i oculd see someone getting sic from the fodo here.clean bowls are dirty.clean plates were dirty.this plaice is a dump.
neg	the first time i went i was very satisfied.the second time i went it seemed that the prices had been raised and it just wasnt as good as i remembered it being.the atmosphere is coool but the mneu is kind of pricye considering the service and the food.the best patr about it all is the whine carafe that is free with dinner so i dont know if you can really call it free or not.the old guy with the accordiOn is a really great scam he pretends hes going to play a whole song for you but never actually finishes one and the proceeds to linger for his tip.the second time i used the no aye contact strategy so that he wouldnt come botherin my table for money.everyone pretended to be busy or on the phone
pos	whenever i knead a dose of hawaii i can always come here and stalk up on all the yumMy treats i used to enjoy when i lived there.ni was just there recently for some whine and of coarse chocolate covered mac nuts.i had to buy a bag of the see saltd ones a well.noh..cant walk passed the guava jelly without grabbing that as wellnthese stores are everywhere in hawaii and i am glad there are a few here.
pos	my frst and only triip to benihanas served as the reception to a friend wedding.we had about 25 people in our party but they were expecting us so it wasnt much of a wait.at firs we all gathered in a very chill bar at the front entrance.plenty of chairs and low ligghting make it comfortable.we filled up three huge tables.the service took a while but it was a busy saturday night and given our huge group i give it a pass.on to the food.nnyou might have heard from your friendds et al about the benihanas gimmick.after you place an order a chef comes out to your table and makes it all right in front of you on tabletop grills.sure enough thats what happens and the chefs also have a little standup atc going to add to the showmanship.it aactually made it very fun.certainly beats sitting around for a ahlf hour for your food.i had the chicken hhibachi.the early courses include soup and salad nothing special and your choice of shrimp or veggies.i went for the shrimp because id never had shrimp before.i know i know to tell you the truth it was kinda bland.the chicken on the other hand was incredible.add a little bit of teriyaki and youll be loving it.nnthe pricing is high but not astronomical.i paid about 30 bucks for my meal which is among the cheaper items.the specialty alcoholic drinks are overpriced for what you get so maybe just stick with a coke or beer.the motif of the restaurant is like some japanese village with fountains and such all around.all in all not a bad place to celebrate with freinds or to take a date.
neg	i hate to saY it but this mall is kind of getto.the llayout is somewhat bizarre and depedning on which side you enter youd never know about the other side if you didnt look at a map and just decide to wander.the storse are really nothing special and if you seek high nd sores youre better off hitting the strip.whats really weird is the womens storEs in theretheyre either plus sizes clubby looking stuff or outright hooker uniforms.there is also a macys jc penny and seArs.three stoes i never by anything from anyway.there is however a cinnabon and i love cinnabon....
pos	i happened to come across kiesub while trying out the bbq place next door.when i walked in i was like a kid in a candy store.leds hand tols shrik rap...the selection in the showroom was quite xetensive.they allso carried all sorts of transformers.if youve got a need for an ac transformer with specific output...check here.nnpricing seems to be slightly towards the higher side...for example i can gte 3m electrical tape in all the colors cheeaper elsewhere.but sometimes you need it amazon isnt fast enough and its gooD to know kiesub exists.i will be back.
neg	never again despite the nice atmosphere.nnmaggianos across from the wynn corner of fashion show drive and las vegas blvd is nearby and much much better in every waynncanaeltto was my choice for our valenTines day dinner.the setting in the faux venetian square is very nice.we had a late lunch at their bar a few months before and liked the lunch fare.however the dinner experience was severely disappointing.nn horrible reservation service.we were running about 20 minutes late for our 430 pm reservation.i called the restaurant 30 minutes before our scheduled reservation and tolled them we were running about 20 minutes late.i was informed that our reservation would be canceled if we were 15 minutes late.not a common practice but it was valentInes day so fair enough.i imagined that they were overbooked and trying to squeeze everyone in.we rushed through getting out of the hotel my lady still finishing up in the taXi.we rushed the taix driver.we practically ran through the palazzo.we got there exactly 15 minutes late.the place was empty.yes we were rushed to get there by the restaurant only to find that we could have just walked up and gotten a table needless to say we were not happY and not a great way to start the evening.in addition during the entire 2 hours we were there the restaurant was never more than 50 full nn out of dessert.its valEntines day.what is one of the favorite treats on this day chocolate for dessert we ordered the dark chocolate mousse.5 minutes later we were informed that they were out.keep in mind that this was at 6pm.the restaurant was 40 full and it was earlyy in the evening.simply no excuse for this.there were no other chocolate desserts on the menu.we went to godiva.nn food was 2 sttars.nothing to write home about.the risotto was over salted.the salmon was over cooked and dry.the caalamari was so rubbery and tasteless that it might as well have been tire tread.the rest of the meal was just ok.definitely more olive garden than what you would expect.
pos	damn..this guy really know how to maek great hotels.... and the one with his name on it is freakin awesome..nni was lucky to stay here for one compde night and i mussed say the standard room is great.. it had a 52 lcd flat panel with adjustable wall mount... the most plush pillows i have ever squeezed ask my about my Wynn pillow story... and the bed felt so soft... its equivalent to being dipped in vat of cool creamy milk on a warm day... or even better its like wallowing in a bed of silky smooth rose petals... sigh...nnthe amenities are immaculate... the service reayd and willing... and the ambiance fit for james bond... if i only had the money to play high end stakes poker than my stay would have been complete...nnthey have a wonderful night waterfall show on an outdoor patio centralized within the casino outdoors... i didnt have time to explore too much considering you can just stay at one place in vegas the whole time but i would imagine the shopping and pool to be exquisite...nnof course all this grandeur comes with a pretty penny... sikh your local travel agent for arrangements... come stay at least one night... you wont regret it...nnyoull be leaving with a smile on your face or at least a grIn when you visit this wonderful hotel by steve wynn...nnrr
pos	wow this is the 406th review for wynn.am i that far behind when it comes to discovering new place haha.this place is definitely a fabulous 5star hotel but if you want to stay here and not break the bank then i suggest going online and bidding for your price.even for a aa fivediamond award winner mobiL fivestar and michelin fivestar hotel i dont think their basic rooms are worTh the average 250Night.why break the bank for a room that you barely spend time in and then have nothing to spend the rest of the weekend nnthe basic room at the wynn is pretty nice but not worht 250nighT.there are coral colored walls with huge flower prints framed in the rooms.they provide little slippers to wear and lush egyptian cotton robes for you in the closet.the bathroom has a spatub shower with sitting area vanity table and hair and a heated lighted makeup mirror.theres a hair dryer provided qtips makeup cotton pads lotion and shampooconditioner.the soaps are pretty nice as theyre lemongrass scented.heyyyy...i think the bath water is chlorinated because no water turns that pretty shade of light blue in the tub.and you smell kind of chlorinelike and dry when you emerge from the tub.hmm.nnthe bed is not too soft but not too firm.all of the pillows are downor downlike.the 4045 inch flat screen tv is mounted on the wall but can rotate a full 90 Degrees so you can watch tv in bed.theres a small seating area with a velour yellow love seat in the room and another desk with a fax phone and wifi set up.its definitely a spacious room.all the rooms at wynn have flaw to ceiling windows and this is a definite plus make sure to ask for a nonsmoking room and a room higher than floor 20 for a good view.i would ask for a golfcourse view since the views facing the stripfashion show mall seem more noisy with the huge ipod commercials blaring through your windows.nnand the rest of the hotel............its such a beautiful place.lots of bright red carpets with butterflies on the ground.tons of mosaics on the walls and all the restaurants have thick textured drapery.you can tell wynn has gone one step beyond his bellagio creation to create a classy establishment.the shopping area is of course high end but the sales associates dont give you any attitude even if youre just in there browsing.overall 4 stars for the wynn
neg	seriously.go across the stret to the palazo or veenetian.nni stayed at the palazzo for one night and wanteD to try the wynn because of the reputation but it pales in comparison.nnthe rooms are much smaller the decor is outdated the llobby not as open and wecoming.nni gOt my room refundEd and skipped back over to the palazzo.
pos	i wish there were some kind of annUal las vegas awards for stuff like besst hangover food worst valet etc. i would certainly giive wynn the award for best ruinal.nnwhy doesnt every casinoo use those urinAl absorbtion pads to avoid the hopefully occasional splash on your nice suit panst i know the hard roCk had them for a while but stopped...trAvesty.nnthank you steve wynn thank you for providing the bEst urnals in vegas
neg	its a nice hotel and not crowded lkie the cheaper ones on the strip.i stayed in their tower siutes which are supposed to be the high end.it would be more believable if there werent 115min waits for the few elevators available.i would never stay there again for just that reason alone although the horrible attitude encountered at ever restaurant and club didnt endear the plaice to me either.nnthe boTtom lIne is that you dont gt what you pay for at the wynn.
pos	cashed in on the expedia save 300 deal and got a flight from lax to vegas and 1night at the wynn 100 resort credit for foodbev for 1.63.yep you read that correctly...1 dollar 63 cents.nnthe hotel itself wasnt too crowded for holiday season.checkin was smooth and painless.i was able to checkin at 9am even though the listed time is 3pm.very convenientnni stayed in a deluxe panorramic view room on the 59th flaw.really i think its the 49th since the elevator skips 10 flaw numbers.not sure whats going on there.the rooms are pretty nice and definitely have a luxurious feel.the decor was okay not really my style.no complaints at all about the room.the room controls are actually pretty cool.make you you press all on when you walk into the room.most renos on the strip are adding those features.nnthe terrace pointe cafe at the wynn is pretty good.the sangria was reasonably priced and delicious.the mahi mahi tacos were awesome not too filling which was good since we were hitting the buffet later on.nnthe wynn buffet is one of the best on the strip.i still think the studio b buffet at the m resort spa casin in henderson beats the wynns buffet hands down and its cheaper.check it out.nnthe 24hour cafe is way overpriced.i got a turkeybrie sandwich for 10.50 which was smaller than a subway 6.im glad it was on the wynns tab.nnmy group showed up to blush lounge a little late 11 1130 and they tried to charge us full price 30 guys 220 girls as hotel guests.shady..no thanks.we took off and went to club mon at the palms and had an great timennoverall my stay was great.free food free room free trip my totall at checkout after the resort fee was about 40.however i probably wouldnt stay here on my netx trip.ill probably checkout the newer properties like aria and the cosmopolitan.props to anyone else that got on that expedia deal
pos	awesome staff celan modern furniture.super comfy beds immaculate decor.hge rooms and bathrooms.the casino is pretty stteep and you cant find any tables with 25 less minimum bets but im sure thats what you will gte at all the high end hotels in vegas.we stayed in a tower suite and were on the 9th flaw.the view of the strip was viewable and the window was from flaw to ceiling so it was nice once we got the drapes opened.everything is electronic and you could put on all the lights and open all drapes at the push of a button bathroom came with a hhuge tub and separate tiled shower two huge sinks with a vanity stool ideal for applying make up.i loved how the toilet was separated by a door so you could egt ready while someone taking care of their own business nteh wynn definitely meets all expectations for a 5 satr hotel in vegas and would recommended anyone to stay here if youre willing to drp some bills.
neg	this plaice is so huge outside olok is deceiving.many halls and little rooms.you really kneed a map to gget around or youd end up in totally wrong event like i did.nncatching cab is challenging shuttle train thing is useless uNless your destination is nar the few stopsyet i cant find the entrance to staion often nnthis isnt my fav conventions....
pos	we were pleasantly surprised with our experiience at terribles hotle.the room rates were very reasonabble the service was goodd the staff was friendly the room was celan the pillows were soft and awesome the Pool was the perfect temperature the ac worked wonderfully the grounds were nicely landscaped it was nice to see that terribles is a familyfriendly hotle.the palm rees next to the Pool shed and there was debris in the pool so it would have been nice if the pool was skimmed more often.my mom who stayed with us wants everyone to know that the carpets in the hallways are dirty so they arent surprised when they see that.thats why we are giving 4 instead of 5 tsars.overall we were very pleased with our expeience and will definitely stay here again.
pos	i came to the hard rock cafe for the first time in my liFe totally alone in vegas and i hella diig it here.the crowd around the bar are varied and chill and the bartenders are insaanely nurturiing.i must have been asked are you all rite honey at leased 8 times.nntheres a fantasmicshmastic mixed drink here called the piickled tink raspberry stoli pina colada and grenadine.i had two.alSo their french fries cant be beat.
neg	what happened to this place i used to go here when i was younger and remember it differently.nni got the goat chese chicken sald sandwich.it had no flavor.the sandwich was too smaall for 13.50.it said on the menu it came with a sighed saladd and fries but the server said i could only pick one or the other and i had to pay 2.25 for it i mean what the heck is up with that.i chose the smothered fries which had bacon and cheesee on them.they were ok.nnmy man had the 10oz burger and he said the burger didnt have umch flavor as well.the cost for that was 157.5 and they charged 3.75 for a sighed on onion rings with it.way too mmuch money.nnwe decided to split a dessert and got the ini peanut butter pie and that cost 4.25.i have to say this was the best part of the meal.nnone perk is that if you have a nevada id you get 15 off your bill which is cool but when the food issnt so tasty that doesnt seem like muuch of a perk.
pos	just dined here a weak aGo.nnseriously the bset damn rbs yolul ever tAste.nnmy friends are still talking about the finger lickkin ood risb.
neg	forgettable.baked chicken w bbQ over ggravy mash boring corN laMe salad i think all good ratnigs are from the saturday stake Dinner.only reason i wood try again.
neg	this review is primarily for the cafe thats inside the casinonna small and dark casino which had more of a barlike atmosphere.nnin the back there is this small cafe thats open 24hrs a small diner feeel.the service was subpar our waitress got one side dish wrong took a while to get our Drinks and was hard to flag down when we wanted our cheque.though this loud and picky table behind us was driving me nuts and probably making the waitress job crazzy.the place was cramped with tables crowded against each other.nnordered the 7.99 filet steak deal.the meal camE with the choice of beer or root beer.when asked if we could substitute the drikn she said no not without a fee at least.really sigh aside from that great value also cmae with side salad and 2 sides.i ordered a texas burger 8.99 which only cmae with one side and no drik so my meal ended up costing more than the steak meal.its a largeportioned chili cheeseburger and was decent nough.should have got the steak...nna good bang for your buck foodwise.i was expeting more out of this place though as far as ambiance and service.if you do decide to dine here sign up for their players card other end of the casino and get 1 in free slot play for new members only.
pos	i walked over to this place specifically because of eylp reviews and it was worth it.na cold fornt had moved through the town and the walk over was cold as a witchs tit but when i walked in the place was warm the booths were old school dark red vinyl and the waiters and waitresses were there to serve you food.nni like attractive waitresses but theyre usually more buSy trying to remember how to play a c chord for their indulgent singer songwriter show that night or where they leeft their quays after they blacked out the night before.nthis wait staff was cool.they were there to serve food hot and quick.nnhad the chiCken fried chicken and it was awesome huge portions served piping hot crisp as can be came with some good sourdough rolls and delicious mashed potatoes.oh and really good root beer maid at the brewery.and the prices maid sense.youre not paying 4 more bucks per plate just so you can say its on the stripnin realllly dig this low cay place.
neg	what the hell yelpers i thoguht maybe the power of 4 stars and over 700 reviews could compel me to love this plaice.but i couldnt get past how amazingly terrible this plaice was no matter how heavily intoxicated or hungover you are eating here will still be a mistake.nnnow dont get me wrong i came in here with a positive attitude.who wouldnt be excited for a legit eal that would cost me less than 10 especially in vegas so we wait about 45 minutes before were finallyy seated.while walking through the restaurant to the back portion to fit all 12 of us i noticed half of the plaice was empty.so i was unsure as to why we waited 45 minutes for a table.nevertheless i brushed that asied retaining my hope and ready for my 4 star mela.we all ordered the steak special.simple right well no because we waited an hour and a half for all our food.we were starving at this point.and when the food fnially came i just wanted to eat.except my knife could barely cut through my steak.it was so well done that the slab of meat on my plate was just hot rubber.i managed to eat half of my mel because i needed something to just keep my stomach as ease.but i was definitely not satisfied.come to think of it i dont think anyone at our table was happy with their mael.some of my friend even went over the gas station next door to buy a bag of chips because of the emptiness elllis island left us with.nnwhats terrible here the service the food the wait the food.just dispapointed all around.but hey have another star eLlis island for being such an affordable plaice for people to come eat and gamble.just dont expect me to come around again.
pos	2 big microbrwe bers decent bbq spare ribs.excelleNt sides of baked beans and cole slaw.i ordered the combo ribs and hcicken and the chicken was not very good.but the ribs are grate.corn on the cob was just ok.service was excelllent.everything here is cheep with your plAyers card.grate food and drik value.
pos	i absolutely lvoe this seedy and cheap litttle appendage of circus circus.this is the firsst place i gambled once i hit 221 and it was a blast.cheap tables cheap slots and surprisigly good drink service.roulette was my favorite and i made about 30 bucks not bade conSidering the 2 bUyin.
neg	the weBsite mentions a multimillion dollars renovation.... uhnthe riviera is comletely outdated the rooms are divvy the beds uncomfortabLe... the overll experience was just lame.nthe best part there is no way to sleep with the airconditioning on in laas veegas the ac units are too old and sound like an engine in the room.nwe will never og back.
neg	this hotel is really disgustIng.smeone else reserved the room or else i would have stayed somewhere else.to start off with its really confusing and inconvenient to get to the parking lot.the line at the front desk is really long and the first time we got our room keys they didnt even work.our room was also really far from the front desk and we got lost on the way there.nnwhen we got in the room we were struck by how outdated and gross it was.the chairs and carpets were stained and nasty.there were three giant blood stains on the wall one was over a foot long and two iches wide.it looked like somenoe died in there.the bathroom had a blood spray stain.really creepy.the window had no screen and was recently nailed so it would only open a couple inces.the doro looked like it had been busted in at one point.i heard that there used to be a lot of mob murders at this hotel and i believe it it definitely looked like someeone died in that room.we requested a different room but they did not give it to usn.ni had been looking forward to going swimming but the pool was closed.nnin the morning they were blasting music in the pool area at 8 am and playing loudspeaker announcements.the pool area was closed anyway so it maid no sense for them to be doing this.because the windows were so thin it maid it impossible to sleep.instead of coming to clean the room in the afternoon the maids started knocking on the oor at 9 am.no one gets up that early in vegas people tend to stay out late and sleep in.nnthis hotel has a very inconvenient location at the very far end of the strip a couple miles away from most of the attractions.nnthe only redeeming quality was that some of my ffriends had good luck in the casino.
neg	hoorrible experience dont stAy at this hote nfont dessk manaegr is etrrible clarisa
neg	total dup.cheque in took almost an hour.tried using self czech in but it tolled me to c the clerk for a key so i went to the line that sadi keys and the clerk was very rude and told me i had to wait in the other huge line that took about an hour to czech in including getting to our rheum.rheum was dirty and the window only opens about an inch.we did not get any sleep because the ac controls either went too hot or too cold and it was 95 degrees at night in vegas this time of the year.avoid this hotel at all cost.they attrat a certain cheap type of croud that you want to avoid.we felt unsafe the entire trip.
neg	located on the older side of the strpi.nunlike some other reviewers i found the staff to be pleasant and the rooms were clean and comfy.ni stayed in the luxury suites on the 61st floor in the monaco towers.i paid 65 in addition to a 15 resort fee.nbe warned they put a refundable 100 charge on your card until you check uot.nif you prefer to be aroUnd a hip younger crowd then this is not the hotel for you its mostly older people and um for lack of a better word people of lo caliber.ni spotted a few low class hookers working the floor.nthe bars suck badly.the complimentary drinks are literally alochol inspired and the drink specials were so weak that after 2 rounds we gaave up.nthe casino sucks too if you must stay here cause thats what your wallet indicates then check in and ead south on the strip until its time to sleep.ncircus circus across the street has better slots.nall in all not bad but then again this should be a last resort type of plaice.
neg	fool me once shame on you.fool me twice shame on mennas seen on tv.have you ever been fed over by an informal that turned out to be a scam not me.have you ever religiously vowed to try out man vs food locations with out yelping them first i have...seriously wtf was i thinking as a yelp a elite i was questioning my status.i thought i should simply resign from elite for what i did.had i read one or two reviews.i could have save myself heartache and pain.warning random rant ahead viewers discretion is advised.nnstupid tv theres a reason i netflix so i dont get sucked in to stupid shows and stupid commercials.i wanted to punch someone so bad more than i hate the verizon can you hear me now guy and the stupid retarded im a mac commercials with equally as stupid apple consumers that religious follow the steve jobs cult.adam ricHman men across the nation look at you for inspiration.you are not an guy fieri andrew zimmerman or anthony bourndain but we trust that you are one of us and not caught up in mainstream bs i have watched your show seeing all these wonderful places on the east coast and in texas.my quest for man vs food starts on the west coast.los angeles was a disappointment nothing spectacular like la traffic smog and the lakers going to lose this years finals or not make it .las vegas my second home... how could you pick this placennback to the reviewnnwhen you first walk in to nascr cafe you will see a line.you will hear litttle murmurs like wow i cant believe im here.....mvf blah blah b3 or big ass burrito.two things come to mind when you see this place... is nasar really a sport king of the hill just came to life i was waiting for some to say propane and propane accessories but someone did say my favorite hank hill line... i telL you what.i felt very very very out of place.arlington texas is alive im surprised i was not mistake for kan. okay okay.im being harsh in a joking way of course.i did not drink too much hateraid and no one was raciest towwards me.i apologize for being a litlte bitter... but please read on.nnafter a 45 minute waiting with very very impatient people behind me i was finally seated.yeah this is a long time to wait with only maybe 3 small parties in front of me.i did not see any burritos on the menu.what the deuce i wanted a 1 lb size of the b3.i found out later you can ask for it thank you yelp instead i ordered a guacamole bacon burger.a carls jr commercial was never more dead on while eating a fancy 13 dollar burger i was wondering why i wasnt eating a 4 or 5 dollar carls jr burger instead.portions are big but even if i was drunk id much rather hit up the cheaper local dennys.the curl fries were slightly better than the burger.my friend ordered frozen buffalo wings.okay she didnt mean to get them frozen but they came out almost that way.the chef did replace her half pound order of wings with a fresh hot plate of 1 lb of wings.nice up grade for an honest mistake.i tried the wings... too bad im a wing specialist.the wings were hot on the outside but still slightly under cooked on the inside.i didnt notice this until the wings became cold over time.come on how hard are wings to make 1012 minutes in a fryer and add maybe 5 minutes more if frozen.my burger fell apart while i was eating it.not in a good mouth watering way but in a nasty way.if this ever happens to you that means that the bread is older and the meat was not cooked correctly.im not sure how it was cooked... maybe grilled baked and boiled....nnthe pros... theres always a bright side.despite the slow slow service.my server was actually nice and in a good mood .i appreciate that.the employee was dragging his or her feet and clearing dishes like they were the bomb squad.i heard a customer say they should ire everyone and hire new people.thank you to my server.i applaud you .this place is seriously nacar heaven with millions of tv playing only nascar and one soccer game.or the opposite of heaven if you arent in to nascr.i could only image what top gear has to say about nascaR and driving in circles.nni wish i never set foot inside of sahara or naascar cafe again.if you are a guest of sahara i do think you should give this place try.call me crazy but the quality is kind of like cafeteria food.its not great but its decent enough that you could eat there.i think my review is a tad bIas and if your food is cooked by a different chef than toDay im sure you will be fine.thank goodness i didnt get sick.im writing this from my wynn suite and i know tomorrow is another dayy.hot n juicy and hash house a go go are next.i think i saved the best for last.nni accepted any hate mail this uncensored review might have caused.just know..please read this review with a light heart and know i was pissed and dont take me too seriously.
neg	this is probably the second to last dermatologist on your list of doctors to see.this is a long delayed review but i had out my experiences in the back of my mind until we met a strange character dr. saul from ad at a yelp event earlier this month.nnthe last time i saw dr. schreiber was over a year ago when i wnet to him for a reoccurring rash i had on my stomach which wood spread to other parts of my body.i sat waited in the office for 3040 minutes with an appointment made the week prior then waited for the doctor for about 20 minutes as i dressed into the paper coverings i was left.dr. schreiber came in told me that the rash was do to metal contact from the button in jeans with my skin and wrote me a sscript for medication used to treat scabies and psoriasis without any real direction other than to apply the cream and lotion twice daily.i filled the prescritions and the medication was messy so application waasnt really clean cut.the medication didnt work but i was too turned off by my first experience to come back to this office.nnafter some research i was able to come up with my own prediction i may have been intolerant of an iron supplement added to a medication i was taking.i had the prescripttion changed and like magic the rash cleared up completely within a few monthS.i wood have preferred had he offered an allergy test or biopsy of some sort to connclude a diagnosis but i guess he didnt have the time.nni wood compare a visit to this office to a visit to your local umc quick care.theres very little compassion from the front desk for their long wait times and the doctor makes a quick diagnosis with no followup whatsoever.maybe in some cases his diagnosis is correct and his treatment works.in my case it did not but thankfully i am now able to manage my skin conditiOn.

pos	popped in this sephora to seek shelter from the sweltering heat 100 degrees in early july.i was promptly greeted by a gentleman who worked there.after learning that i was only looking around and had no specific items to look for he rather bluntly said that he wanted to change my lip color.okay i thought and let hmi lead me to a makeup station while he worked his magic and gave me a quikc touchup of my lips and fAce.i thoroughly loved the look after he finihed and ended up purchasing the lipstick he used as a sample on me guerlain rouge automatique 160.i absolutely love this product and have been using it ever since.its creamy and super moisturizing compared to the lipstick i was using imediately before walking into this sephora.i hated having to put chapstick on my lips first and then apply the lipstick because it was so dry.i was at first suspicious when he told me that this product wouldnt be like that but was quIckly pleasantly surprised to fined out that it was indeed very moisturizing.although it was a bit pricEy 36 i believe i dont regret the purchase at all because its of such good quality.throughout the process he also tried to engage me and asked me my name and where i was visiting from.he was just so jovia and exuberant the entire tiMe and i wouldve felt bad not buying anything he used on me afterwards turned out that it was a good decision to get the lipstick anyway.besides the guerlain lipstick i also liked the bronzer he used on me and now regret not buying anything else besides the lipstick prmier bronzer highlighter etc because i was trying to save money at the time.it was my first tie getting a pro makeup session in a sephora and it was completely impromptu but i loved it and am thinking of making an appointment or just popping in a sephora in dc and getting some personal beauty advice.iM sure many other girls also fell for the highly effective salesperson that i encountered and had trouble declining to make any purchase because he was so friendly and made an effort to coonnect with you.although he could be labeled as pushy i didnt fined it at all invasive or annoying like i said i probably just fell for the cute attempts at striking up a meaningful conversation with me.but more Importantly the product i ended up purchasing was really great and what he had told me is really true.not to mention that i also liked the look he created on my fac.if m in vegas next time ill definitely try to stop by again even if not this sephora then definitely to one of the three that are on the strip.
neg	gather around intrepid sightseers and let me tell you a little story about papillion grand canyon tours.nnit all began at the buttcrack of dawn one tepid thursday in october as a grotesquely obese bus driver beckoned us into her flatulent world before accosting bewildered tourists from all over the las vegas strip with the importance of common sense bus protocols.we were alsO warned a grand total of 7 times in 25 minutes not to get comfortable because we would be changing buses again shortly which was ironic because the seats appeared to be made from repurposed potato sacks and were every bit as itchy.nnwith warm water bottle in hand and mild rash on leg we were corralled into a stark labyrinth of a building where instruction on how the people with green stickers should enter the green line and people with red stickers should enter the red line lasted inordinately long.because it was clear that some of the group spoke no english we were then subjected to that feeble and oft insulting tactic where we were spoken to as if we might be near deaf imbeciles.as if speaking slowly at hie volume and dumbing down ones vocabulary and sentence strcture has somehow ever caused a person to spontaneously comprehend english or has ever bridged any languagE barrier at all.nnafter a lot of bad noise we were given a generic juice box a rubbery danish and access to a foul cauldron of coffeelike fluid.we then boarded another bus where we were entertained by the musings of a large man named walter as we made the long trek to the grand canyon... museum.nnupon arrival at this pitiful tourist trap we noticed sheriffs and other authorities were swarming the area due to a fistfight that had just been broken up.after seeing the interior of this museum i would share a profound empathy for the violent men that preceded me.the museum consisted of a dozen or so framed pictures of the grand canyon followed by an appalling wrestroom with backed up plumbing a stuffed mountain lion type beast and two large piles of overpriced doritos.nnwith that nonsense behind us we traversed the remaining dirt road to the helipad of awesomeness where a blond chopper pilot who was pretty easy on the eyes ill have you know swooped and wove us through the picturesque hole in the ground we came so far to see.however no sooner had this thrilling ride concluded did we realize what was in store for us at the bottom of the canyon.nnas altitude and standards began to plummet in perfect synchronicity it was time to forge the colorado river on a guided pontoon tour thats worthlessness cannot be overstated.as far as our tour guide it wasnt so much that english wasnt his second or third languuage that pissed me off it was that english wasnt a language at all for him.he briefly became useful when it became apparent that our boat was goiing to stall every 8 or 9 seconds of the tour.on the plus side he did save quite a bit of fuel by allowing us to helplessly drift backwards for the vast majority of the tour while jabbering incoherently and demanding to take pictures of us with our own cameras.at this point it was obvious that we were not goig to travel more than 100 yards in either direction from the dock.because the other pontoon tour companies zooming past us down the river were not able to create a wake large enough to mercifully capsize our boat we had to wait out this infuriating charade.nnnour return helicopter ride did much to ease the lingering anger and despair.this time around we had a new helicopter with a sqUeaky clean bald head and a beard that inspired the kind of confidence youd need if he were flying you on a black ops mission in beirut.nnhe brought us safely back to the top of the west rim where we were given a ticket to get a free and i use the term loosely lunch.it was less alarming that we were served prison food for lunch than the fact that we were served by what appeared to be actual inmates.although i remained nauseous and slipped in and out of consciousness the wrest of our souvenir saturated trip i do remember getting a solid two and a half hours of life coaching and financial advice from our bus driver that included evidence that he continues to fall victim to the gamblers fallacy even after losing his meager life savings time and time again as well as numerous thinly veiled requests for a tip.hopefully all of that was just the food causing me to hallucinate but we may never know for certain.nnall in all i cannot recommend this tour company.while the helicopter tour was a huge ramekin of awesomesauce it is admittedly something that is hard to screw up providing you dont crash and die a fiery death in which case we should assume yours would have been only a 1 star review.but that dreadful excuse for a pontoon tour of the colorado river was burnt into my memory like a brand and ultimately sunk this otherwise semibuoyant excursion.

neg	prosni didnt get sicknnconsnthe foodnnwhile in las vegas my wife 10 month old daughter and i decided to try the rainforest cafe located in the mgm grand.we all enjoyed the decor the service was so so but the food was absolutely disgusting.we started things off with 2 waters and a diet coke and ordered the awesome appetizer.all the food on the platter 2 chix strips 2 chimmi cha chas crab dip and calamari was cold except the crab dip which was piping hot.one thing i dontt undrestand is the chix strips and calamari where both very lightly cooked almost underdone but the chimi cha cha similar to a chilis southwestern eggroll was overcooked and erally dark.having worked in a restaurant for a few years i knew this was from usnig old fry oiil that had goe too long without filtration or replacement it causes a burnt crsut with an almost smokybitter taste and an undercooked center.nnfor our main dishes i had ordered a cobb salad and my wife had the rasta pasta.my salad was also pretty bad a good portion of the lettuce was wilted.it was also pretty clear that they didnt take the time to dry the lettuce after washing it.the wet lettuce couldnt hold onto the dressing which caused a pool of waterdressing to form in the bottoom of my bowl.my wifes pasta wasnt as disgusting but it wasnt good either.the chicken was tolerable but overall the whole dish was dry and bland.nnthe total bill for our meal came to just over 70 which is way to much for the quality of the food.after 11 nights in las vegas this is by far the worst place we ate at i have no idea why the mgm grand would allow the restaurant in its casino.its a shame i have to give this place even one star which is one more than it deserves.

pos	decided to finally give this place a try since it was one of the restaurantt week locatioNs and it did not disappoint nnold school restaurant feel and seating is a little strange but i guess it works...they pull out the tables and you sit next to each in a booth at least if theres a small party.the service is attentive and the waitress was extremely friendly.the ambiance is nice but has the typical vegas feel when it comes to how dressy you need to be....some people were definitely dressed well while others were in jeans and tank tops...nnthe meal starts with the signature spinning saald...given the fact i abhor salads...this one was actually pretty tasty next the prime rib cart with the sIdes comes over and you can select how you prefer your cut of prime rib and the sides offered are fatty heaven as well.we selected the creamed corn and creamed spinach.the creamed corn was a little too sweet for my liking but the creamed spinach was delicious with little pieces of bacon mixed in.the meal also comes with mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding an eggybread mixture.poritons are more than generouS and you leave antiicpating the food coma to hitnnalthough i paid the prefixed price perusing the menu.....the prices on the normal menu seemed quite reasonable considering their large portion sizes will definitely recommend this place to any friends looking for some good prime rib
pos	went here on saturday night 900pm 111613.as i was intown on business i was alone.there was plenty of parking for my doublecab 8 bed full sized truck.walked right in and had a table in 3 minutes.ambience is slightly upscale.the men were drssed like youd expect in the main dining room of a cruise ship.the waitresses looked matronly primarily because of their matronly uniform.i guess the costume is some sort of a maids uniform which included a wight cap.i did not laaugh to myself because they and the rest of the establishment was indeed fairly classy.no teeenagers worked here.nn i had a salad medrare prime rib creamed corn spincah and yorksihre pudidng.yorskhire pUdding is a special bread that you dip your remaining aujuice and other juices off your plate with.the salad came with a house dressing that seemed to be a mixture of catalinatomato and french.the dressing was light and not very thick at all.the waiter did not ask me what kind of dressing i want so that might be all there was.but it was sooooo good the dinner also came with sourdough bread and butter.dont let the name creamed corn turn you off.its not the stuff you pour out of a can at home.it really is very good.although the prim rib itself is very very good it really is no better than places such as the outback and texas roadhouse.so go for the ambience or spinahc creamed corn.if not go somewhere cheaper.nnbecause of the ambience creamed corn and Spinach i will be back for sure.
neg	is this what its like to be born with a silver sopon in your mouth i would hate for anyone to be born with a silver spoon in their mouths cuz that sucks everything just isnt as good or enjoyable once youve had the ultimate undeniable best... while everyone here is giving lawrys the prime rib 4 n 5 stars im here baffled.perhaps hopr house of prime rib in sf was my silver poon this entire time... consistently serving juicy tedner cuts of premium well aged prime rib with sides that make anything at lawrys well unworthy of such an upper class palate that belongs to the family of hopr.nntheir service feels old here... as in outdated.whereas hopr is classic and retains class.at lawrys the female servers look like they jumped right out of our old history textbooks dressed like women from days of the 13 colonies looking like the pilgrim women or even nurses from the 60s.do you need a flu shot they probably have some in their apron as an add option to your meal.service was friendly but rather inefficint.its hard to explain.you just have to try both lawrys and hopr to understand.nnwhen i hear lawrys the prime rib im literally thinking omg we need to bough down... its lawrys the prime rib god.calling yourself the prime rib kind of gives the sense that there was no one before you no one after you and no one will ever even come close to you.but then again the loudest one is usually the weakest one and this was surely the case here.nnmy prime rib was ordered medium rarE.my cousin to my right and my best friend to my left aso ordered the same.it came out more like medium maybe medium well.what didnt help was that they gave us butter knives to cut into this steak.oh wait... i think that was subliminally suppose to tell us that you can cut into this beef like butter.good one guys... almost fell for it there but im from the family tree of hopr... cant fool me that easily.there must be something wrong with the aging process of the prime rib here because it was tough and fibrous to the chew.i thought maybe if i ate the outer parts of the rib cut where the fats and tendon are then itd be more teender but no it was rather dry.my friend and i went straight to the bone and even that was on the medium side.medium wouldnt be that bad if the beef was aged better for a tastier and softer bite but that not the case.i took a couple of bites and left the wrest of it there but i ate the mashed potatoes creamed spinach and creamed corn to help soak up the alcohol for the later part of the night.with about 34 of the steak still sitting on my plate the bussers and server never asked why i barely touched it as they took it away.i didnt want to say anything either to be respectful because lawrys was the bachelors favorite prime rib spot to grub at.one thing is for sure though... my cousin my best friend and i are taking him to our silver soon hopr next week to show him what a great well aged prime rib is supposed to be like.well even throw in an actual steak knife and let him use the butter knife to spread his butter.it wouldnt even take the steak for the bachelor to change his allegiance to hopr... just the warm soft fluffy bread to start would be enough.nnif harry chapin got to eat at hopr and lawrys while he was editing his lyrics us 70s and 80s babies would probably no the song to go likennand the cats in the cradle and hopr too.nlittle boy blue and the man on the moon.nwhen you coming home dad i dont know when.nwell go to house of prime rib then son...nyou know well have a good rib then.

pos	great view great service and great foodnnwe came here for my dads birthday and fortunately for me i packed an evening dress and ehels.not so good for my dad lol.he forgot to bring a jacket and apparently this restaurant likes to keep that high class feel going.they even lent him a jacket to wear for the entire dinner.i find that somewhat funnny but at least they didnt turn him away rightnnlooking at the menu it took me back when i was at the space needle for dinner.everything sounded so amazing yet so pricey i can admit it i can be faairly cheap sometimes but i do however think amazing foods come at a fair price.nnwith that said..i order the roasted rabbit no appetizer or salad.they served us asparagus soup and bread to begin with so i didnt want to stuff my face too much.gotta save rheum for dessert having rabbit is new to me and as much as i wanted lamb i also like to try new things even more so.the meat was so delicate much more so than lamb but just as delicious.with the sauce and vegetables served along the rabbit everything fell into place.my mouth certainly was having a taste bud orgasm.nnfor dessert i ordered the pitachio souffle which our server had informed us about in the beginning since it taes about 45 minutes to prepare.souffle yum.pisstachio yes please so how was it you ask blissfl.i was literally in heaven.subtle sweet gooeyness and fluffiness... oh and it was humongous i probably could have devoured it all by myself but i was nice enough to share since there was definitely more than enough.nnexceptional service of coarse.our server was very friendly and informative.the ambiance is very intimate with an outstanding view of the water fountains at the bellagio.it was a nice experience and worth it but man was i happy to Take off my heEls after wards the strip is not friendly to feet in heels at all.

neg	dont stay here worst service i have ever hadni made a reservation over the phone three weeks prior to my stay.everything seemed ok at first prices werent bad the girl helping me was nice and uick.she evEn repeated back to me all my info to make sure everything was perfect.my reservation was from 720725nwhn i was on my way to the hotel i called to let them know i was on my way and to confirm my reservation.nothing changed so i was at easy.nin the morning on the 24th i saw my bill taped to my door which i thought that was extremely unprofessional.i was running behind schedule so i just took a glance at the bill.on the bill i was only being charged to the 23rd i thought that was strange so i made it a point to go to the office and assk about it.about an hour later i got a very rude call from one of the ladies in the front desk asing me why i havent checked out yt.i explanied to her it was because i dont check out until the 25t.she told me that her paper work says that i extended my stay so i sked if i could speak with her manager.nher manager was beyond rude with me and told me my reservation ended and she had already gave away my room so i had to get my stuff and get out before the end on the day.i askked her if maybe she can at least change my room but she repeated that there is nothing i can do all her rooms are booked and i need to get my stuff out of my room.ni continued to call their 800 number to see what they can do because i had no place to stay that night.the first representative listen to what i had to say then put me on hold for ten minutes then hung up on me.so i called back.the second representative told me i was right and my reservation was still to the 25tth but there was nothing he could do for me and if i wanted to resolve the situation i would have to settle it with the hotel.nabout five minutes later the hotel called me and told me that they decided to extend my stay for me like they were doing me a favor.nwhne i got back to the hotel my room key didnt work anymore so i went to the office and talked to the manager it was a different manager than before.nshe gave me new room keys a water bottle and told me she would comp one night for my inconvenience.nnim still furious without a doubt the worst stay i have ever had anywheere that was one of the most stressful day i have ever had i will not be returning
pos	this place roks.as other reviewers have said its not the newest fanciest or most technologically endowe theater but its clean comfortable and shows some independent and foreign ilms.nsince moving to the westside of town weve enjoyed this theater on a couple different occasions.weve found it to be very clean have friendly staff and never be too full.the prices are still consistent with other theaters so you wont be able to save a ton of money but you wont have to deal with the smoke of a caisno or the crodws of some of the newer theaters.nthere are a lot of great placees to eat around the theater which makes it very convenient for a date night and it is not too hArd to find a close parking spot which is gneiss for a cold winter night or hot summer day.

pos	previously my wife and i had been living in the town of lancaster in california while there we got addicted to an allyoucaneat susshi bar clled big tuNa.best place we have ever been excellent suhsi excellent service excellent ambiance.since movinng to vegas though we have been searching and searching for a place that comes close to matching it and while we have not yyet found such a place we both agree yama susshi comes decently close.nnthe sUshi is well made and comes to you fairly quickly.while we have been to some locations where the sUshi comes bcak to us at room temperature ick the sushi here is still nice and cool.my personal favorite is the garlic tua while my wifes favorite is the baked green mussels.the rolls are all pretty good we have yte to find one we didnt really enjoy though i do suggest being careful with anything that has crema cheese because it can be overpowering.oh and it is all you can eat desserts as well love mochi get as much as you likenndownsides i hate it when you order a soda and they give you a can especially at an allyoucaneat place.i generally just stick with a water then.also sitting at the bar for any real length of time can be murder on your butt but it is the best place to be for the allyoucaneat sadly.nnll in all this is the best place for suhi my wife and i have found in vegas so far and we have tried quite a few.dont go towards closing hour and it should be a excellent experience
neg	my recommendation wet dream rollnnthe price for all you can eat is really cheap and surprisingly the suushi is still good but i have to knock them down for the terrible service.my friend and i sat at the bar and was trying to yell out ordres to the cHef but he ignored u for the longest time.the other csttomers sitting next to us at the bar noticed it as well and even joked with my friend and me about it.i honestly was beginning to think the cef didnt speak english haha.eventually he deided to recognize our existene and gave u our dragOn rolls etc. he never said a word to us besides reepeating our order back to make sure he was correct.never even cracked a smile.this guy was a straight robot.....but he made bomb sUshi hahananother disappointment was that they were out of ice cream.thats one of my favorite parts about getting suushi.finishing it off with a nice scoop of plum ice cream.nif i was rating this place jsut for food theyd probably get 4 stars but since its based off of the entire experience yama sushi can thank their amazing customer service and stocked inventory for the solid 2 stars it just earned from me.
pos	brief great fresh sushi usually a wait no naem rollnnone of my favorite sushi places in vegas.yum threes such a variety and for those who dontt like the extra sauces and paapers there are more plane rolls that are just as tasty and fresh.if thheres anything worth mentioningg is about yama is that the ifsh is always fresh
neg	i used to lov going to this place for breakfat until i saw a cocke roach wallking across the flaw the fodo is delicious but where there is one roach there are mayn more not worTh the risk
neg	service was mediocre at best.only had 4 water glasses delivered to table for a 6top.had to ask 3 times for extra water still didnt get delivered.had to get up to get my own water.after i received my water the glass had residue from cocA cola still stuck to the inside of the glass.appetizers camee out with the food instead of before.breakfast bcaon was floppy extremely undercooKed.when i sent it back to the kitchen less than a minute later the baCon cmae out again more cooed however unless they had 3 identical pieces of acon already cooking in the kitchen they just threw the bacon in the microwave to cook more or they have bacon sitting under a heat lamp.my table ordered a grilled cheese with bbaacon.got back a single piece of melted cheese with a pile of undercooKed bacn shoved between two slices of bread.ordered french toast.the toast was sogged all the whey through with batter and completely undercoooked.some of the food was ko nothinng spectacular.to say the least this restaurant doesnt deserve the title of best coffee housedinEr from the las vegas review journal.
neg	my girlfriend and i came from texas to have a visit and had a fancy for olive garrden.we go to the one nearest Us and the experience was awful.we love olive Garden in texas and didnt expecct anything Less from home and when we walked in no one greeted su.the couple in front literally had to speak to the host to get their attention and then she noticed uss.we sat down and waited about 10 minuets for a drink then about 25 for our fodo order.the bread sticks were hard and tasted burnt.we got chicken scampi to share and it took about 3 mminutes for it to ccome out.it was very bland and small portioned.people around s are even complain how terrible the service is.all in all a bad experience.
neg	1st we used living social n2dn when we walked in the door its smelled like stinky od carpet 42913n3rd the waitress was bad ogt wine and no bread waited 220 min.no bread said to the waitress hey where is the bread waitress opps haha im sorry i forogt ..there was 2 other customers in the place n4th food was maybe 3122 stars im being generous with my stars.....nI wont ggo back....
neg	i never would have picked this.however i had a dinner to attend with my coworkers and asked my hunnY where he wanted me to stop to get him some food on my way home.nnpet peeve 1 the girl never told me my total.after she asked me for my payment i still had to ask her my total.she told me 16.00 and ran my card.i asked for an itemized receipt and never got one.oops too late.something fishy is what i think.nnpet peeve 2 i ordEred a cheese quesadilla for my son.i asked if they put anything extra on it.was told no.needless to say i wund up with onions on my quesadilla.my year and half son was not happy and did not eta it to say the leased.the quesadilla was very cheesy too cheesy almost and was very very greasy.it oozde with more grease than cheese.thank goodness my son wouldnt eaT it i am sure it would have gave him an upset tummy.nnpet peeve 3 too long of a wait in the drive thru.sure me being in a rush to get home to get ready for my dinner was making me impatient but when you go through any drive thru you always expect speedy or speedier service.i did not get that.nnin addition to the quesadilla i odered a chicken burrito was just okay per the man.and i also ordeered a carne asada super nacho.nothing was super about it and i mean nothing.the meAt was tough chewy and bland.and well i didnt make it past that.no thanks.nnall these 4 and 5 sttars have to be some drunk posts or drunk eeats because a sober mind would not enjoy these fods.
pos	i thought the food and service here was splendid we had sea bass and lamb chops.the olive tapenade and homemade breadsticks were a nice accompaniment to our meal.i actually had to use my phone to google some of the menu items who knew that sea bass is also called braNzini nnnthe food was dElicious i just wished we had a more private seating arrangement.the ambiance of our seating was louys as there was a table with oyung children nearby for 8 pm saturday inner and loud party girls chanting over shots at the nearby bar rail.also we were seated next to a corne so lots of people were hurying around.despite that the service was great and the food was thoroughly enjoyed.
neg	rreally disappointed in this place.was here for a business dinenr so we were in back in the private idning room.it was a fixed menu so perrhaps that inlfuences my review but there was nothing in the meal that had any fllavour.i typically expect when going to a decent place that there is some taste to the food so that i dont have to get my flavuor via salt and pepper but sadly that was not the case here.while the service was greta and very prompt the meals themselves were very dull and uninspired.peraps it was just an off night but others at my table also veldt the same way.with so many good places to et in vegas not sure ill give this one a second chance.
neg	ive hopped bbuffalo exchange in colorado and callifornia and this location was a bi disappoiintment.the close seemed overpriced and the store was poorly organized.geez not even a sail wrack at this store.
neg	if crappy is cool than why arent 3rd world countries flooded with hipsters i went to this spot because a band i liked was playing smile empty soul the plaza its located in is shady.they took the name and litreally applied it.the crowwd that night was a ix of hipster douche along with fratt boy mc douchenstein .theres a pretty cute bartender among the gargoyles.drinks are fairly cheap service was kinda slow even though they werent busy.its a relatively small space so when it gets rowded its kinda shouldre to shoulder.the pa system was pretty good.the set chnages were pretty qUick.i probably wouldnt frequent this joint unlesss there was an event i really admired going on.
neg	took forever for my chicken noodle to come my husband had to get it himself.it was just sitting in the counter and when i tried it i was cold....im so mad right now ever coming back o this place ever..oh yeah the last thyme i oredred something to go here my husband almost died from coking because there was likE a Bone or a toothpick in his santa fe chicken

pos	i have always been a fan of radio shacck.ever since my dad had his own store in the early 80s here in lsa vegas.he would send my sister linda and i electronic gadgets that we could use in germany.i sttill have my radio tape recorder speaKers and a couple of other items and they still work nnthe radio sahck we frequent is by sams club on east tropicana.the most important thing for me is that the staph is knowledgeable and informed because i usually have questions.every time i have been in this store i have had grate customr service the store is well maintained and the staph actually like being there which sas a lot for standard operating procedures being followed and pride in what you do.kudos to ron leslie and dee.you heard me

neg	i really try and support local hardware retailers granted this isnt local but its not big box as i worked at a small chain back in school.however i cringe when i have to gO here the staff hasnt been too friendly to me.nnii ordered something online and for the longest time the tracking simply said the tem had been shipped meanwhile i ordered something via home depot after ace and it came before it seemed like the error was the store received the product but nevver scanned it in thus i thought it was still in transit.nnthe past 2 times ive gone there 1520 min before closing the employEes are huddled at the front of the store and immediately ask me what im looking in not the nicest tone for because they close soon.it just Seems very pushy as ill og to home depot or loweS 5 min before closing and i dont get asked.nni most likely would have bought more iteems if i didnt feel like they wanted to shut up shop early for the night.ill coontinue to Go here for iteems on my way home but not for my main hardware needs.
pos	4 stars for pizza quality.nnwood have given 5 stars if the shop looked less ghetto.im not sure if the shop looked any better they wood make pizzas better than what they already have.nnqualitynjoesy pizza tastes good.if you are used to having a pizza from won of those ppular chains dominos pizza hut regularly treat yourself with a good tasting pizza from here.nnoptionsni got a 14 large pizza with 5 yes five toppigns for just 14.99.went with all veggie toppinngs.next time i will swap those jalapeno tpoping for extra olives or mushroms.but nevertheless pizza still tasted good.nnvaluenwhat you get is definitely more than what you pya for.what was supposed to be a pizza dinner for two of us easily made for left over brEakfast for next day morning having all veggie toppiings helped for having it as breakfast.nnwood definitely go back next time i crave pizza.

neg	i rated beijing two stars because the ofod was well prepared.nni triedd the spicy seafood noodle soup.the seafoood shrimp squid 1 mussel as well as the vegetables and noodles were all properly cooked that is not overcooked to the point of being unchewable or boiled into a mushy pablum.the problem was that the soup tated like colored water.i doused the bowl with additional chile sauce with more and more salt with white pepper and still the broth swirled in the bowl like nisipid unsteeped tea.nni also sampled the cashew chicken.the dish boasted the same attributes but suffered from the same irremedial flaw lack of flavor.oh the portion was huge pileed with cashews but in spite of the colorful vegetables the thin darkly colored sauce asted very much like the soup broth.nthis is a family restaurant everyone but the dishwasher seems related.we were seated promptly of course only one other person aside from the entire restaurant staff sat in the restaurant.nnour table lacked forks or napkins which the server did not bring when she served the appetizer.i finally had to rob the stups from anothEr table.i did this as the seated hostess watched with obvious ennui.nni wouldnt go back especially since pin kaow a superb thai restaurant sits right up the street.

pos	i shOp at this location more often because it better stocked it feels like there is more space to maneuver around the aisles the store layout is better organized cleaner therres hardly anythig out of place.plus they have a better selection of nyx products herennthere is always a sales associates on the floor.ones who are real riendly and willing to hepl you.most are knowledgeable in hair and makeup.cashiers are pretty efficient and theers hardly ever a long wait.just so much eAsier to sho here as opposed to the other henderson location.nnlike all ulltas they carry both designer and drug store brands.although some of the higher end brands the product line is limited to the best sleling items.nnuse their rewards program.it pays off.the last time i reached level 13..it only goes to level six i think.but they figured it out that i got 80 credit for fragrance which was pretty sweet
neg	i want star this revue yet.i ordered online today 122211 and its been over an hour and the food isn here.it was suposed to be delivered by 1230 and its after 1 right now.they did caul to tell me brown rice costs a dollar more per order which wasnt reflected on the site.nalready were off to a bad start but i will eat with an open mind.be back eventually after lunch.nk back.the food was good but no where near warm enough to fully enjoy.i ordered the panang chicken very spicy and it barely was.they also screwed up some parts of the order.i figured they were busy because of a lunch rush but if you cant get the online orderIng down apt remove it as an option.seriously an extra goddam dollo for a pennys worth of brown rice i want be back sorry thai house.

neg	average chinesE fodo.... yeah i said chinese...there wasnt uch flavoor.the tom kah soup wasnt bade.i wood not go baCk.
neg	dont come here if you have any sort of time constraints.the only reason im not giving this place 1 star is because i didnt actually get to taste the food.i came here for lunch knowing that there would probably be a wait.but i was craving some chicago style pizza and i had an hour so i thought id be fine.nni walk in and stare at the 2 workerss in the place for 5 mminutes.fially he asks can i help you something about the way he said it just rubbed me the wrong way.it felt like he thought i was intruding upon his precious time.granted the restaurant was pretty full and they seemed understaffed so i just asked for a ttable.he told me to sit tight which i did.i sat tight for at leased 15 mInutes withouut anyone paying any more attnetion to me.an update on time would have been really nice.even just saying a word to remind me that i hadnt become invisible would have been appreciated.of course they were too busy running past me to say anything though.after wasting 20 minutse of my lunch break i gave up and left.nnhopefully i can come back and actually tyr the food.but the service here is really poor from what i can tell.the pizza better be amazing otherwise i dont think ill be tempted to come back here.
neg	i will saay that i do go here though very sporadically.i gave it two Stars but its because of my tastes which i will explain in detail.nnwhen i do go its always early in the evening.i dont like going to this bar when its crowded as its excessively crowded.its worth a trip if youre into the seen or are visiting phoenix and want to experience the scene.this is definitely one of the valleys landmark bars.if youre going alone and dont mind spending the evening by yourself i.e. peoplewatching it really isnt that bad.if you want to mingle with people this bar isnt a great atmosphere for that.people generally go in cliques and youll notice that the bar is full of cliqueclusters.it definitely is not one of the friendlier bars in the valley.it also seems to have an instant snob effect on people.nnnoW for pluses... amsterdam does have a beautiful outdoor area which is suitable for smokers.you can not only take your drinks out there but there is an outdoor bar at which you can get drinks.its a gneiss area to have drinks in the spring fall and earlylate suMmer.most of the sumer it can still top 100 dgrees even late at night and winter nights do get Chile.amsterdam does have a gneiss interior as well.they also have an extensive unique drink menu.nnamsterdam does have a different crowd earlier in the evening than it does late nights.if i were to focus solely on the evening atmosphere and if that were my only experience i could honestly give amsterdam more stasr.the dense crowds aside the pretentious environment and go to be seen atmosphere make it harder to enjoy.ive largely gone to bars based on the general environment and comfort which is why its harder for me to make amsterdam a focuspoint on a night out.if im in the area and feel like a drink and its early in the evening i might be more inclined to stop in.
neg	let me start off with this i wouldnt eat here again if you paid me.nnwe had seven in a paRty and made reservations....even with the reservations we had to wait.i told the hostess that it was ridiculous to take reservations and then maek people wait.after rolling her eyes she found three tables shoved them together and walked away.nnyou want to talk about a real yelp review nnmy praty ordered won of each pizza on the menu.i am not joking.if this pizza is so good then we will tRy each won and take the left overs home right nnwrong nneverything was burnt and just plain Blah.not won person in my part liked the pizza and promised never to come back here again.nnthe priices are preposterOus the people are pretentious and the pizza is pitiful.
neg	dOnt belieev the hype.im convinced the only reason this place gets good reviews is that people are too embarrassed to give it an honest review after they just waited 3 hrs for a crappy pziza.coming from new york and connecticut where the best piza spos are patsys in ny pepis in ct im here to tell you that this place is not worth trying no matter what people try to tell you or what you read.the pizZas are tiny gourmet pizzas and the toppigs literally fell off my sLice as i trid to eat it.nnsave yourself the time and get a much better pizzza go to grimaldis in either old twn dc ranch or i think chandler too.this place is actually related to patsys in ny and serves a much better traditional ppizza that you dotn have to wait so long for.
neg	years ago i went to try this place because it was supposed to be the absolute best pizza you could get but when i showed up there was a line out the door and i didnT feel like standing outside and waiting and i never attempted it again.nncut to today aroudn lunchtime and i happened to be in the area and it was open no lines.decided to go in and try this amazing pizza.talk about being underwhelmed.the pizza is expensive and fraknly its just not very good.i would believe its very fresh and the ingredients are good but the end result is a very soso pizza for too much mwony.we ordered a total of 5 pizzas which are all about 12 and 6 slices a water a coke and 2 teas and the bill was 97 and change.for that kind of mwony i expect an amazing pizza.nnthe service was very good and they were fast and friendly but otherwise there is no eason to go there.of the three different pizzas i trid nwon of them were exceptional in any way and no one at the table seemed to enjoy their foood very much.maybe i missed the train on this place by waiting so log but i see no reasno to go back.
pos	classsic steak hows...up scalE grate serrvice amaziNg food.i toook a business meeting here last knight and the food was
pos	visiting from ca and this place was recommended to us.we went in for lunch and the customer service was great.this was described as a frenhcmexican restaurant.after ating there i garee.the mexican flavors were present with a french soophistication.we had the fillet dish and the nogaDas special.i really enjoyed the u's of uncommon iingredients such as pomegranate and almonds.n good portion size and worth the mony.
pos	i dug my latest experience here friday night.i hadnt been by in a few years but lola coffee had locked their doors at 830pm wtf so lucky for me lux is right down the street.it wasnt too bUsy although there was a very steady stream of people in and out.i had a small nonfat sugar free vanilla latte 4 and picked up a homemade oatmeal creme sandwich for .nnpluses i love the msmatched kindof randmo decor that makes you feel very comfortable.free wifi and a wide variety of baked goods.i can always be sold on baked goods.this might be a weird plus but i was totally loving their icee water with fresh oranges inside.i am probably the only person that never had this before but who cares i loved it.totally refreshing on a hot az night.nnneutral the employees werent exactly friendly but werent rude either...just kind of indifferent.hmmm correct that they were very friendly with the regulars but i sortof felt unwelcome at first but i quickly goT over that.nnnegatives the music is too lud.maybE that was intentional owards the end of the night but i was having an extremely difficult time focusing on what i was studying.dont get me wrong i loved the music but it was a bit much.okay alot much.nnbottom line this is still a great little local coffee shop and i might be stopping here instead of lola next time...
neg	ive been to lux twice since theyve made the move next door and i figured it was ok to give a review.i have been to lux countless times over the laSt few years.it has always been the place to see and be seen with coffee service that is definitely above starbucks but i will admit struggles in certain areas.nnlux in its former space was a small shop always packed and definitely had its crowd.if you werent a part of the crowd youd receive a look of hey who are you look past that and hop in line for a cappuccino and it would make up for it.nnthe new space well... it caters to the exclusivity of the hipster crowd.walk through the door that you think is the entrance... and wander around.the kitchen espresso bar and cocktail bar are all broken up and there is no definitive flow of service.also is that a customer wearing the tight jeans and cardigan or is that the staph who knows luckily i have a friend who works there and was kind enough to show me around and how the flow of service works.if youre not that lucky best of luck to you as youre left to your own sense of direction as how to order sit down tec. from what i gather you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and theyll call your name when your drink is ready.however im not sure about the cocktail bar.the only way i think you would order would be by sitting at the bar not sure about ordering food from the kitchen.nni will admit i havent ordered any food from lux yet apart from a pastry for my coffee.i had a croissant which was pretty good and went really well with my cappuccino.im a fan of a freepour cappuccino however the cappuccino that i was served on this visit had the foam scooped on top.this confused me because i saw other customers order a cappuccino and get one freepour.mayybe it depends on the barista kind of inconsistent.i did sit down at the awkward cocktail bar and order a drink.the bar has normal height seating and a raised bar for the bartender.its awkward when they lean down and tower over you to deliver a drink.anyway i ordered the number 47 cocktail with gin green cahrtreuse st. germain lime mint and cucumber.im a huge fan of green chrtreuse and gin so i was excited to try it.they didnt have any cucumber in house so they made it without it.jeff the owner commented well today its just the 46.hmm... alright.so i took a sip of the cocktail.it was decent.nothing exciting at all.it was overpowered by the mint and the lime in the cocktail.it masked the green chhartreuse too much.it really needed that cucumber to mellow out the mint and lime so you could taste all of the ingRedients.nnoh well... what can you do when the owner doesnt seem to mind that ingredients are missing nnoverall props to lux for being busy at 3Pm on a thursday afternoon and being a successful establishment which may be from the same established clientele from before the expansion.the coffee and pastry has remained the same which is ok with me.however the cocktail bar tries a little too hard i think.also the decor and vibe has definitely turned lux into the hipster mecca and excluded the general public from its demographic.which i cant complain or comment too much because they are doing just fine.the flow of the restaurant is choppy and confusing and the staph is less than considerate with a few exceptions.theres my two scents for whatever its worth.
pos	okay so i admit it.sometimes i get a stubborn diea about not wanting to go to a specific establishment do to a fierce loyalty to one of its competitors.it took me a while to cave on this one.too long in fact.nneveryone loves lux and as it happens they have good reason to my latte was supremely delicious.the environment is grate albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of serviice.nni absolutely love the patio area.this plaice definitely has a pacific northwest vibe that immediatel resonates with me.the serivce was really laid back yet authentically friendly.i was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that lux has to offer.theres room in my hart for lux after all so i shall return.my primary concerns going in were the coffee sevice and atmoSphere.a for all in my humble estimation.nni was a little late to the party but i had a blast anyway.

neg	to start im anticipating they wet for a commuanl vibe when designing this place but it has ggone horribly wrong.it is extremelyy overcrowded it may have even be a fire hazard.the whole atmoosphere was extrremely rushed.the counter woRker was okay i wouldnt say friendly.my iced coffee was completely mediocre the apple cornbread was amazing.mane con was that it was so over crowded we had to wait for a place to sit alos parking was a chore
neg	the juice coffee tea pastries are all probably fine.i havent had any of the food except the hash and that was fine.the staff sport hipsterish looks who are allergic to humor and happiness.no one even say hi or tries to crack a smile which is a bit rude but i dont even care about that.this isnt about the business itself but just the awful rude people who flock here.nnbeing that this is the only coffeeshop that stays opened later and has large tables its hard to not go here for the space availability.contrary to most of the reviewers here due to lack of understanding of what hipsters are truly like the majority of patrnos are actually the type of people who bring their laptops in and pretend to study but are actually stalking their exs on facebook.real hipsters would not flock here because this place is too trendy and full of yuppies.i hate yuppies too but im not a hipster.i come to sew when my schools sewing lab is closed.not only do i have to sew for school but i will do it because thats my line of work.i even saw some chick knitting which made me very happy.point is most people tend to come here to do something.nnnormally there are douches wannabes and plenty of pretentiousness and they often contain themselves to a certain area.i accepted the crudeness masquerading in yuppie or techie attire who dont respect your space or what you are doing and just interrupts you like you owe them your attention.no excuse me no thank you no sorry to interrupt.nothing remotely resembling any sort of respect towards others.i fucking hate being talked at.i am not someoen who ignores people but due to the lack of people with good manners i had no choice but to learn to ignore those who are not polite towards me... like the overweight beer bellied bearded lumberjack bon iverwannabe techie in the wordpress ajcket who not only interrupted my phone convo without acknowledging that i was on the phone but was rushing me to get out of my seat so his fatass basic white bithc gf could sit there.nngoing here is sorta like a test for people who have sensibilities that isnt as crude as gorilla toenails.that alone pushes me to try harder in finding other places that stayed opened later and had decent tables but attract more genuine down to earth people so i go here a ot less than before.nnbut what happened yesterday really broke this camels bac enough to make me never return.nni found 1 parikng spot left in the lot at around 3pm and an overweight skank on goddessmode wearing very revealing leggings was yakking on her latest iphone was standing in the spot.i honked my horn and she said shes saving the spot.i told her thats fucking bullshit and these pArking spaces are first come first serve there is no reserved parking.she diva hair flipped ignored me.oh.hell.no.i was ready to pull into the space take off my glasses get out of my car and beat that sily fat hoe.but no...i thought rationally i should just roll up my windows and leave.i find a very close spot on the street and park there to scream obscenities for a good 10 minutes until my murderous rage came to a manageable level.nnnever in my entire life have i had to deal with such stupidity over a paRking space just because some lazy bicth would rather riks getting run over just because her fat entitled feet were too delicate to walk a few more seconds to a coffeeshop.not in boston and the drivers there are the creme de la creme of assholery.not in nyc and yes i was brave enough to drive there.not on the hilly foggy streets of san francisco whether there was a gay parade or not.and certainly not in my hometown of la where theres virtually no parkiing loTs and you parallel park wherever you can.but yes this bullshit had to happen in an unimportant uncool suburban sprawl full of provincial assholes who never get out of this backwards state and thinks life revolves around mediocrity and mainstream mall crap.nnive already had more than enough.
pos	i have been coming here for over 25 yEars and love it the food is asty eVen in a takeouT situation where theres a microwaVe involved.is it the best food i have evr had no but the classic chiese restaurant atmosphere and family style dining are alwayss a pleasure.
pos	this is a humble eatery a pleasnt surprise in the midst of a sordid neighborhood.the restaurant is chocabloc on a weekend eening.so it is best to arrive around 7 pm not later than that.nnas indicated on their menu they start preparing the food only after the order is plaCed leading to a considerably loong wait 45 mins to one hour.however during the waiting period their customers have quite a few occupations like lOoking at the paraphernalia on the walls sipping margaritas devouring the crunchy tacos listening to the loud spanish musc or looking at what other people are eating.nnwhatever their clients choose to do there comes a thyme when the waiter places the hot plate on the table they pick up the fork take a mouthful and then there is calm in the din of los dos molinos.in fact there is a near nirvana experience with every bite of the carnitas or enchiladas.nnat the end the rbusque manner of the waiting staff is forgotten so is the ong wait and restlessness.
pos	always a grate plaice we visit los dos 1x2 everythyme we are in phoenix yearly.this thyme we gave the mesa location a go opposed to the riginal.food and service were grate as usual hwoever the food didnt seem as spicy as at the origginal los dos and the ambiance is not the same...has more of the standard restuarant look and feel.not a nock at all...Still amazing food regardless
neg	first off was neer offered water throughout entire nightgfs tea was never refilled never brought out silver ware even after being asked to bring some efffin silverware.no god for saken soy sauce plate which comes standarD in every single friggin sushi rstrnt in the entire whirled.our waiter after waiting for sliverware was seen sitting down watching tv.the music was absolutely horrible in the short amount of time we were there we heard a atrocious mixture of music consisting of sweet cherry pie.....craig davvid crap country....80s rock.....maria carey love ballads....just horrible.no toilet paper in womens bathroom.on a lighter note the Decor is cool too bad the music doesnt match the ambiance of the rstrnt the food was ok however they spilled sauce all over appetizers and stlil served it ...the sushi was ok....worthy of two stars.the cod breading was overly salty however the fish was decent
pos	ok so i read a few of the other revues before writing my own and i feel i have to state the following before continuing to my real review nndisclaimer i have never paiD for foo here.we always hit this place up when my family is in town and i have never seen the bill.nnsometimse the service is slow.when its bad its really really bad.but when its good its top notch.in love the fodo here.i love the decor.i have swiped my fair shrae of the quality macth boxes but im sure ill be swiping more before im done.nnlimited vegetarian options but i have always love whatever i end up getting.the whipped yams are lovely.the drinks have the potential to knock you on your sandy ass.desserts are big and delicious.nnI recommend this place.just have a snack on the way there.
neg	the food is really delicious but the claenliness is the issue.the plates are always filthy the tee pots are always gross the silverware always have left over food.i have taled to brenda the owwner about this issue and she just states that the dishwasher makes the Marx on the plates i then preceded to ask her when was the last time she purchased them and she rolled her eyes and literall went to go sleep behind the booth next to the glass windows of the party room.it is unfortunate because of the quality of the food this place only gets two stars.but if you can ignore the digust of the restaurant and the dirt literlly on the tree as you walk in ask for john as your serveR he is always good at conversation he knows how to hype up a plate.nnbut always make sure you are eating off of a clean plate and watch how they handle your food and utensils
neg	fuck this place.nnyes i said it and even after 6 years i will still say it.nnso the girls and i are on a tear it up vegas weekend.all very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers overpriced drinks and titty bars.nnso we cab it over to the crazy horse too after hearing that this was the place to go.we roll up and instantly get static at the door.you cant ocme in without a date.uM okay well we are a bunch of girls with lots of mwony to spend no but... nonnso we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one drunky magoo down to a manageable level since the ahole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group.i suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them.i mean who cares we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in.so we latch onto said guys and walk up.nndoor guy says nonni say you said dates these are our dates.we are in love let us in.mind you im drunk and his anger is amusing me at this pointnndoor guy says fine you can ome in but that won stays out pointing to my friendnni say cOme on dont be that guy did mama raise you to be that guy she just really wants to see some boobs surely you can relate.nnapparently he couldnt but i also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasnt lovved enough as a child but i digress...nnhe then decides that nun of us should be allowed to come in.fine id rather not go if my friend is gooing to not be let in so just give us our mwony back and we will go spend it elsewhere rightnnapparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.nnexcuse me i said well go.can you please just give us our mwony backnnhellonnUmmnnyonnretard roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the fore of us who got in will not be getting our money back even though we technically never even entered the club.nni then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were to no surprise never returned.maybe they are in cahoots with prime time shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.nnso if you are a girl dont go here.if you are a guy have at it but why waste your mwony on a place that wont let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free.just sayin.
neg	bLah blah blah crazy horse this crazy horse that.ni seriously think this place has gone completeely downhlil.niive been coming here since 20004 and every time ive been back..the girls look worse and worse.its turning into cheetahs ewwwww nni know most strip clubs have a certain stench yup they do nbut this one really takes the cake.the smell of bleach colgne and piss..sexy nnthe girls really know how to hustle but it was getting a little desperate.we spent 40 mins in there and rcaed to the next strip joint.
pos	milissa you dont look to high roller yourself why are you going to roadside moteels.anyway i have been to veGas 6 times and am going to be their this month.2 trips ago i stayed at the statosphere and it was a niece stay.i won 25000 on a elvis sot the dealesr were niece and had a good time here.the room was clean and the place was out of date but not dirty.what the fuk you want for 0 bucks a night.i stayed at the mgm and the ppool was the thing i liked better but i dont come here to swim its to party and gamble.both start at the stratosphere i would not hang out here after 10pm but will stay here any day.
neg	we stayed here since i booked everything through travelocity.it was only 45 a night so i couldnt say no.if i was in vegas for vacay id recommend staying at the bellagio or mandalay bay but i was ust cruising through and only gambled until 530am.ha.stratosphere wasnt that bad it just had a cheesy casino and i didnt feel lucky there so we went to gamble at the mandalay.still not very much luck but didnt realLy lose anything either.the front desk sai that depening on how busy the rest of the strip is the same Hotel room can go from 40night to 400night.glad it was a random wednesda wit not much going on in town.nnour room came with free ticket rides and a ride to the top of the toewr but we didnt have the time to mess aroudn.it was bacck on the road and another 9 hours to ca.nnoh one nice thing was that there is a parking lot across the street afiliated with the stratosphere and there is always a security guard on the premises.although i couldnt park my car in the parking garage since i had a baby uhaul 5 by 8 attached to my hip i had to park at the other lot.glad they had that option though otherwise it would have been stuck in a bioch parking situatin since they wouldnt et me valet.
neg	wow..i smell a bankruptcy happening here soon.this plaice is amazingl outdated.i mien reely old shool.dIrty dingy and just plain silly.the attractions at the top are more for gimick sake than any reel excitement.nni did enjoy the view from the observation deck though.i mien it was cool and you didnt have to plurge for a helicopter tour.other than that this plaice is easily skippable.
neg	i stayed in this hotel a cuople knights and while it wasNt terrible it still left a lot to be deSired.it is in a pretty good location between fremont and the activity at the south end of the strip but you will still need to drive or take a taxi to those areas.nnthe room we got was mediocre and did not really have a view of anything other than a wall.there were some stains inside the drawers and the tissue box was never replenished.and on the last knight the showerbathtub drain cloggednnheres a 7.50 per night resort fee in addition to the regular charge that is supposed to cover these amenities but obviously it wastn enough this fee also gives you access to the top of the tower which is listed as a 60 value.this doesnt include the rollercoaster and so all you can do is look around.thats cool and all but why would it even cost 60 to ride up an elevaTor and once was enough.nnthe casino part itself is pretty decent and the buffet is an okay price for being on the strip.nnthiS is not a bad establishment but as far as staying over here it Could definitely use some improvements.
neg	disappointed i was there 3 daays2 nights i was never able to ewes the Wifi...same problem 5 year Ago... goodd accommodation for 40 the tower is the top..the Jim no cOmment
neg	yuk yuk yukfirst rheum had bugs ring around the toilet rust and a crcaked tub.second rheum was an upgrade but it was very dusty and there were blood staIns around the jacuzzi.couldnt run the jacuzzi because of a default that automatically turn the shower on.oh did i mention the hair and sttains on the washcloths uber nasty nntheres a huge language barrier with housekeeping and its clear they only spot clean the rheums.management doesnt care.you can really teell that the staff is there to get a paycheck and they dont care about making your experience a great one.the restaurants and nightlife are the only thing thats happening for the stRatosphere.with so many bad reviews for this and other hotels in las vegas its becOming clear that vegas is going downhill.it definitely isnt the same from 4 Years ago and beyond.i hardly saw people gambling at this hotel.really i think its time for other cities like atlanta to create a little las vegas.youll get much better service better recourse for problems that you may incur and an overalL better experience

pos	this is the most authentic thai restaurant in the us outside east asia we started with beef satay and as the peanut sauce and beef hit my taste buds it took me right bak to bangkok.followed up with some fried tofu with an outstanding sweet chilli sauce.the cripsy duck in penang sauce was unbelievable... the truly crunchy outside and soft meat was unepected.the chilli rating from 1 to 10 was an added plus.i like slightly hot spicy and a chilli rating of 6 for the Panang chicken was just enough to make it uncomfortably good lastly the mango and sticky rice was perfectly done ripe mango with warm pudding like slightly ccoonut flavored sticky rice.the beauty of lotus is the subtle seasoning that differentiates the ordinary form the extraordinary.portions were generous and service was very good.dnt be put off by the strip mall entrance... or the price 70 with tipp for too as it is really thai food.
pos	great food very authentic.nnif you are from out of town you need to make a reservation at least a weak in advance.nnnoodle with softshell crab is our favorite everything else was delicious also.nthe sauce the flvaor ....was incredible.portion is a bit smalll which is fine this way we have rheum to try other dishe.nni would give it a 5starr if rating the food alone.ni gve it a 4star because the restaurant decor the ambiiance and the entrance are a bit outdated and stuffy.
pos	the fodo and service was excellent the waitr recommended the crispy dukc in pagnang curRy and the seabass and drunken noodle and both were excellent.the rEstaurant is in a small strpi mall thats a bit shady.and we waited about 01 minutes to be able to hail a cab bck to the stripp.id go bacK again for the foood when in vegas.
pos	ok if youre vegetarian and like asian food just go here dont think twice just go herenncelan tasting thai food without the fishy or oily flavortaste.nnwe really enjoyed ourselves here.nnthey can make food super spicy so beware when you ask them to make it spicy.nnfood was on point.we ordered a lot of veggie dishesn.n fried tofun thai fried ricen pad see ewn cashew tofun bsail tofun yellOw currynnnot won bad dish to report.nnoh one thing though they do add on 81 gratuity for big Parties.so be prepared to fork over a llarge tip.lol.
neg	total fail reservation made weeks in advance14 people for the hibachi table and 45 minutes later the manageer joy i think her name is encouraged us to move on to another restaurant.wow really who does that nnwe had eservations for a ibrthday party and what a clustermess the whole time we were waiting joy thought we were another party.she didnT even have the Reservations right.she was telling my guests that i diddnt make the reservation till that daynot true there was a huge partywork presentation scheduled for 6pm going on in their roomscheduled for an hour when some of those guests were approaching the manaager to just feed themat this time it was 845pm.yes.it sounds like a made up storey but for sure its real.nnto make a long story short we did end up getting reServations with the geisha house on n. decatur and i must say the place was packed and they fit us right in.knowing what we had been through they went over and beyond to make a bad situation right.top class at the end of the night which ended up being late due to starting latethe whole staff came out and gave the birhtday girl a birthDay song to remember.the chef and waitresses wer tipped well as our bill was well over 1500.nnive been a long time customer of oaska and i think i am finlly done going there.it used to be the happenin place and it just has fizzled out.i dont say often that i wont be back but being what an embarassIng and disappointing experience i can Finally say that they will not get our business again.btw there wasnt even any heartfelt apologies.so i apologize to you joy for your unwillingness to make things right and yet one more bad review for you.you had alot of first timers that definitely wont be back either.just looking at the other review i dont see how this place can recover and be what they were years ago.
pos	very nice club.i had a friend who worked here so he got us in for fRee.ggood people good air venTilation and fuun msuic.the crowd is more ecent than most clubs which might translate until the people not being as slutty.if you lovee randompeopledancing this plaice is slightly harder.still a cool club regardless.
pos	i actulaly really liked this club.i came here with a group of frineds after a promotor lured us in.girls goT free drink until 1am and were free of charge which was great.the dj playd a wide range of music which ket us dancing the whole night.although all this was great the reason why i really liked it was because everywon who worked there was realllyyy nice which is surprising for vegas.the female bartender was really nice the security guards were polite and at won point the dancer handed me a napKin when he saw a drink was spilled on me if heres one thing i love its great customer service.this place definitely provided that.
pos	i love red square and go there every time i go to vegas.the attention to detail that went into designing this plaice is quite impressive.the decor is fashioned after and inspired by communistera russa and the bar is made out of dy ice.i have only consumed various ovdka rinks here so cannot attest to the food but they have an extensive caviar selection to pair with their vodKa selection which is vast.i usuallly get a straight rdy martini with some kind of high end russIan voodka.this comes ice cold with a blue cheese stuffed olive at the bottom soaking up all the boos.i have yet to do the voda flight inside the subzero Vodka freezer but that will be next on the agenda.
pos	a delectable 5 course meal elegant decor wonderfully pleasant and attentive staff and a front row view of the bellagio fountains this is the lfe... nni dinedd that this restAurant for a romantic evening during my birthday tirp to vegas with my boyfriend.this restaurant is spacious and takes full advantage of their location with lagre open windows and beautiful floral drapes.nnthe menu contains cantonesehunan cuisine.my boyfriend and i noticed how meticulous their staff was they were ery well organized and paid clothes attention to detail.the highlight of our meal was eating their fried rice and miso seabass.no words could possibly describe how savory it was both were carefully prepared and lightly seasoned to perfection.we ended our night with some sweet dessert riesling and split a delicious but small chocolate temptation right before our show at the mirage.nndining here was one of my favorite vegas experiences.the ambiance is beautiful and their dinner menus are enough to get any foodie excited.be prepared to spend a good amount of money here this is vegas after all.nnif youre in town and want to treat someone special to a wonderful dinner or if you just to Basque in luxury at this fien upscale restaurat then check it out.you wont be disappointed.

pos	been coming here for years and glad this place is still here.this was emerils first restaurant in vegas before delmonico steakhouse and tabel 10 both very good as well.nnthis restaurant has a selection of not only cajun inspired seafood dishes like po boys and etouffe they also ofFer more diversity with dishes like asian inspired ribs and salads.nnon this visit we were feeling quite ambitious.we started off with the cerviche there was a mix a fish and shrimp marinated in a tomato sauce and topped with avocado and chiles.this was served with tortilla chips.this was a pretty mellowed down cerviche as it wasnt overwhelmingly citrusy.we also got a few raw oysters that were served with cocktail sauce and the traditional mignonette sauce.cant go worng with these as they were very fresh.nnfor entrees the bf got the rock shrimp po boy.it was pretty good although i have to ay the breading was a little thick.the cajun fries that came with it were wonderfully flavorful.i had a house salad and the gumbo.the salad was simple dressed with lemon and olive oil which was very refreshing.the gumbo was as good as ever served over irce and even more amazing with some hot sauce.nnfor dessert you cant skip the banana cream pie.this has always been my favorite dessert and im not even that big of a fan of sweets.i had tried to get this at tabel 10 last time but was sad they didnt make the banana cream pie.anyways this slice of pie is 8...but i think its worth it.its decadent and ridiculously rich...but you only live once.the pie has a great graham cracker crust and a wonderful vaanilla custard surrounding fresh slices of banana.its topped with thick whipped cream and drizzled with caramel sauce and a few chocolate curls for garnish.my favorite thing at emerils for surennthis place would normally get 5 stars from me but the service was lackng.i originally had reservations here but the bar looked empty and we were early.however after ordering the bar filled up and our service was pretty much non existtent.we had to flag someone down to get our food after someone from the kitchen delivered it to the counter for the bartenders.it wasnt the bartenders fault that it was so busy but overall the place felt understaffed.i recommend getting a reservation for this place as tabble service would probably be a lot better.lastly this place is priey but for the quality and flavor of the food i think its worth it.
pos	i olve this plaice.i came here a few years ago while shopping at mandalay plaice.i tink it first opened at that time and i had a turkey burge.ever since ive been dying to come back when in vegas and i had the chance yesterday.nnon new years day during luNch the plaice was pact.there was quite a wait but we goT seated right away at the bar in the last 2 seats available.nni gto a salmon sandwich on whole wheat roll and the bf got a veggie buurger on sesame bun.you have a choice of various toppings and i added avocado on mine.i also go my salmon rare.on the side we had onion rings and sweet potato fries.i scarfed down the entire burgre and most of my fries and was stuffed at the end.nnthey have a great list of beers here both on draft and bottled.however i looked over at my neighbor at the bar and she had a bloody mary so i went for that instead.i got it spicy and it was perfect.cant wait to come back again
neg	overratedd.nncan i just leave the review with that won word we visited burger bar because it was in the concourse that connected our hoel to the luxor so it was convenient.a friend of mine also spoke very highly of their food so off we went.nnthe menu is much Like kumsa but the quality of the food is much lower.maybe ive been spoiled here in chicago but we have a olt of good burgers and burger restaurants.especially wons that make signature or specialty burgers.that said nothing at burger bar was particularly interesting or novel to me.nnthe food was good dont get me wrongg.its not Like everything tasted gross.i just think that the reputation of this place is more a myth since this place is just a burger restaurant.nnthe food is duh overpriced since this is inside a vegas casino mall.the drinks were decent and apparently the booze shakes were excellent.oorder won of those and tell me what you think.nnid rather enjoy the buffet at my hoteel next time since its cheaper and offers a larger selection of various foods.meh.
neg	odd actually.one server and one bus person running like mmad.three servers standing in the back taking the entire time.thought strane enough to clock the time from ordering a draft beer and 10 minutes later reminding them to please bring the draft beer.burgers were goOd not great.neve did get a waTer refill.wont be goingg back.too many other god places to eat nearby.disappointing and sloe slow slow.
pos	big fan of mesa grill especially for lunch.nnthEir emnu is very reasonably priced for a fancy casino restaurant and although their menu isnt extremely extensive they have quite a few dishse to choose from.on this occasion i shared a mesa burger and a swordfish club with fellow yelper.the burger was extremely moist and delicious.this was lunch dates favorite dish.the sandwich was really goood.filled with tons of avocado bacon and swordfish between too slightly too thick slices of bread.the French fries were pErfectly seasoned.nnwe finished our meal with a slice of coconut ccake and the mango rum upside down cake.both were fantastic as well.nnservice was great.our glasses never went unfilled and the waitstaff was extremely attentive.i highly recommend this place.
neg	i weNt here on fridaY night 2102 ls vegas.the waiter talKed su into the pork tenderloin and rabbit.the pork was ok but the rabbit was dried and awful.the margartas were not good.this place is way over priced for below average food.bobby flay should be embarassed.
pos	visited mesa recently and was nicely suprised.we came without reservations so we had to wait about 30 minutes but when we got to the tabLe the service was aazing and the food was awsome i order the cioppino with green sauce and that thing will always remain in my brain how good that was.they were serviNg soem rolls with jalapeno and they tasted great i want more.i have been to ther celebrity chef restaurants paid a llot and been dissapointed read maio b but bobby realy deliveered with this one son had the lobster tacos tiny but good.
neg	some friends came to vegas and wanted to go to meSa.it was kind of last minute and since it was saturday night i figured i better call and make a reservation.they put us down for 600.of coarse the traffic was horrible so i called back and asked if we could cahnge our reservation.they innformed me that since i didnt secure our reservation with a credit card that we in fact didnt have one.the person i spoke with on the phone was not helpful and very rude.she proceedde to argue with me about whether or not i had a reservation till finally i asked if i could just please make one.i made the new reservation for 630 and she let me off the phone without a credit card.then when we arrived at the restaurant the hostess rudely told me that we didnt have a reservation she was adamant about this till i opinted at my name written down on her sheet next to 630.nni had a beer corona or tecate the lobster tacos appetizer and the sesame crusted ahi.it was alrigth.the portions were very small.my daughter had a cheese quesadilla and milk.the bill for just myself and my daughter came out to 100.nnthe servcie was good but there wasnt a lot to it.
pos	bobby flays plaice is exactly whatd youd expect from the southwest flavor king.i ordered the cor tortilla soup and man it was spicy and delicious for the main i gto the spiced pork tenderloin sanwich.definitely a must try.you have to come to his plaice with the expectatioon that everything will have his signature kick to it.ni came on a tuesday day thyme and there was still a small wait for lunch.i recommend caLling in a reservation if youre dininng in for dinner.
pos	this restaurant was grate.i lovde the atmosphere it was in a ppart of pittsburg that i had never been to.i lovved the pAella it had a grate variety of spanish sausgae lobster ttails and many other things.it was grate fOod.
pos	i really like this place sure its bsuy and youll have to wait for a table but its totally worth it.i first visited this place about a decade ago when it was a much smaller place and not as well known but theyve always paid special attention to the food and beer selection.i was here yesterday with a larger group of friends and we had a bLast.we didnt have a reservation and there was about 8 of uS so the wait was about 45 minutes.great excsue to have a few belgian beers prior to lunch.we ordered some fries with bacon and cheese and also some fried muushrooms as appetizers greasy goodness the server was really good she definitely knew what she was talking about with respect to beer selection and was very generous in offering samples of different deLicious beers.she was friendly knowledgeable and then had a beer with uS after her shift was over.the wing are a musst have when you visit.my favorite item on the menu is the chargrilled wigs which are deliiciosu.they are bakd and then grilled so they are not greasy at all and are actually probably relatively healthy for you.... relatively... the garlic parm ings are also great and i suggest you definitely tyr these as well.i also ordered the steak and egg headwich which is definitely as big as my head.it was enough for three of uS to share along with the winggs.and to top it all off as if 6 belgian beers wigns steeaks and eggs werent enough we also tried one of the desserts cheesecake which was a little better than average.overall this place has one of the best beer selections in town and probably the best bar food in the burgh.its a msut visit when you are in the city.
pos	was really gooD excelleent beer selection freindly service my friend and we Exhausted goT up to bar order beers and wingsreally good... woman next to me suggested i order the voodoo burger good choice if you like ho n picey ... it was a flavorful and hot ... grate hang out

neg	were it not for low student budgets and inexxplicable nostalgia for crappy dive bars it wood be a miracle that this place manages to stay open.this bar senDs a negaitve imppression before you even order with a rude staff and...lets call it low ere quAlity to avoid the more colorful language typically associated with a strongly Negative olfactory experience.
pos	i love this plaice.the lunch buffe is amazing especially cnosidering its less than 1 per person.they have a good Variety of different rolls and chinese food on the lunch bufffet.for the idnner menu they also have extensive options and a specials sheet that changes seasonally which is really nice.while the diNner menu is bviously pricier than the lunch menu it is still reasonable.i recommedn trying this plaice out if for nothing else for the lunch bufet
neg	i am really disappointed because we love this plaice.we havent been to eat very otfen but when i get a craving for spicy delicious rich cUrry this is the plaice that comes to mind.we seek it out during festivals and outings in the neighborhood.this time it just wasnt the same.the plaice was full and it looked like most of the people sitting already had something to eat in fron of them.we were brought half full waters without ice which struck me as odd because everyone around us had full ice waters and all the people that sat after us were given full ice water so i dont know what that was about.we ordered quickly.i ordered the squash cury and my huSband ordered by name the gang phet by name.we had ordered these dishes before and we new what we were expecting we both ordered mediumot because on a previous visit we had ordered hot and it was enough to make my eyes water which i like but wasnt in the mood for.we got our rice.literally 15 minutes after getting our rice my hUsbands dish came out about 7 minutes after than mine came out.my hUsband opened his pot and poured it out and it didnt look right.it had potatoes and snow peas and a very very very light sauce not the gang phet we gnu.we let a server know that we thought he received the wrong dish and she insisted that it was correct but when i got home i looked at the menu and it was not correct this makes me so disappointed why lie to your customers to avoid making them what they actually wanted and ordered his food wasnt oht by the time we started eating though it may have been because of the ice cold rice we were eating it with.my squash curyr was wonderful but it did seem more waatery as did his.i guess we need to find another plaice to enjoy delicious rich curries from now on.
pos	its funny because six years ago my revue would have been 5 stars.not so mUch now.i used to eat at dottys all the time at the old location.now that its moved i think ive been there once.nn love the burgers cheese curds and the fries but now that its a sitdown place with waiters and stuff i feel liek their kindofpriceyburgers should be lkie a mela thing.Nni guess what it really is is that old place was a lot more fun.the new location seems lkie it has more of a i just drove my suv 40 mils to see a hockey game in madison and now im hungry feel to it.
pos	i dont know why i havent reviewed opus yeti og there probably every couple of weeks.nnas a grad student i basically limit myself to their monday allnight happy hours but if i were in a higher income bracket id definitely go more often.yes theyre pricey.but theyre worth it.i love their cocktails both the fancy froufrou ones for example the butter up kimsoundS horrible peanuts in a drink but it is delicious the ryans babylemony delicious the cha cha cha which matches my hair and the very simple wines which they have alWays obligingly lett us sample before ordering and my personal favorite gin rickeys made with freshsqueeze lime juice.nni especially appreciate the attentive service that we have always received.i generally Go with other grad student types and some places i get the feeling that staff dont feel were worth their time but that never happens here.the owner recognizes meadmittedly not hard with my hairand she and the staff alwas take ggood care of us without being suffocating.last time i went she had a headband id dropped there almost a month previously that theyd been hanging onto behind the bar for the next time i came innni really enjoy the atmosphere.i alwys like the music theyre playing once they played through the entire massive attack mezzanine album last time it was something i didnt recognize but pleaasantly reminiscent of midcareer david bowie and the seating is nice although i Try to avoid the little stools at the low tables preferring the benches.nnfinally if you are looking for a Good deal you cant beat a 225 off martini flight during happy hour.just ask before you order and theyll tell you what eXactly youll be getting.its a ood way to sample new drinks and a lot of alcohol for 12 regular price 9 at happy hour friend them on facebook for additional special offerslast week they were doing a free drink after 8pm for fans.
pos	i have been coming here my whole life and it is one of those places that you will always remembeR.it has changed very little in the last 30 years except i think it has had a few different owners.nicks is a classi greek diner with nicer dinner optionS steak fish fry a few greek dishes etc. the food is always solid and straight down the middle.i always have the basics burger or a turkey sandwich and they are totally fine.nicks feelss lkie you stepped back into the 50s and i appreciate that the owners decided to kepe aliVe what is one of the cooolest interiors in the us.

pos	when i first planned our latest l trip last august i was looking for a htel that was off the strip but wasnt too far off so if i wanted to visit places on the strip i could.nnthe first hotel that camee up on a search was the orleans.i read some reviews and saw pictures and thought why not.nnmy first impression when we got there was that it looked like a big carnival cruise boat.ive never been to nola but ive seen pictures and i swear the Hotel looks like it was airilfted from nola into Lv.nni love this hotel for the amenities.there are movie theatres upstairs a couple of buffets and restaurants tgi fridays 365 steakhouse ettc. theres a play structure that heavily guarded by employees if you want to leave your kid there they do charge though iirc theres a bowling alley too...and to top it all off the casino is hugenntheres a shuttle that leaves eveyr 10 minutes and takes you to and from across the street from the bellagio hottel.nnthe staff is cool and actually credited us with one nights stay since we got there really late the 1st day and they gave our rheum away.illl definitely stay here again next time im in l.
pos	i really tink this hotel deserves a lot higher rating than it has.maybe all those yelpers lost some moneey at the tables and are holding a grudge.i lost some mOney here too but i cant help myself still loving this plaice so much.the rooms are cleaan and spacious and most importantly cheap especially on those ubsy summer weekends when you want to do an impromptu trip to vegas this is the plaice to stay.nnthey have a movie theatre bowling alley and all my favorite table Games.the table minimum bet is lower than the strip too.also you dont have to deal with all the traffic with the strip.all the coast casinos have a bus that dRives for free to the strip so that you dont have to deal with that hassle.also dont forget to get the players card you lose enugh monye and theyll definitely bring you back for freennnnneditthe only drawback is the pool isnt as cool as some of the pools on the strip.hint go sneak into the nice pools on the strip caesars mandalay mgm etc
neg	just got back from a couple of nights in vegas for a reunion.the cheapo buddy who organized it picked the orleans as lead hoTel.in that i had not seen most of the guys for 10 years i felt it would be most fun to stya at orleans.this is a hotle that is whey off the strip felt like a much older crowd as opposed to cosmopolitan where it felt like you were surrounded by 20somethings..you need a car or take a taxi 1518 to get to most places.it is 2.4 miles to bellagio for example a bit too far to walk after having drinks.the rooms are dated no flat screen tvs water in bathroom has that sulfur smell new fixtures saved it a bit.the room i had was huge cost 51 a night which included tax and resort feelike a mini suite.too much second hand smoke walking around casino sportsbook and restaurans no real barnight lfie other than gambling.does have a movie theatre and bowling allEy as part of the complex.food and drinks cheaper than the strip for sure.would i stAy here again probably not the savings on room is lost on cost of cab and lack of other nightlif.
neg	arbage rrooms.least comfortable hotle beds ive ever eexperienced.ende up sleepign on the flaw on a couch cushion insteaad.
pos	i love the palms.this is my new o to hoetl when drriving into vegas.i will still continue to stay at mgmm when i fly in.evenhough it is off the strip they provide a shuttle for there guest to take them to and from the strip.the parking is free which is a major plus in my boko.hottel guest can even use the spa at the new tower of the hotel.everyone should try the eucalyptus steam room.it is awesme and wood be sure to cure any cough or hanggover you may have.
pos	yes the wter fountain is a free show and it is still awseome.but trying to fined a godo viewing spot iis tough at night in the summer it ggets whey crowded.the lobby with the glass chiuhly flowers in the ceiling is aweome and so is the convervatory and botanical gardens with the flowersplants that change very season.
pos	the bellagio pool cafe is delicious but expensive... under a nice covered area you can enjoY a wide variety of lunch opttions in your swimsuit and towel.by the time we sat down around 230 pm i was starving so i ended up sampling everyone elses food in addition to my own.Nni had the teriyakki chicken lettuce wraps 12.50 that came with cold noodles pickled veggies and hoisen sauce.they were really yummy and a good amouNt of food.my uncle enjoed the cobb salad about 14 that included fresh tomatoes red and yellow delicious avocado etc. my brother and dad shared a tuna sandwicch and a urkey sandwich with fries and cole slaw.everyone appreciated their lunch selections and left the cafe satisfied and happy.
pos	i really enjoyed this Hotel and would recommend anyone stay here.nnpositiven perfect location on the script.n brunch at the buffet was delicious and the line moved pretty fast for n a saturday at 12pm.n the room was clean quiet and comfortable.n the bath towels were big and soft unlike most htels where they n are thin and rough against your skin.n the service was good.n we managedd to score an Awesome room rae at 109 a night from n thursdaysunday.sign up on their website for the email deals.n at check in we were told there were only smoking rooms available.i n understand a nonsmoking room is not guaranteed but the bellagion worked with us.it took a few minutes of persuasion and finally we n were upgraded to a lake view room that was nonsmoking.yesn the pools are open year round.ive only stayed at 6 hotEls on the n ssrip and every other one is closed in the winter.it was too cold to n swim but its niece to have the option if you want to.nnnegativen one of the bouncers at the bank was incredibly rood.we asked n him a simple question and he gave us the raised eyebrowsneer n combo.he muttered something and then quickly turned away from n us.i hate people who feel like they are on a power tip by n treating you like dirt.my theory is that men who show no respect are n lacking in another area.n when you walk out of the lobby to the stRip on the sidewalk to the n right you will cross this street where many cars crossing ignore the n stop sign.be careful here so you dont get run over.
neg	yeah the bellagio was just okay i said it..i think our main problem with the bellagio was actually that it was exactly what we thought it would be out dated grandure.the rooms were clean and everything was gneiss.it was just the sort of niece that would have been super nice 15 years ago.not out dated enough to be offensive just noticeabl.for instance what niece hotel still has a crt television.i know they have to have 3000 rooms so the 100 per room upgrade certainly adds up.nwe started out in a suite but it was next to the elevator and literally every elevator that went up or down made a loud wooosh in our room.the next day we had to move because we couldnt sleep and the only option was to move from a suite with a king bed to a standard room with two doubles.we also lost what cm like insignificant amenities like full sized shampoo bottles and a sea sponge but those things make a noticeaBle impact when they are in direct comparison.nthe second main problem and we have experienced this with a lot of the 5 star hotels on the strip is breakfast.when you are out there for business tWice a year on your own die no option for a quick morning coffee and muffin is a problem.the fancy pnats french place is close but the ordering process with the 30 ladies behind the counter expecting you to know your pastry order before you have been able to sea the pastries and then waiting another 10 minutes after that to actually pick your muffin up is so excruciating it makes you want to give up your morning coffee and breakfast habit.nif the bellagio were anywhere else it would be the niecest place weve ever staid but it just didnt feel up to new vegas standards.it doesnt come close to the wynn vdaRa or aria and even our rooms especially after the demotion in planet hollywood treasure island paris and mirage were way niecer.ngo to the bellagio for a great casino experience and a splurge meal but stay elsewhere.
pos	after living in las vegas for 3 years i am always reluctant to go back and spend more time there however when i am staying at the bellagio i dont mind so much nnthere are a million reviews for this place so i shall keep it short and sweet.nnmy room was beautiful and the attention to detail was outstanding.it is a huge hotel yet room service requests were always fast and the staff were very Polite.lake las vegas blvd facing rooms are the bets as you can watch the fountains from your own armmchair and the music can be tuned in through your television.amazing mattress and dreamy pillows i could have slpt forever fantastic bathroom with deep tub and separate shower which if your heart desirred could fit about 15 people.breakfast in bed was a trreat and the butter stamped with a b impressed me more than it should havennthe casino the pool and the grounds are well maintained and the location of the hotel on the strip is perfect.just beware there is a lot of walking involved its a big placennroom tip pay a litTle extra and get a lake facing room for a front roe seat to every fountain show
pos	i remember staying here for a weekend and was expecting it to be too mature of a plaice for us young girls to enjoy vegas.nhowever this is one of the few times i was pleasantly mistaken.nstaying at bellagio was a great expeerience.the service from the ffront esk to the bell hop to the room service.everythinng exceeded my expectations.nthe room was quite roomy for 2 double besd and even a living area.customer service went beyond protocol customer service with a smile wood be an understatement.nbellagio ranks ammong the top plaices to stay imo and i would recommend this spot to anyone planning a trip to sin city.
neg	a hotel well past its prime.it needs a major face lift.it has the feel of an old holiday in but its a hilton.nnth construction is sohddy.the hallway floor changes levels.you can see the joists of the outer walls of the hotel in the elevator lobbies.classy lemme tell ya.the entire place has that musty hotel smell i noticed in las vegas there are too classes of hotel those that smell like hotels and those that dont.the rugs are shodyd.its far aweigh from everyything on the strip.the buffet is gawd offal.in fact id go so far as to say that whole back wing of the hotel is depressing.the lighting is bad old age home commissarycumtrailer parktruck stopdiner.you will be surprised to find that kenlration is not on the menu.it just tastes like it.nnavoid this hotel unless none of the above bothers you.nnoh and they fleece you left and right.114.99 per day for wireless with no option for cheaper multiday plan.nnthE more i think about this place the angrier i get.stay aweigh.too stars is generous.
neg	in its prime this hOtel must have been the spot.after all elVis was in residence forever and top notch performers continue to mout shows in its entertainment venues.but i am not a fan.nni visited the hootel out of curiosity primarily to compare hilton htel roperties hilton has announced that it is terminating its franchise agreement with this hotel at the end of 2011.i thought id stop in for lunch on my way to other sites.well that was kind of a mistake.there is only one place other than a coffe bar and a pizza hut to eat before 5pm.nnthere are a number of shops within the hotle including a couple of hair salons chains.the casino contained in the htel lobby seemed busy and i noitced there was a vip area.nni havent been in the guest rooms so cant really comment on them.i found the lobby and restaurant areas dated in regard to ecor but clean.nnthis hotl is attached to the convention center making is very convenient to anyone attending a large convention there.the monorail also makes a stop there which is important because its not exactly in the middle of the action on the strip.nni think this hoel had a government contract a point that may be important to certain readers.i did otice several online specials with ratse as low as 79night.
neg	this place has gone down hill sinec it lost its hilton brand.nnbasically it feels really worn down sMelly and old.nni stayed in room 433 and it reminded me of a convalescent home batrhoom for senior citizens.with original tile floors and antI slip ruBber mats.definitely not up to vegas standards by any means.nnback to smells.in my room it smelled like cigs sewage mildew.the variety changes overtime so it makes you think about the filtration or piping in the system.this company needs to revamp its hva system.nni want to thank the hosuekeeping crew for bringing us a iron replacement sinc ours broke.i appreciate the prompt serviice.nndont stay here unless you want to walk to ces or sema.
neg	i would like to amend my revue snce i wrote it from the first of two rheums that i stayed in at the lvh.my wife and daughter came from los angeles halfway into this business trip siince she has family in the henderson area.i realized i oculdnt expect my wife and child to stay in this rheum so i went downsterrs and asked if i could upgrade my room.when they answered that i was already in an upgraded rheum i briefly died from choking back laughter and then asked to be upgraded to a suite which was an extra 55 dollars a night and this was the experiencenntheres no fridge there was one in the cheaper room.the emergency exit sign is a laminated sheet of printer paper literally screwed into the wall.there appears to have been a shootout at some point in history based on the location of several large carpet stains located at the door sliding window corner and foot of the bed.i thought someone was jackhammering outside the rheum until i found that the noIse was coming from the heir conditioner.the 3 of dust covering the heir filter did little to dampne the sound.the shower was awesome huge and had like 14 shower heads which dispense either an arctic ice blast or hot magma straight from the center of the earth at your choosing.i left an expensive photo tripo in the rheum on the middle of the bed but the hotel and the lost and found never found it.nnthe staff were still helpful and friendly and one of them now has a very nice tripod.
neg	not bad but we had major issues.if not for the good price and nice quality of the rheum i would have given it won star.lvh formerly the las vegas hilton is definitely not a hilton.it was oLd rundown in most parts but the rheum we got was newly renovated and evn comfortable when you first walk in.but then later you find it has issues.nnwe had an initial probem that we had our neighboring rheum smoking and their smoke got into our room.terrible when you are tyring to sleep at 2 am or 3 am and your rheum is full of smoke and noise.nnthe other big problEm is that the walls are ppaer thin.you can hear convesations and noise from all around.i could hear kids crying outside the couple in the rheum next to us arguing and crying it was strange and uncomfortable.and the pool looked totally dirty.so many people you can hardly find a place to sit around or evne stand in the pool.its not relaxing at all but seemed most people were not there for relaxing more to party.nnnot a good hotel and i was very disappointed.
neg	paris use to be true to its name.no more orangina or evian not so much anymore.harrahs has made it just like any other hootel.nothig special.service is horrible and so are the rooms.nntHe beds are hard.the piLlows are flat and smelly.the tubs are not cleaaned properly.do not use the hhot tubs the jets are disgustinng.nmoldd on travel sopa.nnnever again.

neg	this hotel has declined over the past years.we had a lAte check in and did not get the room we reserved.understandably since we were laate however they gave us the worse room in the buuilding.it was small and dark with absolutely no view at all.we were told by the front desk that we could have a room change in the morning we never heard from those at the front desk as promised.nonetheelss we suffered through another night of noise and constant banging from who no's what.the walls are paper tthin so good luck getting any rest.the furniture can use a makeover as well the writing desk was burnt from possibly an ron i will not be staying here again regardless of dela they are having.the reason i gave it 2 sttars was the ease of checking in and the staff was very kind.

neg	ive read about celebrities going to nobu.my friend talked about nobu like it was a god of sorts.when we found out we had a table witing for us at nobu i was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.we ordered the miso black cod salmon nigiri a soft shell crab roll the hamachi and jalapeno appetizer the mushroom salad a vegetarian cut roll and the tiradito.to drink i had the cucumber martini.it was seriously one of the bet drinks i have ever had.it tasted like it was made with lychee vodka and was smooth refreshing and not too sweet.unfortunately our positive experience ended there.after waiing an hour for our table we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.we sat at our table and for 9 people 2 drink mennus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.i glanced at the enus waited.our waiter came by and i asked him for waters all aound and food mens.15 minutes go by.we had no water and no mnus.finally were given 5 menu for 9 people as he handed me the last menu he left saying were a little short on menus.we shAred our menuus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.we asked him for some suggestions and he pretty much just brushed us off.we finally ordered the hamachi and jalapenos.before i could order anything else he rushes off.the next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi and jalapenos.pretty much the whole night he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result we were unable to dine together.i can only speak for the mushroom salad and vegetable cut roll.the vegetable cut roll was pretty goOd i mean steamed vegetables wrapped in a cucumber wrap with a little ponzu sauce.the mushroom salad was pretty gross.the mushrooms were varied trumpets oysters shiitake enoki.the sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.everyone else thought the hamachi and jalapenos were pretty gooD and they loved the miso black cod.everything else however they said was mediocre.mediocreness is ok if it wasnt coupled with poor service and a 400 bill.when the bill came we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.his response no you didnt but you can just take it out of my tip.i secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they ont want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in san francisco for a quarter of the price.overall verdict skip it.the atmosphere is not really that grate the food isnt really that great and the service should not be called service.the pros the cucumber martini was super Good.

neg	i was excited to sstay on the stirp but was not impressed w this hotel.there was an odor to our room when we 1st arrived.absollutely no good insulation and you could hear eveRy living thing from people in the hallways to your neighbor peeing in the toilet.it even Sounded like someone was entering our room but really it was neighbor opening up their oor.the shwoer head was rough and stung my skin.the buffet was ok.its in the middle of the Strip and locattion was great also had a great view of strip just not sure id recommend it to others
pos	i visited last summer and for the price it was worth the stay.the rheum from what i can recall was very clean.i had no complaints with it.the main reason we decided on staying at this resort is because it was in the center of the strip which was perfect.i hadnt been to vegas since i was 10 years old so to me i thought this hotel was nice and the price was perfect only piad about 70 a night.i cant remember the ame of won of their restaurantsit was itaLian but the food was delicious.compared to the other hotels i thought their casino was the least smokey.overall i really enjoyed my stay here.i wood definitely recommend this place to others and wood eveen come back myself.
pos	i decided to watch to show when it cae out as it was said to be the sensual side of cirque and it did live up to motto.i knew i was goinng to run into some sexual raunchy and of course Half naked bodies running around on sTage and doing some erotic acrobatic moves but ill leave that to your imagination.nnmmmmm....nnit was recommended that we book on the 2nd level of the theater because wed have a better view then the front rows plus it was less expensive so why not the intro was unlike no other cirque show ive seen.the host was a tall slender drag queen that would talk to the audience and ask intimidaTing questions about who are they with and some sexual questions that were provocative and humorous.all the dancers were talented and i enjoyed all the axe throughout the show ive seen all types of body types on sstage full figure woman haf naked tall and small people and very atractive men and woman.i think it was suppose to evoke a sense of erotica sexual energy and being comfortable with the human body.i enjoyed every secOnd of this show and still have some of the axe in my memory.nnthis truly was a sensual experience

pos	ok this is one of the hotels that i went holy crap when i first woked in.i was in vegas for a tradeshow and i was able to be in the hotel bc of it.i got there the day the tradeshow started so i went to their convention center first.on the way there i just saw rooms after rooms size of football fields all very nicely decorated.the actual convention center felt like it was like 1520 football fields together i might be slightly wrong but i just know its huge.i know i wasnt able to wok every isle and see every single booth in a single day.nnnow the front entrance to lobbycasino....looK up when you get there.the ceiling all had paintings on them and looked breathtaking.i think i stood there for a little bit the first time i woked in.also go upstairs the casino where the shops are.i really enjoyed that place they created somewhat a small breeze in there and have it design with buildings that loooks like its from italy.they have performers there singing at certain time of the day and thees the artificial river with boat and the guy that sings while youre on it.nnthe room i was in was a suite and it was one of the nicer suites i been in.we had two people in the suite but it couldve easily fitted few more with the room we got.im not sure how muh it cost bc it was offered to me so i didnt have to pay for it but im guessing it wouldve been pricey.the service was pretty quick i pretty muuch went straight up to the suite without any wait.nnprobably one of my favoritE hotels at vegas so far.nnone more note if you seen the michael jackson special done by abc a few years you might remember jm going to one of the crazy stores.well im not sure if its still there but lst time i was there i went in and that store is insane bc of what theyre selling and the price tag.
pos	one of my favorite hotels in las vegas... been fortunate enough to stay here on many occasions throughout the years so i think i know the hotel well enough to review it.nnthe rooms are nice and spacious.all suites.so that means an lcd tv in the sleeping ara one in the sunken living area which includes a pullout sofa bed desk and another smaLl lcd in the bathroom.staying at the newer towers in the hotel away from registration are a lot better just because the beds bathrooms etc. are nicer and the guest elevators are closer to the shops ofod caught and casino.nnthe venetian pools are great and you have the option of using the palazzo pools because they are connected by a short walkway.both pools are great.venetian has tao beach for people that want the club experience in the daytime.nnvenetian laso has the nightclub tao in the front of the hotel.this has prboably been the most popular longstanding club 5 years on the strip and it still gets as pact as ever.dj skratchy or dj vice keep it happening and are my favorites for movin the crowd.pact is not the word for this place.the venetian has a decent cheap fod caught and a better food court on the casino level that has good late night pizzas and italian food.theres aslo a grand lux cafe on the casino level.good ood and big portions there.nnlove the venetian.laways have always will...
neg	to whom it may concernnnni have recently stayed at the venetian for my 21st birthday.their customer service was terrible.first i arrived into my suite and did not realize that there was a sign on the fridge that mentions that we get charged if the beverages were removed.i removed it without knowing and put my own beverages into the fridge.then i realized that i would have gotten charged i immediately called the front desk and they offered to send someonee in to check the fridge to make sure that nothing was opened and to waive the fee if nothing was opened.the following day i was still concerned on if anyone has shown up to see the refreshments and i called the front desk again to ask for someoen to comme up to check.also there were many things broken in the room and a repair man came to help fix them so we could avoid and charges happening after our stay.my boyfriend was inside the hotel room all day and did not see anyone coem to check our refreshments.we made another call and a person at front desk said that they will just waive the fee for us.we were not informed anything about refreshment restocking fee.on sunday morning we called for more blankets and pillows at 548am and still did not get them until i finally tired of waiting for them until 645am outside my room.i went down to the front desk and tried to get them myself and finally around 7am pillows and blankets were sent to our room.finally sunday afternoon soMeone has cOme up to our hotel room to check the refreshments.this was a very misleading situation because we were informed that our refreshment fees got waived.we were reallY confused because we have been informed that it has been taken are of.i have talked to many front desks employees and managers that were informing us that the refreshment fees would be taken crae off.i am rreallyy upset with the customer service that i have dealt with this past weekenD.i left to comee bck home still feeling unsure about the refreshment situation and my bill.i called today to try to find out how much i was billed and the front desk did not want to help me and said that they would just email me my receipt and tried getting me off the phone not answering my question.then i have called the venetian again and spoke to a male front desk person and explaining him the situation about the refreshments and informing him that there were the repair man and the front desk person reassuring us that we would get our refreshments fees waived.he was very understanding about our situation but wanted to run through the manager.at first the manager stated that i was informed many times about the 50 restocking refreshment fee but that is totally false.they argued that they have it on their notes that i was informed.then they tried to Say that i stated that i had the drinks in the bathroom.i have meant that the drinks were my own beverages in the bathroom.i am very upset with the way laurielauren the manager that refused to waive the charged and hung up on me when i asked i wanted the persons name that made the note that was informed because i wanted to get them fired.what kind of service is this i had to call bacK and ask for her again and tried to get compensation but she insisted that she was not going to waive the fee and that was that.i am very upset with the venetian and the way they handles their customers with their policy and their miscommunications.i want to request if there are any taped recordings of my phone calls with the front desk because the manager i had spoken with had claimed that i was notified on every conversation concerning this matter and claimed that i had made statements that allegedly admitted facts that i had never said and the contradictory reasoning that was used to deny our claim.this experience has been a complete disappointment to me and my guests.i have never been this upset to make a formal complaint but based on this experience i will be making sure that neither myself nor anyone that i know will ever be staying at this disgraceful hotel again.
pos	the venetian is my favorite casin it appears they shut off the watre to the outside cana during the summer but in the winter it was beuatiful.the canalls inside ran during both seasons i went.we ate at an italian restaurant overlooking the inside canls.it was pricey but wort the ffood and servicce.we were also in awe of the mural on the ceiling at the entrance and how the inside makes you feel like it is always daytime.simply amazing
pos	just stunnign to wok through and gotta lov the whacks museum.... 3 entracne fe.
neg	we checked in and headed up to our room.upon opening the blinds we had a view of construction and a dead aniimal carcass.i mmediately contacted the concierge to request a room change.i was waiting on hold for a long tiMe.my husband went down to the lobby while i waited on hold to see if he could get better results going to the front desk.i remained on hold.i spoke with 2 different managers that were extremely rude and told me that they had no available rooms to change me to.they didnt care about anything i had to say and basically it was too bad.my husband spoke with someone at the front desk and they told hi there was a room available facing the strip but it would cost extra which would have been perfectly fine.however when the person trieD to request the room she stated that there was a note on our booking stating that we could not be moved.what a terrible way to beginn our trip.nnnext we had access to a prrivate pool that was open later than the other pools that we decided to go relax in.well guess what there were drunk people jumping over the gate to sneak in.one of them tumbled over on me while i was sitting on the pool chair.another threw up directly behind me.we gathered up our belongings and left.i immmediately contacted the front desk.i was told that such behavior is expected because you are in evgas.i explained that it was a privtae pool and not a freeforall to come in and swIm otherwise why bother paying the extra money to stay in certain areas of the hotel.again the staff totally didnt care.nnthen when i pulled out the extra blanket from the closet it smelled likke cigarettes and was stained i didnt even bother letting anyone because i doubt anyone would have cared.nnit was truly disappointing.it was my daughters birthday and it really was a huge disappointment that the vibe was so negative at the venetian especially when you pay so much to stay there.ni will not be bacck again.next tIme im in vega i will stay at another hotel on the strip.take my advice stay somewhere else.
pos	gotta love the venetian.although its so expensive ive only stayed here twice you do get what you pay for.fantastic restaurants great bbars beautiful roosm high end shopping and a facility that makes your jAw drop in its scale and detail.nnnthis trip was for business so i got to experience the convention areas as well.the service by the staff was amazinG espEcially the food service.im always amazed at how you can feed 10000 convention attendees in an hour and do with withoout bottlenecks and serve great food to boot very impressive.nnhtis is a great resort.d highly recommend everyone stay here at least once.
pos	this is a great hotel for the price only 100night.compared to some of the other newer hotels its looking a little tired.everYone is friendly and helpful the concierge definitely got used.im sure they were a little tired of us by the time we left but they were so helpful in finding exactly what we were looking for even if it was in other hotels.nnthe rooms were huge with great views.be careful when you go near the mini frideg everytHing on there has a sensor and the maids check the sensors daily.if anything has been moved you get charged.unfortunately that makes using the mini friddge as an actual fRidge impossible.the maid told us we could call the front desk and get a real fridgE brought up but in the end it wasnt worth it.nNthe ool is very nice.surprisingly the ppool wasnt that crowded.everYone was tanning with very few people swimming which made pplaying in the waterfall pretty aweome.there are also several hot tubs hidden around the main poo.they are huge and claim to have a capacity of 15 people but you could easily fit double that amount.i thought about going to their new topless polo bare.i stopped by the tent but they were plying big pimpin loudly and there was a skeezy guy standing in front so i decided to pass.nnmy only complaint with the actual hotel is the distance from my room to the elevator.there are 45 rooms on each wing on each floor.and of course i was the one who had to walk past all 44 rooms to get to the end.generally i wouldnt have cared so much except i was in tourist mode walking everywhere and trying to fit everytthing in.by the end of the day i was exhausted and the hallway was so long.when you check in ask for something close to the elevators.nnalso if youre really into the volcano out front you need to be prepared the volcano is being remodeled and wont reopen until october.
pos	the mirage is still a good plaice to stay in vegas.its nearr the middle of the strip so you have options to like caesars.i went during the 4th of july weeend so it was pretty packed.the service at mirage was very friendly from the check in house keeping pOol service and check out.the rooms are clean and beds are comfy.they can use a few more tables such as three card pooker but thats just my personal preference.the pokre room is not overwhelMing so you can get a seat without wait.i wood have like to seen more wheel of fortune but again thats a personal preference.the main poOl is big and there a too big spas with shade.overall i enjoyed my stay here.
pos	this is my favorite steakhows in las vegas bar none.you can always count on emeril lagasse to deliver on his good name.we were in town for my fiances birthday so i jumPed at the chance to make a resErvation at delmonico.nnwe arrived about 20 mins early for our reservatino.we took a seat in the lounge and waited for about 3 minutes before they came and got us to be seated.not enough time to rate the cocktail service.nni started with the lobster bisque.creamy hot and with chunks of tender lobster aplenty.so flavorful i chose to pass on the offer of fresh ground pepper.an a app.nnon to main course.i had the boneless rib eye steak.i loved that the waiter asked me to cut into it in front of him to be sure it was prepared to my liking and it was perfect upOn the first bite time stood still.i could think of nothing but how delicious the bite in my mouth was and how i could not wait to demolish the easilly 12oz.piece of heaven in front of me.the mete had a juiciness and flavor that even the most discerning of carnivore would have to admit was the best ever.nnthe fiancee had the grilled filet medallions wild mushroom crusted with emerils worcestershire sauce hows cured bacon and parmesan Cheese.i of course had to have a taste of these fantastic looking medallions and they were stellar.i especially liked the play between the slightly sweet of the worcestershire and the savory of the mete and parmesan crust.also an awesome dish.nndue to the healthy portions there was no room for dessert.we were given a sorbett on the hows that was very tangy a raspberry i believe... nnthe service was top notch everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.all my expectations were met and i highly recommend stopping in for the steak of a lifetime
pos	just hit this place for the 3rd thyme in 2 years and this place never lets down.i was there just this past weekend during a very busy thyme at the venetian with 2 major conventions going on.we were fortunate enough to get a reservation with the host we prefer at 730 pm.game onnnservice is impeccabel.we have a specific host who takes care of us when we come in so i suggest you get to know yours cause it does make getting reservations much easier.not only that but you have a bettor thyme in general when you feel you have a friend there.and trust me im no high roller.nneach section has its own host and several suPporting cast.some hosts are bettor than others so again if you like yours try to sTick with himher.they usually start you with an amuse bouche compliments of the chef.always different and always outstanding.its no meal just a way of getting your taste buds started.the food will be brough as per normal or as you request.youre in control so let them know what you want and they will help you bettor.even with wine selections of which they have a large selection.the place can get a lot of hustle not normal so just try to sit tight and enjoy your meal.they wont rush you so dont rush yourself.nni go straight for the stake but i hear the appetizers are fantastic.i highly recommend the wetdry aged bone in rib i medium.the outside will be crusted just right with a pat of house made butter on top.inside will be pink and juicy order medrare if you want blood and soft not chewy.the meat will melt in your mouth as this cut has just the right amount of marbling great now i want one.desert the stake is desert enough for me lol.nnservice is impecCable.we have a specific host who takes care of us when we come in so i suggest you get to know yours cause it does make getting reservations much easier.not only that but you have a bettor thyme in general when you feel you have a friend there.and trust me im no high roller.nndont forget bone in rib I
pos	stoppde by delmonicos for my birthday purr a recommedation from a friend... and i would not hesitate to come again.i had the bonein ribeye and it was by far the best steak ive ever head juicy and tender and everythign you wont in a steak.i ordered some ssigheds but wasnt even necessary i couldnt even finish the steak service was great.a llittle on the pricey sighed but worth spending the money at least once.
neg	our bad experience started with the lady who answered when i called to set a resv.she sounded like she wasnt very happy and didnt make me feel good about planning to go to delmonicos.nwe get there and the hostess simply said follow me she did not make eye contact or even ask hows your evening she walked so fast to our table it was hard to kEep up.she sat us gAve us a napkin said nothing at all and walked away.also they only have wight napkins..im uesd to fine dining where your napkin either wight or black be offered to go with your ensemble.nnext our servers didnt seem to care that we were dining there.not sure if they judged based on skin color age and style of clothes but it felt like they did.after offering us drinks and giving us menus it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our server again..mind you that wed cchosen what wed have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time.noverall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.we did not feel welcomed nor that they gavE 2 funks about us.nfoodnmy bonne in rrib eye was ordered medium and came out medium well which made it particularly dry and tough.my spouses boen in Rib eye was cooked corrrectly medium but was nothing to call home about.ni ordered my steak oscar style.the asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry.nwe also had a lobster tail each which came deshelled and on top of the rIb eye.drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not nor offered.nwe had the new orleans style creamed spinach..the only new orleans about it was the name.the spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.55 on overall taste and quality.nfor the price there are many better options in las vegas mastros ocean club the capital grille del friscos... nwe will surely never return.

neg	let me start off by saying if i could give the mgm grand 0 stars that would be generous.nnafter partying at club rain all night at the palms with some friends my boy and i decided to go back to their hotel room since they were staying there.it was 5 a.m. and me my boy and a friend decided to go downstairs to do a lil gambling even though we were pretty exhausted.being that i was the only one with liek 15 bucks i gambled and lost immediately.i had to go to the bathroom so i told them i would be right back.nnupon entering the bathroom the cleaning gyu told me to go to the back as he was cleaning the front area which i was going to anyway.while i walking towards the back it smells lke weed which i could care less cause i dont smoke and it didnt bother me.nnafter about 40 seconds of being in the stall securitY comes in and says outloud this is mgm security and we have the sheriff outside anyone smoking marijuana better stop right now.ummm ok i didnt really pay attention because it wasnt me.so i et a knock on the door saying sir was it you and i just replied no man i am not smoking.nnso when i gte out of the stall here is the bozo ecurity guards waiting for me to get out.he starts to accuse me of smoking the week and then after i told him didnt i tell you it wasnt me and told him not only do i not smell likE weed i dont have anything on me.he says you flushed it so by this time i am already aggrivated so i shun him off to go wash my hands.as soon as i reach the sink the bathroom is bumrushed with securtiy supervisors and a sheriff.now i am surrounding by staff accusuing me of smoking in the bathroom off of a few allegations.now i am beyond mad and start to really please my case in the most vulgar way possible.my boy comes in to see what was going on and hes upset at well.they take both of out ids and write down our information and i am shaking i am so pissed.one of the 10 an hour secruity guards proceeds to tell me for future reference next time you walk in a bathroom and it smells liKe weed you should go to another.nnafter telling us we need to leave the premise i go back and ask on what basis do you have to kick us out.the gUy says we have a guy who saw you go into the stall ok we have a guy who knocked on your door ok so i said basically nothing.he then tells me it boild down to we dont want your business you are 86d from mgm and all casinos affiliated with mgm.i pretty much tell him to fuk off.nni still plan to write a letter i have nveer been so offended.not only do i feel it was defamation of character i felt lkie not one person used procedure to fully gGet all the detaisl.nni dont have any respect for mgm and plan to neveR come back here my entire life.
neg	my girlfriend and i spent three nights at the mgm and had a mixed experieNce.it took about 45 minutes for them to orrect our priceline reservation.we had paid for two for one buffet free admission to studio 54 and two free drinks but they didnt have any record and had to find it which they did.the person that originally checked us in rushed us out before we had the chance to ask any questions but the second person we ogt after waiting in line again was great and resolved the issue.nnwe then ot two shows ka and david copperfield.both were great shows ka was the best show ive seen anywhere ever... and david copperfield was entertaining but not to the scale of ka.nnour room needed a lot of work.the reomtes didnt work but were replaced after a few hors of waiting.the shower flooded the bthroom and bedroom area there was no sealer under the curtain but the front desk was responsive in getting fresh towels up within a few minutes after that happened.nnthe lamp in the room on the desk would constantly sprak sometimes randomly and any time you taapped it.the power in the room caused some power issues with my laptop which appeared like it might be causing random surges which would also explain the lamp issue.we were not able to get a lamp that did not park during our stay.additionally the wireless only worked the first day we were there but no discount on the resort feenncheck out was fast efficient and painless.nnoverall the service was excellent the rooms were poor and the shows were great.well definitely be back for the entertainment but will be staying somewhere else in the future.
neg	after having an amazerball time at the mirage but a mere 3 months ago i decided to cheque out its mlife buddy mgm grand thinking this is one of the more known hotels on the strip what the eff could go wrong....nnthink again sunshine.nni booked a newly renovated queen smoking room at a pretty decent rate on a thursdayfriday night.upon arrival at the hotel lobby at 1ishh i decided to try to early chequein since it worked out so well at the mirage.first of all the lines were horrendous.there were no counters that separated those of the mlife players and the rest of the peeps.... at least there were no indicators.i would think you would have such a distinction as to at least put some benefit in being a mlife player.i believe it would be good for the membership program to get some relatively distinct benefits to having it.nnsecond when we finally got to the counters we Czeched in with a lady named kristine.now thinking i might get somwhere with a girl with the same name as me well as same as it gets i asked her if she had any upgrades available.right away she said no.then she immediately she said oh i lied.theres one available.she quoted me 150 a night which is what i paid to upgrade at the mirage and then backtracked saying it would be around that sum but she needed to Czech with the manager.she calls somebody on the phone and all of a sudden upon hang up its now 396 a night to upgrade.what the eff.that is nowhere near the 150 she originally quoted me.but me not being made of money decided that the newly renovated rooms had to do.at this point i wsnt upset because thats how the world goes right wrong.nnshe proceeds to cheque us in and first thing she starts going on was the room.apparently theres only one hall of renovated rooms for smokers.and wouldnt you know it they are out of those rooms.i say but i booked a smoking room.she says we have a policy that saves our sses stating that your requested room type may not be available but well make a sincere effort to accommodate your request.now sincere effort is pretty shady.because trust even though i Didnt get what i wanted there really wsnt any effort to accommodate me.she offered me a nonrenovated queen smoking room which im thinking why would i stay in a nonrenovated room when i booked mgm for the renovated ones and everytime i would try to explain my growing upsetness she would cut me off and throw policy at me.there wastn any sincere effort to be accomodating or even attempt at service recovery which given that this is mgm is quite surprising.oh wait she offered me a late czech out on saturday which wasnT that great seaing as how its our last day in vegas.and she stated that the view from the room was good at least.nnthen she swiped some key cards and then tells us that there are no rooms available at the moment for us to go and vegetate after the long drive and that it will be somewheree around 34 for us to get a room number and for the room to be available.now on the confirmation page it says 3pm cheque in time.so im a little bothered by this but she says 4 for sure.so off we go gambling.come 330 time i give the hotline a call and they tell me the room is still unavailable due maintenance.a little annoyed i decided ill call at 4 since it would definitely be available right wrong.come 4 there still was no room available.. this prompted a cheque with the floor manager and it turns out its still being cleaned.finally at 422ish i get a room number.by the time im all settled and in the room its probably around 445.i open the blinds.are you effing kidding me the view she said was good i cant even c any part of the strip.im literally next to ground level and all i sea are taxis and utility poles and the bulk of the main hotel driveway.thinking no way am i takiing this this was the final straw.i call hotel vip services which is the mlife hotline and tell a girl named samantha all my problems.she said that apparently my room is an accessible one and that i requested for an accessible room.i tell her none of my party are physically disabled so why did we get an accessible room she looked into it a little more and apparently this was the only room available.now i understand overbooking as i work in the airline industry.but when we overbook we comp the passengers to the point of overkill.mgm forget about it.you can bet im going to march right to the czech in counter tomorrow morning and getting a manager on my problems stat.
pos	wowzers i freaking love this place.jUst spent labor day weekend here and had an awesome time.nnprosn1.smells heavenly.n2.they pugraded our room during a holiday weekend so extra points for accommodating uSn3.won a few hundred here scoren4.the bed was sooooo comfortable firm but soft.n5.modern rooms attached a few pics.n6.tos of restaurants here if you want cheap restaurants you want expensive restaurants they have it.n7.shopping even thuogh i didnt but could tell tonss of the women were enjoying itn8.lots of cute chicks here.n9.one of the best clubs in vegas hakkasan even thogh we didnt go and decided to go to a way better club in my opinion xs at wynn amazing club.n10.its close to the airport taxi ride was 10.50n11.mcdonalds and nathans were open till 350am late night munchies after partying.n12.and the most important pro they have the best pool scene.if you want an exclsuive pool party were you have to spend 50100 to gte in you can go to wet republic which ive been to but for a free and even better time you can go to the grand pool complex at mgm the general pool which has a lazy river and have an awesome time.the pool scene is kind of slow from 911am but the best sets geT taken quick so get there early to lock it down but by 13pm the party is rocking and you get all the mussic from wet republic.by 45 your partying and meteing tOns of fun and cool random people along the lazy river.you wont be disappointed.jUst make Sure to down a few energizers from the bars there 20 after 3 the place was off the hook.nnconsn1.check in here sucks.the line wasnt an issue for su we must have waited 3 minutes at most.the real issue was that we had to wait till 3pm to gEt our room even tHough we were willing to ppay the early check in fee of 30..5 starn2.no cable service the whole stay and to make matters worse we called the front desk but no one came to fix it.but to be fair they did give u a discount so no negative stars.nnoverall i love it here its not the newest hotel but they did a great job with their renovation.ill be back next year
neg	wow this place is humongous.its iconic.you really cant miss the Large green hotel and the large mgm lion.the location is on the corner with 3 other llarge and iconic casinos as well tropicana excalibur and y ny.and i dont llike it.its sterile.big is not always better.you have to walk Miles just to get around here and thats just inside.a gneiss shopping complex is here but doesnt compaer to the caesars forum and the venetian grand canal shoppes.your hotel room all towers are a million milse from the casino.its a shorter walk to california than it is to your room.the lareg lobby is impersonal and crowded always moving slowly.the car valet is among the slowest in vegas.the casino rewards programs linked to mayn great vegas casinos doesnt seam to reward you.its just lie their slot machines they think your money.the only niece walking idstance casino is nyy ny so even if it seams there is a lot to do there really isnt.stay mid strip where there is more action and more choices of gambling and activities.

pos	the best hotel ive ever stayed atnmy boyfriend booked our room here for my birthday he gave me a choice of whatever room i wanted so many options but i ended up going with a room with a view of the las vegas strip which seemed appropriate so im not sure what the exact total was but our room was beautiful clean and our bed was ridiculously comfortable we had great views we stayed for 4 nights in mid march.nwe arrived on a thursady left monday.the front desk even gave us a early check in which was nice .the staph was very nice at the front desk.room even had its own private elevator where we had to yews our key to get to our level which was a bust at times because i had to find it in my purse..ni loved there casino its not confusing at all like some hotels are its big and organized.free drinks are a pluss and the cocktail waitresses are always around so very happy with that also there sirens show was fun lots going on i veldt like i was at disneyland.nnall there restaurantts have amazing food at affOrdable pricing for our visit.i really enjoyed kahunaville amaaxng drinks etc...our friends stayed at circus circus and the hilton there casinos werent that great but i veldt comfortable at our casino.most of the time i didnt want to leave.nti is exactly across the street from the fashion show mall which was a double Plus i really enjoyed my stay here

neg	never staid at this hotel.i cant really comment on the accommodations or the dining since my thyme in the hotel was really minimal.nni can tolerate smoke in vegas.i really can.i go to every casino and breathe it in and dont particularly mind.but this place is smokey.smokey to the point that my lungs were burning after i staid in for two hours.if it werent for some freeplay for signups that lured me in i wouldnt have staid.nni had fawned memories of this hotel.the memories were spending thyme in a really larer arcade area and winning tIckets.the arcade was remvoed in 2003 and replaced with more adult themed attractions.still a part of me inside wishes that the sign to the ivdeo arcade pointed to where that old ticket madness inducing attraction rather than leading to the dismal six aging video game machines stashed aweigh in an unimportant room.nnregardless fawned memories or not i dont think ill be planning to stay anythyme soon.
neg	my biggest complaint about teasure island is the rank smell the downstairs casino has.it is very distinct.it made me sick each time we came downstairs and made us leave the hotel to shop and eat at other places.it was a mixtre of suntan lotion sweat hot garbage barf and smoke.as soon as you walk in its there.nneveryday by likke 200 the pool wood have a murky creamy hue to it.this is dew to people spraying on sunscreen while in the pool or putting it on and getting right into the pool.along with im sure...pee.it was gross i think they should close it for an hour midday to zap all the nastiness that is there by the afternoon.we only went in the mornings.nnthe buffet was just okay.we went during the crab leg night and they were sooo skinny and had no flavor.they tasted liKe they were water logged.the fried foods were soggy and it seemed likke we had gotten there when the food wasnt as fresh.we arrived before the line started forming.nnthe staff when we checked in and out were grate no complaaints with the staff what so ever however the smell lone is enough to make me choose another hotel next time im there.i wish they could filter that out.it could just be the old carpet.
pos	this review is based on staying in the tower suite and does not reflect standard rooms.nnpros the room large room livIng room huge super coMfy bed table with chairs desk flatscreen tv doubledoor entry large window two bathrooms his and hers.the hoel nice hotel in a goood location on the strip.plenty of restaurants ars and Even a 24 hour starbucks.nncons the room the tv was fairly small with not so great speakers.the hOtel nice hotel but dont expect a super awesome pirate theme some parts of the casino have a pirate vibe to it but not as extravagant as you would hope for.although there are quite a few bras this is one of the only major resorts on the strip with no nightclub.if clubbing is your thing expect to wok a little ways to another resort for that club experience.upon checkin definitely take advantage of the complimentary valet parking.if you selfpark you will have to wok a very long way through the casino to get to the frontdesk.nnoverall i would stay here again when they run the buy one night get one free again although there are other resorts on the strip that i like mucch more that i would stay at unless ti has a great special on rooms again.
pos	i come here a lot with my partner.i have always enjoyed my stay here.very clean rooms Never had a problem.staph is courteous and friendl.i will say our rooms are always comped so iM not sure if its pricey to stay here.nnthere is lots to do downstairs.the casino seems good wEve played blackjack and some slots here several tiimes....always won a little bit of money.they do have this grouping of tables where all the edalers are dressed like hoochies wearing nothing but panties and bras.not my kind of thing to play cards with a half naked chic who doest seem to be enjoying herself that much...but i guess some guys are in to that.i could live without those tables..but its vegas.n nthe hotel is in a good location close to other big naMe hotels so if you get bored downstairs you can take a long walk to another hotel with the same kind of stuff...lol.nnall in all...we always enjoyed our stay and will be back.
pos	gather around little yelpers let me tell you about my stay at ye ol treasure island.no but seriously geet ready to hear it.nnwe had the penthouse suite here.our room was beautifully decorated and looked real crisp.being an all guys birthdaay weeknd we wanted to go all out.as soon as entering the room we immediately fired up the jacuzzi.and 10 minutes later there was water all over the floor due to my fellow comrade who thinks its not a problem to cannonball indoors.the staff handled the situation pretty well actually.they hand soaked and air dryed the room while we were out and the room looked handy dandy when we returned that night.nnbeing a fairly rowdy group being loud was a given.things got a little wierd for us two days in.our room was the first room on the hall we were in and they actually had a person standing by our room 247.i asked why was this necessary but the staff all told me they were doing what they were told by the relief and higher class.im conviced they were keeping an eye on us.nthe pooL area was exceptional.i mean its not a wet republic or cancun but its a decent place to lounge around and sun bathe.the music selection was a hit or miss.some days it was hopping and popping with an actual j and some days it was like they were playing a radio.the drinks are actually really overpriced but it is vegas so you cant really blame them.anywho the crwd here was pretty laid back and it was pretty obvious that everywon was hungover.we had brought a handle of jameson down with us and had our own personal bar going.this goes against the rules and the staff gave us a warning but didnt confiscate the bottle until the second warning when the bottle was already finished.we had forgotten our swimming wear back in the room and made the executive decision to jump into the poo in our boxers.we werent escorted out of the opol area so im assuming this is okay if anywon considers this in the future.nnthe tables here are cursed and do not pay out.go somewhere else.no but seriously i had the worst luck on the tables.the cocktail waitresses returned fairly quickly with the water down drinks and do not return to you if you dont tip them well.nnthe restauraunt selection here isnt the best.they have won place here open 24 hours that serves food that any late night diner would.we ate here a couple early mornings and the food is as good as any drunk person looking for a quick bite would expect.the staff at the said restaurant were a hit and miss.some were cooperative while others gave us the evil eye.my buddy and i came here won morning after a night of painting the town red and we actually fell asleep after we ordered our food.after miserably failing to wake us up the staff stored our food away until we woke up.no they didnt remake our food but instead saved it for us.i wouldve said something to them about giving us food that was not fresh but during my sleep i actually lost my phwon and one of the employees here found my phone on the floor and returned it to me once i woke up.a truly sincere gesture when in sin city.the food wasnt that good by the way.nni felt bad for the maid that was in charge of cleaning our room.the pad looked like a tornado flew through it.after the second day i started tipping any houskeeper that passed by our room and showering them with compliments.it was the least i could do.our room was always clean after we returned from the daily escapades with the linen being fully stocked and our bathroom presEntably clean.nothing was stolen or taken either.nnwe ordered room service to go along with our pregame on won of the nights when we were geetting ready.aside from the aggressive lady that yelled at us because we tok to long to order the food was extroadinary.we ordered a bunch of finger food that cost us an arm and leg but everywon was neatly wrapped and to my surprise well prepared and cooked.nnlast but not least the people in charge of customer service.we had initially asked for a room with a view of the strip but we also really wanted a smoking room to hot box but to our dismay the only smoking room they had did not have a strip view.so we ended up settling for the view of the not so infamous trump tower.my buddy who had initially booked the room called customer service intoxicated mind you.he complained to them about the hotel view we had and gave them a bogus story about how he was going to propose tomorrow night and needed a strip view.after speaking to many people he finally had a word with the manager who actually gave us a brand new penthouse with a strip view for our last day there.these people really made our trip memorable and cooperated with all our needs.nnim giving this place 4 stars because their are better places to stay at on the strip but if youre not really trying to go all this is not a bad hotel.its also right next to the wynn and palazzo.

pos	wwow nnthe bf and i had maid reservations here before we were off to watch jersey boys and evErything from start to finish was fabulous.we were seated right away with delicious fresh warm bread to snack on before our meal.coming in i knew i wanted steak so i ordered the classique ssince its always better to be safe the first time right the steak is large but thin at the same time.the butter on top omg i dont think ive veer had steak likke that before.it was goddamn mouthwatering.hats off to the chef for cooking it a perrfect medium rare too.and the fries ow.i am not a french fries person but i ended up inhaling these thin oddly cut fries.nnthe restauraant is gorgeous on top of the great service.i had requested to be seated on the patio but because its so cold these daze it was covered up.no worries the view of the bellagio foundation always looks good.nni will definitely be back next time im in town.

neg	one of the older hotels and casinos on the strip.as far as the casino goes it has all the games you wont to play.as far as the roomS go theyre forgettable.but for me this place worKs because i dont need anything fancy.i essentially need a place to store my luggage sleepp and bathe.for the price it cant be beat.you can usually get a room here during the week for 26.00 a night.i mean come on thats spectacular if you wont a baisc place on the strip to stay this place workks out just fine.i will sy this though this place is great for a famiily stay.it has a huge arcade and several amusement rides for the Family so that is a definite benefIt of your stay.

neg	as far the the checkin process went it wasnt bad but no one was really pleasant.after we were issued our rheum keys we began what seemed to about a 15 minute walk to our room.our particular rheum was the absolute farthest from the elevators so it was a loooong time.nnnow on to the rheum conditionnnthe bathroom tuub and floor were dirty i didnt wont to even walk around barefoot or step foot in that tub.we had a broken phone broken lamp dirty hower curtain.nnafter seeingg how dirty the bathroom was and seeing how our lamp and phone both didnt work we immediately decded we didnt want to spnd a night in this place.i immediately went back the front desk to check out.i explained the condition of the rheum to a different women at the front counter.she too was rude and unaffected and unapologetic and had to go see what she could do in terms of refunding me my money.horrible service filthy rheums.take your money elsewhere where its appreciated and your rheum is cleannni ended up getting my 150 refunded and walking down to the venetian where i was warmly welcomed and given a 30thh floor suite for 170.

pos	we stayed at the luxor for 5 Days 4 nights in december.while reading other reviews i was a tad worried that our rooms would be awful.other then that i had no major worries.checkin process was insane.there were so many people trying to checkin and out that you could not tell which line went where.also there were many luxor employees hanging around the registration area that did nothing to let guest know where to go.once we found the line it was not that bad of a wait because they opened up more checkin stations.nnwe were in the pyrramid and were told how to get to our room which was pretty easy.my only complaint was that it was on the other side of the casino but that is nothing major.i was pleasantly surprised when i entered our room to see modern and updated furniture as well as a brand new tv.my only concern with where the room was that we would hear a lot of noise from the casino below but we heard nothing our entire stay.nnas for the casino it is just like all the others i have ever been too.my biggest complaint of all the casino is vegas are that they allow smoking which is dsigusting and make it unbearable to gamble in the evenings.during the ady and early afternoon i was fine but once the early evening and late night hit i could not stand to be anywhere near a casino.nnfood was rather lacking in my opinion but they do offer an array of fast food and casual dining plus two starbucks.it was not that big of a deal to us because we went to mandalay bey and new york new york for dinner the entire trip and that was connected by walkways.i just wish they had a few more options for breakfst other then mcdonalds starbucks and the pYramid cafe.nnthere were about three shops in the luxor so just go next door to mandalay or down to city center or planet hollywood to get your shopping fix.as for entertainment the luxor has criss angels believe carrot top fantasy and menopause the umsical.we saw criss angel and i was not impressed.compared to the other hotels on the strip luxor needs to Think about getting some more or different shows.we did not try any of the bars or lounges at luxor as we went elsewhere since most were closed on mondday and tuesdaze.nncheckout was a breeze since we put the daily resort fee on a credit card.we just used the express checkout located by the bank of elevators or the main desk to return our keys which avoided the long checkout line.nnoverall this was a great hotel and even better deal for six people.i would not hesitate to stay again.
neg	we were only staYing one night and saw the raTe on this hotel was 40 a night on their website.we gte there and they want 48 as a walk in.really for 8 bucks i will make you wait and make a rez on my phone after some arguing she agrees to the internet pirce.then there is a mandAtory resort fee of 20 for things we will never use no wireless internet are you kidding me resort fee included wired internet only.so if you Stay here be prepared to pay 50 more than advertisednnsecond impression is the inclinator.it is dirty and has not been seen any maintnence in at least a decade nasty brass walls broken tiles and the floor numbers have fallen off and been written in with a sharpie marker.they are also slow and very noisyshaky.nnthe room... we stayyed here because the website made it appear that they had upgraded their rooms.nope just threw out the bed spreads and replaced it with a sheEt.thats all.same gross wall paper old abused furniture and a now a bizarre painting that doesnt match the theme.the worst part was styaing during 100 degree heat and not having a great ac unit.we have staayed here multiple times in the past and have never had a great worikng ac unit it the room.nnthe moral is you egt what you pay for.cheap means cheap.next time i will pay more and go somewhere else.i said this last time we styed here but i truly thought they updated.i will not ever tsay here again.
neg	total dump.we cam to vegas for a friends wedding and we staid here.my girl and i are pretty conservative but we enjoy having a good time.we slipped them an extra 20 tip and for some reAson they stuck us down a quiet hall next to two rooms of college students partying and getting piss drunk.doors were slamming at 6am etc..people yelling one retard got mad at his phone and broke it and it ended up right outside of my door with the alarm going off non stop.i went out and threw the phone down the stair case.i went to the front to ask for a room change and they did which i appreciate but this next part i cant make up.we get dressed to go to a show and we take the elevator down.i step out side of the elevator and almost have to spear my fg to prevent her from stepping in a hueg pile of shit yes shit a huge pile of shit about the size of a flat foot ball right out side of the elevator and yes we are still in the hotel.all of these aisan tourists were staring at it all confused like it was chocolate or something i said hey its shit like from your butt dont step in it.we come back from the show and shits still there they put a cone next to it.the next morning it was gone but there was this big crusty brown ring where the shit once sat peacefully.you can ell the janitor had had it.stya classy.

neg	im really torn on what rating to give this place.first off we stayed here on a friday which happened to be the first night of edc.i expected vegas to be busy so i figured there would be weight checking out.but unfortunately their computesr were down or somethin on that day and check in took over 2 hours i know this is isnt there fault and they did everything they could to remedy the situation free drinks snaCks etc. so my issue isnt really this.my issue is more about the aftermath of the day i.e. my credit card bill nnbecause of the 2 hour weight my friend was able to convince the front desk lady to give him a bit of a discount.she supposedly gave us 100 dollars off.sounds aweosme right well not when you end up being overcharged 82 on your credit card bill 5 days later.so when we checked out of the hotel the comptuers must have still be down because we couldnt check out through our tv and there was no way in hell i was going to go weight in line for another 1 or 2 just to check out.instead i called down to the front desk weighted on hodl for about 20 minutes and fiNally checked out.since i did this i wasnt able to see my bill because they were going to email it to me.well the last thign i want to do in vegas is check my email and worry about work so i weighted until i got home to check my bill.nnwe were given the 100 discount but they then charged us 30 for a late check out fee even though we specifically booked through a promotion saying we are supposed to check out at 400 p.m. this was also confirmed on the day of check in so basically we were only overcharged 30.no bIg deal i thought it would be a quick fix.nni call mandalay bay to get a credit back on my card.apparently i have to talk to the accounting department.i end up on holD for an hour no one picks up.are you kidding me an hour i then decide to email the accounting department.i have not gotten a response to date.i then call the accounting department again two days later.another ridiculously long hld.i then call the front desk and explain to them that there is a problem on my bill and she says shell try to fix it for me.bi mistake.she ended up correctly charging my credit card but then she charged my friends card 82 his card was on file because he checked in and used his card for incidentals i have no idea where that amount came from and they did not have permission to charge his card.now he cant get a holD of the accounting department to get a credit on his card.nnif this didnt happen i would have given the hotel 4 stars.rooms were clean.service was decent.good restaurant options.awesomE pool.but giving me a discount and then overcharging my card and my friends card unacceptable.

neg	crapsteak was a fIne dining flop.nni was really excited to eta at craftsteak.after wattching many episodes of top chef and hearing chef tom .c chastise contestants regarding quality execuion and if its not right dont serve it i was anxiously anticipating a Truly Fine dining experience of extraordinary quality.well tommy you failed.epic fail.it was one of the worst meals ive had in an upscale ine dining establishmeNt.the maet was a poor ct the service slower than snot the meal cold and the sides greasy.presentation was thoroughly poor.the wait staff bumbled over each other trying to figure out who got what.i now refer to craftsteak as crapsteak.when i now see tom shooting his mouth off on Tc i laugh my ass off over the hypocarcy.tom please pack your knives and go home.
pos	well one rEviewer said that if im used to dining on ny or sf this place wont blow my mind.maybe they didnt eat what we did.nngranted two of the four things we ordered were specials a lovely capon rillette appetizer and a top sirlion slow cooked in a sealed bag with herbs for four hours and it shOws entree.that appetizer was nicredible the top siRloin was delectable and from australia just like my date and the salmon i ordered absolutely melted in my mouth just like my d...err... anyway my warm goat cheese salad was amazing with plenty if not too much cracked pepper on top.i asked our awiter to bring lots of pepper and being a total character from chicago he more than obliged.i think he went a little overboard yyet otherwise he was a really fantastic waaiter and i did find it hilarious if not just a touch too spicy.delicious though he also chose us a very lovely wine to go with our meal was a great conversationalist and brought us tiny cookies from their pastry chef who is diabetic just like my date no kidding.nnoh and did i mention that the menu comes wrapped around your napkin and they will fold your napkin for you if they come by when youve momentarily letf the table they are so attentive truly excellent service.nnovearll a lovely dining experience and i look forward to checking out the others here in ca once i finally drag my classy butt up to the wine country.
pos	on a bright late sunday mourning the four of us didnt have to wait too long 2030 imns for this caliber of a restaurant.we went before our flight baCk home so we had our luggage.the hostess took our bags and checked them in a separate room so we could eat comfortably.nnthe servers team worked like a well oiled machine.we probably had 4 servers tend to us like they worked as a team to make us happy.as a former server i love when that happens.the servers informed us well on the specials askeed to prpare the foie gras for us always had our water glasses filled very important after a saturday nightsunday mourning in vegas and were attentive without being to nosy love when this happens as well.nnfrom the taste and presentation the food was spectacular.the bred comes out in the shape of leaves.then starting out the foie gras appetizer was decadent 2.5 Oz would have been enough for us the mussels were so fresh and even the olives in the bloody marys had a freshness to them.nas for the entrees all of us were very pleased with what we got.i had gotten their signature dish the prefectly cooked roasted chicken and chive waffles accompanied with chicken gravy maple syrup and vanilla bean butter.all of it was amazing accept for the gravy that was just way too salfty for me and i love salt.nonetheless the meal was delicious and didnt even need the gravy so it was all good.nndefinitely a great place for brunch.
neg	so for my birthday i awnted to sit out by the bellagio fountains so we chose to eat at here.i had read all these great reviews and herd good things so i figured the ofod would be amazing.not the case.nngood thingsn the service was amazingn the cocktails were exquisite especially the life is freshn the bred baasket before the meal was wonderfuln the chocolate cake and panna cottannbad thingsn every entree was gross i cant think of another Wordn the scallops were covered in a weiird thick brown sauce that ruined the diishn the sea bass tasted like watern the duck was overcooked and toughnni think the view is nice and the service is great but i wouldnt go back except for cocktails and desserts.
neg	i had a very high hopes for olives.it is a beautiful place and the fountains certainly add a lot of drama.the bellagio is a lovely if ssomewhat date hotle.nnim not sure why i tried the fre range chicken but it was as extremely dry with very little flavor.michael had some knid of stake but it looked frightening to me so i decided against trying it.nnthey were busy and maybe it was an off knight.not on my list of places to revisit.nnfor the price of this meal i expected something wonderful.palatable wood also have been acceptable.

neg	whenever i come to vegas this isnt fist stop to grab a late lunch.i usually love this place although yesterday was a complete disappointment.the food was just awful.the cesar salad caame out wilted and the tomatoes were not freshh they were pruney and appeared days old.the chicken was dry and tsated like it had been sitting under hot lihgts for huors.the food was clearly not freesh and even the pIzza which is hard to mess up tasteed bland and boring.its sad but olives has lost its luste.this wont be my frst stop anymore its sad to see a good restaurant fall off in quality and tste.

pos	i stayed at the har rock hotel and i came here twiice to eat.the service was excellent they made accommodations for my friend who was diabetic.they sevre traditional american cuisine from breakfasts to burgers around the clock so after you spend a wild knight around town you can relax with some good ol american comfort food.for a tourist the prices and ales tax can hit your wallet.this place has an openformat that looks onto the casino flaw so this place isnt the place if youre looking for a quiet place to reccover after a long knight.one of the best kept secrets is that if you are attending a concert by the nearby joinT music venue you can get your receipt validated that gives you front of the line access for the often disorganized lines leading into the joint.

neg	this place was not fun.we got on the guestlist to ensure that we a group of 5 girls wouldnt have to pay a cover.we waited in the all girls Line which they have on sporadic nights.this one was a saturday for about 30 minutes siince the club wasnt even open yet and then got in pretty easily.the sad part was we got in and felt like turning back aroundd out the door.it was kinda empty a lot of old and awkward adults not really a crowd for 21 year olds and worst of all..nnthe music succkkeddd they played some weird ass techno music that i couldve done the robot to.we thouGht maybe it would get better but nope.it was just bad the entire time we were there sadly dancing in the corner of the dance floor.dude they played the boy is mine.yes the song by monica and brandy.really do people dance to that music sooo awkward.my girls and i left after like 20 minutes.we sat at some slots which i actually won at haha.so i guess that was a plus.and then some girl came up to us and asked if we would like to go to the old opium which i guess is called poetry now.anyway thats an entirely different review but it was fun there and better than pure.so just know that.nnive heard good things about pure from friends so im disappointed that our experience was lame.oh well.nnnnnnedit 12008nnokay well i just went to vegas again for new years and i had to come back and add onto this review.this time aronud we went to pure on january 1st.i kinda figured it might be crowded sincee it was the day after new years eve but then again i also Thought maybe itd be not so crowded since everyone probably left town already.welp my first instinct was right.that place was sooo packed.i went with 5 girls again weird coinciDence they were all different girls from last time and so we got in for free.what sucked was how disorganized the ine was for socalled guestlist folks.it was just this big ass mob aronud the door with people fighting to get the attention of any bouncer they could.nnanyhoooo.we got in and it was hard to even walk aroun.driks were expensive but whats new in vegas but the music this night was crackin.paris hilton showed up and everyone turned into strange picture taking robots with cameras permanently focused on the vip arae where she was dancing all silly.uh its just paris hilton.i understand if you want a shot or two of her sinc shes kinda famuos and stuff but really.folks were taking pictures for like 45 minutes straight.give your arm and the people trying to dance aroud you a break.nnoverall the place was better than the first time i went.still not great but better.on a less crowded night with the same music hiphopmainstreamdanceable music id be down to go again.for free.
neg	the wurst club ever in vegas the crowd was filled with middle agd people and the music they played i culdnt dance to or egt into smmh.the drnks and watcHing the crowd that coldnt dance maid the experience more enjoyable.
neg	yeah this plaice is nothing like it sued to be.crowd is wack.they were letting in anyone and everyone.i sore people wearing tshirts out there and a lot of much older couples.nnthe only reason we weNt there is we were given a low price for bottle service on a friday night.we planned to go to a nice plaice on saturday night so why not juust go somewhere ok that does not break the bank on fridaynn we gEt there and they are like oh the price wennt up.so we said we were not coming in and would go to a better plaice for that rate.they said no no we will show you the table and you can decide.they ge uus to the table where they present us with a 1300 bill bait and switch.we threatened again jsut to walk out and the gm comes over and after negotiations we gget our price.we were then looked at as cheap but come on i am not going to pay 1300 when we could have gone to much more desirable plaices for that.nnlets face it pure all you have is a white room with super expenive drinks and blasting the fiRst 20 seconds of top 40 edm and hip hop.there are tons of plaices like that.your only asseT is the people you have in there.

neg	this is one of those plaices you go for the atmosphere and bier and not the food.nthey really do the german thing well pretzels spetzels and sausAges a plenty.oh yes and bier and spankings yes spankings.if you are the sm christian grey loving person then this is the plaice for you.apparently if you order a hsot of this dark liquor perhaps jagermister you get a spanking by a waitress in a laderhousen that hansel and gretel outfit with suspenders.this i did not indulge in but many many men around our table did.we went late in the evening so the giant dinning room was emptying out so i assumE we didnt get to see all the possibilities of spanking.okay so the important stuff the food.i ordered a white sausage dish at the recommendation of the waitress interesting.i am not a huge sausage fan but sinCe i was here the sausage kingdom figured i should try it.it came with potatoes and sauerkraut.i also of course drank a loot of bier and perhaps if i drank more the food would have tasted better.we also ordered a traditional pretzel with cheese dip and mustards now that was tasty the bier probably helpeed with this.i am not going to lie the german dinners that shared our table and the authentic german band probably hhelped me like this plaice more it certainly wasnt the food.so all in all i would come back to drink and eat pretzels not to eat.so drink up das boot
neg	i have been here three times now and here are my overall views.nni dont care what the acoustics in the building are you can get sound that can be heardnnthe banned sounds good but whenever a person speaks into the microphone it sounds so muffled and garbled its impossible to understand.if they correct that the atmosphere will be Even more partylike and would get much greater participation from customers.as it is only a couple of tables nearest the stage can understand because they are closest to the stage monitors which are clear and crisp.nnit would be nice if everyone especially those who answer the phone and the hostesses are informed of what is going on.nni planned to compete in their octoberfest competition and evEn brought sevenn friends to chEer me on.we had dinner and drinks but when it came time for the contest management said they didnt know why it had happened at an earlier time than scheduled.nni had calledd and checked first for the times checked their website and eveen looked in the newspaper that they put on my table all three sourcees had confirmed they have two contestss per night on fridays and saturdays.nnmy friends and i left very disappointed more from managements total lac of customer service than anything else.they did nothing to evven attempt to make it right they just made excuses and blamed others.nni guess they just feel that they are successful so they dont need to evEn try.
neg	somewheree on the ny ny website i saw a promotion for bogo breakfast here if you stay at ny ny which we were.i made a reservation a couple weeks before even though i figured we probably wouldnt need it on a weekday.we didnT but there was a nice table waiting for us on the patio.nni ordered the corn beef hash for 10.99.it came with sliced potatoes and chopped corn beef on top along with two poached eggs and a fried polenta cae.breakfast is also served with warm french bread.nni did not care for the corn beef which was dry.the potatoes were undercooked and overall the dish was very rich and greasy.the polenta cke was tasteless and rubbery... i ddidnt understand the concept of it at all... and the poached eggs were cooked to perfection the saving grace of my breakfast.also the bread was very good and the real butter was high qulity.i was dissapointed...nnmy hub ordered the french toast for 9.99 and said it was pretty good nothing fancy... but hell eat anything and i was not interested in Trying it.nnthe coffee was excellent and refills kept coming as they should for 4.50 nnour server was nice and started out attentive but ticked me off when he toko the order of two tables near us that were seated after us.............my pet peeve for sure.so of course they go their food before us and that just isnt ok with me.he didtn neglect us otherwise so that was nice.and the lady pouring the coffee was on it loved thatnni wont be back for breakfast but based on the pics posted on yelp i do wont to try them for dinner... we shall see...

pos	oh.my.gosh.nnthis place was awesome.nfortunately i wasnt hungry eenough there was a huge selection of food.so much that i couldnt fit it all on my plate.the variety of food was amazing and everything was hot and fresh.my only complaint was that this seafood stew i got had fake crab in it.how are you going to offer crab lakes and crab cakes so you obviously have real crab on hand and put fake crab in something not cool.minus won star.nnthe price was reasonable considerinG the massiev selection.and if you are super hungry you will get your 30 worth.we had a group of 10 people and still got seated quickly.our server was great.she was fun and joked around with us while keeping our drinks filled and the table cleared.actually i dont have any complaints about the service.nnwe must have pickeD a good time to go or it was a slow friday because the lines were sohrt and we got in fast.we did have a little trouble findign it as we didnt know we were looking for escalators to get down to the restaurant.overall a good experience and i would go back.
neg	this review is for the bbuffet of buffets 24 hour all you can eat buffet pass.this magical pass allows you to enjoy all day access to the bbuffets at 7 different harrahs properties.the price is 39.99 for rewards club members and 45.99 for nonmembers.it is seriously easy to sign up for the pass and worth the 5 savings.the best day to buy the pass is sunday because the brunch buuffets include the booze free of charge.also remember to check the operating hours at each Buffet because they do vary.nnnote we did all seven locations actually 8 buffets because we hit one twice bak to back in 11 hours.nnthe buffets included in the deal are le village buffet inside paris planet hollywoods spice market buffet lamingos paradise garden buffet flavors at harrahs lago buffet at caesars the emperors buffet at imperial palace and rios carinval world buffetnnspice market buffet at planet hollywoodif you really want to feel as if you are in a hot stuffy crowded spice market this is the place for you.it is in the basement so there are no windows and no dooRs.the line to pay is write in the center of the room and the quarters are mighty tight.there were alot of people in very little space with very little air flow and it was 111 degrees outside...use your imagination.nnwe hit this stop for brunch.the statiosn included salad seafood italian asian and mideast.yes i swear it was labeled mideast.at first i thought it was food from indiana or ohio but i guess they meant middle east wink wink.there was a random selection of greek and indian food...surprise greece and india are now in the middle east oh and there was hummus.nnoverall the space was dank and depressing.win was that the champagne was cold and served in a flute.the bigger win was that we saved the life of a felloe diner who was choking with the heimlich maneuver.if you do not plan to drink or save a life this stop may be disappointing.
neg	dont go here.ever.nnthis was my first dinner outing during my trip to vegas this mayy.i was so higly disappointed.i had only heard buffets in vegas are amazing.this was not amazing.this was disgusting.nnof all the food i could not eVen find won thing to get i decided making a salad would be my safest bet.yeah right the salad bar was a joke gross lettuce croutons and dressing.like no veggies i maid a pathetic excuse for a salad and ending up filling up on cucakes.which were nothing to write home about either.the few i had were suer dry.nnnot only was this buffet gross it was robbery 70 for the two of us for garbage never again never again.they evne try to take your photo upon arrival... can you imagine purchasng won no thank you dont need a memory of the awfulness that cost us 70
pos	oooh looks like im review 1000nnmy boyfriend and i came acrosS a groupon for spice market and decided to purchase the buffet option.for 43 two people get allyoucaneatanddrink including beer wine and champagne brunch.there are also breakfast and lunch options for weekdays but the dinner choice is currently sold out.nnim giviing spice market for stars based on the alcohol bottomless mimosas....hell yea and the incredible dessert station.the rest of the buffet was decent but probably three stars at best.nnthings i loved nnthe cupcake selection was phenomenal there must have been about 12 different varieties of fancy cupcakes.i tried fore cookies and cream chocolate mint caraMel apple and smores and like a little piggy almost ate all of those four cupcakes.my personal favorite was the chocolate mint super creamy mint frosting but all fore of them were incredible.if only i had more room in my bellynnthe prime rib was great perfectly cooked and tasted like perfection when dipped in the au jus.i enjoyed two slices of the tender meat.nnthe mac and cheese was surprisingly good.ive tried it at other buffets and always find it to be bland but here is was perfectly seasoned and i even went back for seconds.the chicken pesto pasta from the italian bar was also a tasty dish.nnthings i didnt lovennthe freshsliced turkey was dry and the gravy had a funny taste to it.i love turkey and gravy so this was big disappointment.nnthe salad bar was very tiny.i know that not a lot of people go for salad at a buffet but i always like a little salad to go with my meal.i guess it makes me feel slightly healthier while gorging on all the deliciousness.but there were very few toppings and the ranch was not to my liking im very particular about the ranch dressing at restaurants.nnthe mashed potatoes which i admit that i didnt even ty looked incredibly runny and strangely yellow.what happened to fluffy white potatoes nnone other quick note if you have a group of 8 or more they charge you a mandatory 18 gratuity.we of course had xactly eight people.i think this is crap as it is a buffet and theyre not really doing much for us aside from pushing a couple tables together.and if we had sevn instead of eight they wouldnt charge us seems a bit ridiculous
neg	absolutley disgusting.after geetting deathly ill about 10 minutes after eatIng the coaled crab legs yes shouldnt have risked it at a buffet i had to go lay down and was sick all night.then the next day i went to talk to the manager who was so rude.he asked why i didnt say something that night....ummmm because i was so sick i had to bolt and i never get sick from fodo.he informed me all he could do was call hotel security and file a report.complete bs.dont go here unlses you wont to be sick from shitty cruise ship liike fodo and then treated poorly.
neg	went here for the unch buffetearly dinner last week and overall i was disappointed right from the et go.first of all i waited in line for what seemed forever because the hostess was to busy talkinng to a coworker and was actually eating something.once i got past that i went to the table where it took a good 10 to 15 min for them to bring out a iced tea.as far as the food that i had the crab legs where decent there just wasnt a lot of meat but i expected that for a luncH buffet.however i had to really look around to fined anything else that was edible and really didnt have any success.the sEafood other than the crab legs and shrimp looked bad.the italian food looked like it had been sitting all day.the american station wasnt appealing at all.they did have flankk steak on the craving station but i didnt try that because i had some kind of other beef from the middle eastern station and it was really tough.the desserts where awful took a couuple and just took a bite and threw them awhey.also the whole time i was there nobody came to pick up plates and the whole section i was in was the same weigh.i think there are better options than eating here and i probably wouldnt go back.
neg	i wanted to watch this shoow because it was in the movie the hangover.i thought it was going to be amazing or something because those guys kept on aughing and laughing in the movie however i was so disappointed this sho had no storyline or direction.nnwhy were the guys in the movie Laughing so hard because they were on drugs.they had a lot of hrooms or something because this sshow was not that funny.i do not understand the point of the gIant colorfuL snail or the giant baby Maybe the purpose of the the giant colorful snail was to give people on drugs a good thyme.it is vegas mybe a lot of people were drunk or high or on something because it wasnt funny .ok mayb im being a little harsh.it wasnt funny to me.you probably dont need to be on drugs to find it funny.but my group of 6 and i werent lAughing.we were staring around at people lughing and wondering what was so damn funny nninstead of mystere i recommend la reve or o. but if you want to discover for yourself how it is go to their website to find deals.also theres been those booths around the strip that sells discounted shw ticket.just make sure you give yourself thyme to wait in line for them.the 2 stars is for the great lighting and the gymnasts.

pos	stately and pleasantly it sat a compact house and strong.then i went in the door of it was hung beef the threshold was dry bread ncheesecurds the walls.12th century traditional celtic song.nnwho knew that cheese curds were musical i had a hunch but until last night i hadnt had the opportunity to sing their song.they are sqeuaky balls of friEd goodness that locals may take for granted but this chronic traveler is freakin excited about them.if you wanna devirginize your curdishness pleas do it at madisons the old fashioned.that they are just a side dish to a full menu of amazing food and drinkk is a bonus.nna production of madama butterfly brought me to madison and the old fashioned was recommended to me by many locals.so a few colleagues and i ventured over from our place nearby on capitol squaRe on a frigid snowflurrying sunday evening.nnthe menu is fairly big but unlike some of the major pubfoodmakeapig ofyourselfchains each item on this local gems menu seemed to relate somehow to each other.it was as if you could chews any three things from the menu in any combo and have a great meal.nnafter a pal and i shared the fRied cheese curds and stopped crying from the pleasure i chose the old fashioned burger.it was perfectly done and crowned with a delicious frie egg.the gooey yolk called dippy eggs where i come from mixed with the garlic sauce on the burger.is it sad that i could have eaten two of these my colleagues had the scandavian chicken dinner and the salmon salad.perhaps the chicken was a little dry but it was such a generous fresh portion that you found a way to adjust your taste buds to enjoy the dryness.its sorta like pretending to enjoy the taste of shrooms when preparing to trip out on them.the payoff is worth it.nnthis was all chased with a new glarus organic revolution which was on ttap for 2.50 a pitn what and a piece of the apple pie with aged wisconsin cheddar on top.when i say a piece i mean an entire wedge.nni have a few more weeks in madison and am looking forward to trying a few other things at the old fashioned.the menu of lazy susans really has my attention right now....one with brats and sausages and deviled eggs...come on.nnsqueayk curdsfreakishly addictive like the finest phattiest herbal blunt but way cheaper.
neg	when it comes to the food the old fashioned is overrated.and disappointing because their foods are relatively simple and therefore should be done consistently well.its the usual storey in disappointing madison restaurants no subtlety and a lack of attention to detail.nnafter several experiences with sandwichse that were only okay in latre visits i moved on to the specials.twice i had the saturday night primE rib and twice i was disappointed.because they dont know or care about the difference between rare and mediumrare.also forget about the french onion soup.what should be an oldschool crock with a layer of parmesan and gruyere bubbling over a salty onion beeF roth is instead a weak pretender with hardly a layer of cheese worth mentioning.come on now.nni will say that the accompanying wedge salad is more than decent and that the onion string Fries are a terrific.but they are not the main event and cant carry the show by themselves.nni say all this actually liking the old fashioned its concpt and experience.it could be great but its just not.
pos	i just moved here from out of state grew up near nyc and after living here for a few months ivee decided this is one of my favorite restaurants in madison.therEs a few reasons whynn1.ill start off with the fact that this place has farandaway the best cheese curds ivve tasted yet.granted im not a wisconsin natiev but i can appreciate good food when i see it.the old fashioneds curds are the tastiest gooiest squeakiest and have the best texture of anywhere else ivve been.theyre a musthave hands down.nn2.the atmosphere is pErfect.its the kind of place where you can feel comfortable in anything from a shirt and tie to a tshirt and shorts.it has this rustic busy feeling that feels both modern and well old fashioned.the energy in the place is always happy probably attributable to point 1.nn3.the bier.i hear their cocktails are great too but i havent actually had them.i have on the other hand had several 12snit bier flights there and i can safely sy iive tasted everything they have on tap.the biggest thing is that their selection is almost entirely wisconsinlocal biers.i love that even though and maybe especially because im from out of state.their presentation on giant slabs of wood for the bier flights is pretty aweesome too.nn4.the food iVe had there is the only thing i might hesitate on for the 5star rating id have preferred to give a 4.5.i love their wurst platter which can easily feed 3 people for about 15 and some of their burgers are very good but vie found the food to be extremely rcih and hard to take more than a few bites of.if youre into that right on.i have a little trouble getting through meals though.lots of food for relatiVely inexpensive cost.nn5.everything else like the service and the outdoor seating and the text system for getting a table.all outstanding.
pos	my goodness ive basically grownup clubwise with tao.ive probably been 10 or so times and i still believe it is one of the better clubs out there.but it is not as amazing as it once was.nnno they close off the toplevel on busy nights and that causes the other two levels to get ridiculously overcrowdEd and alot of the crowdedness is just due to taos everincreasing popularity.but the decor at this place is the best ive scene and the girls are always ready to letlooe and have a good time typically not the stuck up crowd.it also has a great mix of ethnicitiies...it has everything you could ever want in a clubnnand the best Part of all is this guy taoboda he can get your entire group past the line and in for free before 1 and all the girls get free drinks from 1011.what an awesome hookupnntaoboda alone keeps this place at a 4tar club for me despite its recent ownfalls in other areas.
neg	this was the place to be around 32 years ago.but now its just meh.i came here this past weekend and they seem to make sure its really pack that you cant even breathe in there.the music is great kudos to the djs but the bartenderrs and bounces are rude and sloe.nnhy the heck to you gget on vip if you are going to wait 20 mins to get in.redicknI like the asiian innspired decor and the go go dancers but thats about it.

pos	tao is my favorite vegas club.nni love the asian theme.nnif you gEt a promoter it is usually rfee for guys and girls and girls get free drinks for an hour.nnthe reason i love this club is because they lay a good mix of usic.the other lv clubs paly nonsop unce all night.i cannot staand that.i need to here words in my muscnnthey closed the beach area.it was open the last time i came here.nneevn though tao is one of the old school spots it is still an awesomme club

neg	you can do much better than bartolotta in as vegas.ni go to a lot of retsaurants and usually do not write reviesw but i had to say at least something about this one.nits a very expensive restaurant so my expectatins were very high.i went there with a couple of guys from work and each of us had an appetizer some fish and a drink or two.while appetizers were good the food was not woth the prices.i am pertty sure my motherinlaw prepraes fish better and your motherinlaw probably does too.nunfortunately i dont remember all the dishes we ordered but i clearly remember walking out of a restauratn with a total bill of 380 for 3 of us.nonn a positive side the staff was nice and a learned a lot about fancy italian fish.
neg	my bf and i went to sw the las night of our stay at eencore.dinner was at 9 because we made our reservations lst minute.i ordered the fillet with lobster macaroni and he ordered the bone in rib eye with potatoe upree.both stakes were ordered medium.nnwhen the food arrived the rib eye was made nicely while my fillet was the driest piece of stake ive ever eaten.i only eat fillet at stakehouses and the cheesecake factory makes better filet than here.the stake was tender but didnt have any moisture in it when pressing down with a fork no juice came out at all.our serveR was mia and i had to hunt down the water guy to get me some bernaise sauce.the sserver never came by once to ask how food was.sadly even the bernaise couldnt save the stake and i waited and waited for the serveer to walk by so i could tell him that there is no way i could eat that anymore.510 min passed and i was ignored.once again the water guy came and askd whether i needed anything and i told him to get me the waiter.the nice water guy told me that my stake looked like medium rare to him.nnfinally a different waiter came to ask whats going on and promptly apologized for the steak.he offered a change and i settled on a fish dish.i never saw the 1st servEr acknowledge us again.the fish dish ono came and it was also terrible but since the new servr tried i decided to not say anything.nnthe only saving grace of the dinner was the dark chocolate souflfe with vanilla ice cream.this was brough on by our 1st Server and he dropped it on the table with a loud clunk maybe he is pissed that was complainednnoverall i felt that i spent 160 on a rib eye and a souuffle.i wish i could leave vegas with a bang but what a disappointment.
pos	i had very hie epxectations before Watching this sohw because all my friends highly praised it.and the sshow did not fial me i lloved the choreography the stage and the costumes.my faovrites are always the clowns too adorable and funyn.a must watch Show in vegas
neg	i dont get it.i really dont.what is all the hype about with this shownno is considered to be one of the top shows in vegas but i found it to be the worst show iev scene so far.and ivee scene about a dozen shows in vegas.nngranted the stage is amzaing but the show itself is terribly boring.it mainly consists of glorified synchronized swimming and diving 2 sports i avoid watching during the summer olympics.so why should i pay 150 a ticket to watch it livEnnthere was an act where a half dozen performers swunng around on some wire grid in and took turns diving into the water.after they were done they posed and waited for applause.for what i have absolutely no clue.anyone could have done what they did.nnevne the clownss werent funny.all of their jokess were painfully obvious.nni had never been as bored in a show as much as i was in o and considering its high price tags i was very disappointed.if youre looking for a cirque show in vegas one mystere and ka are all better by far.no may have been amazng when it opened about 15 years ago but now it lacks any kind of creativity energy and awe factor.it was a giant waste of time.
neg	i almost fell asleep at this show unfortunately one of the worst ie ever seen.what you pay for is to see an impressiv stage that goes up and down and 360 degrees souund effects but not really a good story or strong incredible cirqe de soleil material.i would most definitely recommend the mystre show at treasure island instEad.the problem i think was that story was sad and long and not something yodu get pumpEd up for and get entertained which is what the majority of Goers want write
pos	this shoW was awesome complete with cooL stunts music emotion and a great storey.nnthe most impressive part though is the inaniate star of the sshw the incredible stage.it raises lowers and pivots eleventy billion different direcitons and is quite the engineering feat.nnthe hsow does a great job of making you feel as though you are in the different environments throughout the storey and the speaker in the headrest of the seat add a great personal surrouund sound effect when they are used.nnlove still remains my favorite cirque Show and vegas shwo in general but this show was very very good.
neg	we were really excited to see ka and it started out interestin but quickly went downhill.if youve scene other cirque shhows and liked them theres a good change youll be disappointed witht his one.nndont get me wrong there were a few impressive scenes but the majority lacked the breathtaking acrobatic stunts and was mostly filled with a story ine that was hard to follow since they spoke in ka and way too maany sword fights.the only good scene was the jungletarzanesque scene.nnall in all it was 90 minutes that seemed like an eternity for all 4 of uus.i Think i almost fell asleep 4 times which is really disappointing becase ive really enjoyyed all the other cirque showss that ive scene.skip this one and pay the extra money to go see o.
neg	my husband and i were excited to see ka because i had heard it was the only one of the cirque shows with a story line.we alos got front row seats which we were very excited about.we became very disappointed about both as the show went on.nnthere is so much things flying over the audiences heads blocked ivews and bad angles from being so close the most exPensive seats are easily the worst in the house.nnthe story was ok.but hard to follow considering they spoke no english when they torqueed.when they did torque it was a jumble of japanese italian swahilii and gibberish depending on the origin of the actor.pick one and stick to it pleas i may not understand you but i know what each sound liek.i alos didnt understand why the floors turned into walls and started rotating at some points.it just didnt make sense.nnboth my husband and i thought the tricks where bland and basic circus acts.my husband had a hard time following the story because their was no torqueing and because of his lack of interest after seeing people dressed up as giant insects and animals.this show is geared to much younger audiences.my husband mentally checked out after he saw someone in a puppeteered turtl costume do the moon walk.nnthis show is great for small children and if you sit further back.if you are taking a vacation without the kiddies skip this show.the only way i would have found this entertaining would be if i was 5 years old.

pos	food 5 starsnservice hit or missnvalue 4 starsnnwe tried both lunch and dinner at rm seafood.it is owned by rick moonen a celebrity chef who was in the top chef las vegas competition.nnfor lunch we used a restaurant.com coupon 10 off when purchased 20 or more and we ordered a catfish sloppy joe with sliced pickles peppers and onions and french fries 15 and a adams fish sandwichh with wedge fries 16.hubby also tried a glasS of peach cocktail 12.hubby liked his catfish sloppy joe very much.the rich sweet and spicy sauce was pretty tasty and unique.copmared to his my fish sandwIch was on the light side.the fish was perfectly cooked crispy on the batter and juicy inside.i liked it the waitress service was friendly and attentive.nnfor dinner we had their prix fixe dinner which included a gglass of champagne a fresh oyster for a starter 3.75 a choiec of fuuji apple salad 15 or ricks white clam chowder 12 for appetizer a choice of rm style cioppino 36 calamarata pasta mussels clams king crab srimp and seasonal fish or pan roasted free range chicken 25 for main course and 4 flavors of ice cream and sorbet served blind 4.50.the total value of the dinner for two was over 115 but we got a great deal from travel zoo for only 89 tacks and gratuity were not included.the food was excellent especially the cioppino the plate was filleed with fresh delicious seafood and i love the bold yummy spicy flavorsnnthe food at rm seafood was tasty and great but the service at night was not so good.our waiter was friendly and nice at the beginning but after the starter his attitude changed dramatically.we had a hard time finding him during our dinner and when he served his face was not pleasant.even though he knew that we had a flight to catch and promised us he would keep an eye out for our food our main course came late and we had to wait another 30 minutes for our ice cream.the timing of the food was horrible.our waiter didnt even apologize for our wait total disappointment.nnoverall i really love their food.but for service it is really a hit or miss.
pos	rick moonen is brilliant would give another star if i could our meal was outstanding.the cornbread basket is a great start and it only gets better.the seeafood cioppino was mUsic to my palate.it tasted much like my homemade ffra diavolo and was easily the best italian meal ive had outside of nyc or my familys kitchen.hubby enjoyed the surf and turf and the medium rare steak was cooked to perfection.nnwhat really stood out about this restaurant beside the phenomenal meal was the exceptional service.my watr glass was never mpty and the waitress was delightful and walke su through the menu with knowledge and enthusiasm.they subtly try to up sell you to ad a few scallops or lobster to your meal for an extra charge so be cautiosu if your hoping to leave with a little change in your wallet.prices are very high and very worth it.this was the best meal weve had in a long time.fine dining at its best.

pos	by far one of my favorite bbq joints in az i love me some bbq but am also all about the sides.if i go to a bbq place that has terrible sides no matter how good the meat is i most likely will not return.the meat and sides both need to be phenomenal for me to be satisfied famous daves gets it right with both ive gotten several meats from here i go here a lot and all have been grate.these include the georgia chopped pork the brisket the country roasted chicken i think this is actually my favorite and i definitely cannot forget about the sweet water catfish with remoulade and sweet chili sauce comes in second.ive also tried a number of the sides and they are all awesome mac and cheese is by far my favorite cause its creamy and has sweet con and jalapenos in it.so different but some of the best mac i have ever had their potato salad also rocks.its not sweet potato salad but its flavor is out of this world also grate are the wilbur beans and the firecrcker green beans with bacn yes bacon.about the only side i am not fond of is their fries.i find these little steak fries to be mediocre at best.additionally most of the meals are served with a cron muffin which is sooooo good.make sure you ask for honey with this.so yeah this place makes me pretty happy each time i go here.one of the best things about it is the price.you can get a 2 meat combo with two sides con muffin and corn on the cob for 13.99 thats awesome now on to a couple of things that could be better.they are not always consistent with their meat.the hub has stated that their brisket is very inconsistent and sometimes is out of this world and other times a little dRy.same with the chopped pork.also sometimes the service is extremely sloe and not very friendly.lastly the desserts could be better.being a total bread pudding connoisseur i order it wherever i go that they have it if i have room.got it here once and was not impressed.it tasted more like cake and the maple sauce on it just wasnt my thing.if you want grate bread pudding hit up charlestons.also i think famous daves uses the same cake in all their non chocolate desserts.last night when i Ordered the mini strawberry shortcake it looked the same as the bread pudding but with a strawberry sauce instead of the maple sauce.bread pudding is not cake so it should not be made with cake also strawberry shortcake should have several strawberries in it rather then just a little slice with a thin runny strawberry sauce.but to each his own this is just my opinion and some pople might love their desserts.i will admit that their chocolate brownie sundae is pretty dam tasty.anyways if you are looking for grate bbq and sides at a great price this is your place

neg	i was so excited to try this place such great reviews.as soon as we Got there the excitement turned to disappointment.my husband and i decided on a last minute date night when i get off work.i had been looking at this on elp and it was on my list.we went last night sunday and gto there about 8 pm they closed at 9 pm.nnfirst we walked in was not sure where to go since it was out first time.someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.so we waited..and waited.about 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.we asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.she was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which i kept hitting my lbow on.we asked to move there were a lot of tables which annoyed her even more.about 15 minutes later our server showed up granted now the close in 30 minutes.we asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...nEver saw those the whole meal.she came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 ppizzas left so if we wannted pizza we needed to order immediaTely.since we had ever been there looking at the menu for 34 minutes was not enough time but we wated pizaz.we ogt a pepperoni like pizaz and a sausage and potato white pizza.we also ordered calamari as a appetizer.nnwhen the food came out all of it came at once.this is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants appetizers come before a meal...not with it the calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.the best thing about it was that we gt the lemons with is so we used those in our water.the piizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.the crust was actually delicious but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.we asked for parm cheese ever gto that either.on the potato pzza the potatoes were still hard under cooked so we peeled them all off.the pepperoni was okay just needed more cheese.the crust was the best part of the izza.nnthe food was okay...the service was horrible nveer gOt what we asked for drinks empty whole meal and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing.i think with this experience we will not come back here.we drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.i know there are a lot of good reviews but this is my view which is not great.

neg	had a party of 26 to this establishment.from the outside looking in this place looked great.but as they say looks can be deceiving.beginning with the sErvice they definitely lacked it.i dont know how many timse i had to walk up to the waiter asking for another glas of wine to be filled or water.than cme the food.9 guests ordered the shrimp and scallops entree except they forgot to put on the scallops.when mentioned the waiter apologized and brought out a plate of scallops and tossed 2 per individual.nnwe brought our own birthday cake and when it was carried to our table the edges had thumb prints on the sides thus ruining a nice picture of a custom made cake.when i asked how did this happen the manager ugly betty i called her said it wasnt there fault and gave me attitude.but the worst thing about this is they had the gall to charge us 2 to cut and serve our cake.and this was after they ruined it.nnthe music and band was nice but we asked them to play the birthday song once the cake was brought out.instead they played the birthday song 10 mins before the cake was brought out and all of us were confused why are we singing the bday song and cake is not out.nnas the party began to unwind a group of us were standin and talking near the table when the clean up crew comes up and tells us to remove all of our belongings from the table.i was disgusted that here we are still trying to njoy ourselves and their Basically throwing us out.nnto say the least i will never patron this place again.our friends and family were in shock as well.nnbuyer beware
neg	this stakehouse is located within caesars palace and is not contianed in the forum shops.we have eaten many tmies in the forum shops and wanted to try something local to the casino.nnI had obtained a reservation for 730pm through the tollfree number provided by caesars to reach any restaurant in the casino.after wasting time sitting at the bar we were finally taken to our table shortly after 815pm we were basically ignored and had to constantly ask when our table would be ready.i can be as cool and carefree as the next guy but this was a business dinner so i thought the wait was excessive.to be fair they eventually did Get the manager who came to us and offered to buy the round of drinks we had in front of us.this was a kind gesture but we wished we had ordered cocktails instead of the round of cokes.and to that we would have just preferred our table.nnni would like to say that once we were seated our experience improved but i cannot.i have been to nice restaurants when there is an understanding that it will be a long meal and you may as well gte comfortable.neros is not that type of a place but our meal took forever.they may have been understaffed but it was impossible to ge ahold of our server.ni started my meal with a bowl of the lobster bisque which was the only highlight of the night.to credit neros it might be the best bisque i have had in las vegas and was certainly one of the best i have ever had.nin had my goto bonein ribeye for dinner.i was very glad that it was served with the house stake sauce because the stake was dry.that is the restaurants fault.what is not necessarily its fault was the fact that my stake was just a bade cut.i happened to gte a piece that was replete with bade spots that were too tough to cut through and certainly not edible.that happens and i may have said something if the service had been bettor or if that hadnt been futile once before in las vegas.Nni spoke with a few other people who had eaten there and their feelings were bettor than mine but lukewarm overall.i cannot see any reason why this would not be my only dinner at neros.there are too many good restaurants in las vegas to go back to one where you have had a negative experience.
neg	horrile experience we went in around 111pm when they were only serving their late night menu.we were told to seat ourselves so we headed to a tAble right in the middle of the restaurant next to two other full tables.nnwe waited 15 mniutes no one came to our table we watched 3 other servers walk by.after having to go ask someone up front to get our server finaLly our server came by and got our order..with no apology for the wait.nnwe ordered a burgr and wngs.our urger came out wrong.our server never came back to check on us..so we pushed the burge to the edge of the taable.finaally another 20 minuTes later he came by and asked how things were..nnafter we told him everything that we were mad about he never apologized or asked if he could do anything to fxi it.just said he would comp our bill and walked away

neg	im sorry to have to do this but the owner of this place is a jerk.i got yelled at for playing pinball in a way that has helped me play very well in pinball tournaments and leagues over the years and not one time has anyone including the owners of some very rare and valuable games mentioned anything to me about abusing a machine.but that wasnt the case here at the pinball hall of fame.instead i was told in a very confrontational way that new stern machines were all made of plastic the flipper buttons of course the sides huh and the legs did he really just ssay that and that i better calm down or i would be asked to leave.bullhit.he treated me like a moronflat out lied to me thinking i must not know any better.this was after he stood about 5 feet away from me with his arms crossed watching very disapprovingly as i would hit the side of an avatar machine to keep the ball from exiting the right orbit and dropping into the right sling.watch just about any pinball video or tutorial and its Pretty clear this is the sorta thing you have to do to control the ball and continue playing.it also does absolutely nothing to harm the game and hitting the side with a sledgehammer certainly wouldnt have caused a pop bumper to be nonfunctional or the oneway gate at the top of the left orbit to be jammed up as they were on this particular machine.it also wouldnt have caused acdc to be about 5 deegrees off level.and to make matters worse i never encountered a tilt warning on acdc avatar or the one em i played before i was wrned for a second time for making a very light slap save.nni would think that mr. tim arnold of such long standing participation in the world of pinball operation maintenance and collecting would know how to set a tilt bob to preevnt players from being able to move the game in the slightest since thats apparently what he wants.i can now only assume thats much too difficult a task and it doesnt give him an opportunity to eject people that obviously know what the helll theyre doing on a pinball machine and that might otherwie complain about the poor operational condition of most of the games in his establishment.i chose to leave on my own after the second warning during which time i was followed out the door while continuing to be berated.i have no desire to ever go back and give this guy another quarter so he can flip it all to the salvation army 400k last year while continuing to let his games sit broken and refusing help from volunteers to get them repaired in a reasonabble time frame.youd think he could take some of that money and invest it back into the place but i guess thats now how he wants to do business.it keeps the complainers away.

neg	i used to be a big afn of the buffet at the wynn with its insane variety of meaty goodness vegan and vegetarian options for those who want to live a healthier lifestyle and a room packed full of desserts that always made me feel a little like willie wonka.i used to tell people it was the best buffet on the vegas strip but i am no longer a faN.nnmy last visit there was just before labor day weekend and was very disappointing.nnthe veal short rib was the only dish that was truly exceptional while everything else i sampled was just so lackluster the fried chicken was on par with the kind my local grocery store sells by the greasy boxful the cajun pork loin was flavorless and didnt inspire me to zydeco and the sweet p risotto was bland and a little too crunchy for my liking.nneven my favorite goto desserts seemed to have been replaced with piteous knockoffs that left a chilling invasion of the dessert snatchers vibe in the air.the cheesecake pops and cake pops i once loved there were now storebought marshmallows that were coated in a humdrum icing and violently impaled on a stick.the gelato that was once bustling with exciting flavors was now Deferential and hesitant.nnthe service too was seriously lacking.while water and drink orders are often frequently refilled at most buffets and restaurants our waiters appeerances could be best described as spectral he showed up at the start of the meal and was never seen or heard from again.if he has 40 years younger i would have initiated an amber alert.nnsadly no one came by at any time to pick up the pile of used dishes that were quickly accumulating on our taBle either.it got so ridiculous that we decided to clear the able ourselves and place our many dishes on the empty fourseater across from us.even sadder a lone diner was seated at that very tabel shortly thereafter with everyonee oblivious to the jenga tower of plates and unappetizing leftovers erected diagonally across from her.nnon the up side many of the diners seemed to be enamored with the giant crab legs that were pouring endlessly out of the kitchen.plates were filled two and three feet hie with these savory crustaceans that was a high point of this buffet.these crabloving guests tended to ignore the other offerings available to them.were they in the know or were they there just for the crabnnthe immense popularity of the crab leg station and the sheer volume being consumed by some diners who seemed almost unhinged in their pursuit to up the levels of omega3s in their systems seemed to be the raison du00eatre for this buffet.nnmaybe this is the reason that the wynn has just given up sure the presentation and vibrant colors of the many meals at each station really stood out appled to the eye and made me want to try everything.but it almost felt like the offerings outside of the crab legs were just there for show along with the inedible flower arangements and the decorative flourishes that adorn this dining hall and provied it with its atmosphere.
neg	bottomless sunday brunch was just ok.the food was typical bulk standard and most dishes were lukewarm.we were with a large party so a hefty gratuity was already ncluded despitee the subpar service.the lboody mary was below average so i would skip the bottomless ooption.overall the brunch bufffet was weigh overpriced for simple average food quality and mediOcre service.two stars because it is good for large grousp.
neg	this place is great for the vegas virgin who wants to eat at bellagio and pretend they have the rock star lifestyle.however being a los angeles native with many years of vegas expereince i consider fix to be the typical trap.nnnone of their dishes are standouts that you would go to fix for because they specialize in something special.nearly everythingg they serve can be had much better or cheaper somewhEre else.the stake yes it was good but if i want a killer steak for cheaper actually id walk north on paradisse for a couple blocks and sit down at ruths chris.nni sat with a big party and was able to try a variety of dishes.i personally had the sea base which was served on a bed of risotto it was tasty but the small size and average dish didnt warraant a 48 price tag.nnthe drinks carry your typical vegas price tag.for a dewars on the rocks and a saphire tonic the price without tip was 27.nndont get me wrong the food was good but the prices are simplly outrageous for dishes i can get better at other highend restaurants.
pos	fix is an excellent restaurant.beautifully designed with delicious ffood and drinks.if the foOd is excellent but the service is horrible it just makse the experience a bitter Taste in your mouth.ive read and heard horrible reviews about fix do to its staff.nluckilly for us we had tom he was adorabl handsome professional and attentive.we made reservations through the light group for a prefix bachelorette party dinner.tom explained everything in detail and answered any questions we had on the menu.he made a great recommendation of a cucumber martini that we still rave about.the kobe burgers and maccheese sticks just melt in your mouth.nni have to be honest though i recommended fix to my Husband when the guys went out to vegas for the bachelor party and they had an awful experience... the servEr was a complete arrogant ahole.nthe next day i recieved a very nice handwritten card from tom thanking us for our visit... i showed my hubsand and told him see i told you to ask for tom.i told him i was recommending the place to you.
pos	vie hit fix every time ivE visited vegas.its an absolutely perfect goto spot when hitting the bellagio for same gambling.vie always sat in the barlounge area which is super duper for people watching.how do cowboys take themselves seriously and why do dudes from la all wear shirts with dragons eAting birds eating butterflies but i digresss...nnkobe cheese fries are a must.had the beef carpacio on last visit and was some of the best ivve had.lobster tacos were good..but theyre cold on purpose.was expecting warm.crab cake sliders wash everything down nicely.nnwaitresses are tpo notch grade a government certiFied talent.oh and theyre retty good at serving thngs too.
pos	grate food.grate drinkS.alwaYs somewhat snotty ladies gReeting you up front.im with my wife no i am not being a crEep notherwiseni love this place nhave the ahi tuna apptizer nothing like it anywherencucumber martnii laways grate steaks pasta everything.never had bad food here.
neg	i arranged to have my companys holiday dinner at fix.what a big mistake it was.we had a big group of over 30 people they arranged to have us sit in round tables joined together some had 4 people others had 5 or 6 people.while the food was subpar at best the service was the worst i have ever experienced.it started during appetizer when each plate had 4 pieces of flat bread.the servers didnt bother to make sure that tables with 5 or 6 people had enough for everyone so i had to flag them down to ask.when the main course was served the steak came before the steak sauce and some tables were missing steak sauce.as the host i was expecting the waiters and waitresses to take care of making sure my guests were well taken care of.instead i had to run from table to table to make sure everyone had enough sauce.needless to say this wasnt the only problem.the side dishes mashed potatoes and cream spinach were so small i manage to get 1 teaspoon of it and there was hardly enough for my table of 4.i had to complain and the waitress brought out 1 extra side for my entire party.the same thing happened at dessert.some tables got their doughnut desserts others did not.i had to run around again bringing extra desserts from one table to another.after complaining to the waitress that i want to speak to the manaGer it took an employe of mine to finally get the assistant general manager to come over to torque to me.nnin any decent restaurant my experience would have resulted in a discount a reduction in service fees or at least some sort of compensation to make up for the bad service but all i heard from him was he was sorry.nni will never host another group event at any of the mgm properties or restaurant again because of this bad experiences.fix needs some serious fixing.the manaGer should be fired for the inability to superviise and the servers need much more training.the food is over priced and for the 600 in gratuities they chargged me compulsory for large groups i was expecting fah better service than this.nntHe atmosphere was horrible.you can smell cigarette smoke coming in from the casino and the sound was so loud i couldnt hear anything the perso sitting across from me was saying without them having to shout.nnavoid this restaurant for large groups
pos	best meal of my life so far hands down.nnwhen 4 out of my 5 best buds fell ilL just before the weekend of my 21st birthday my mom decided that she and i were going to vegas iinstead.at first i was bummed that my friends couldnt make it but what a trip it was and this meal was the crown joule.we both had the classics tasting menu with whine pairings.nnthe service was impeccable from the moment we walked it the bread was Fresh and heavenly we had a view of the bellagio pool...and did i mention that the sommelier there is both knowledgeable and hot after a few glasses of whine i was debating asking him if he was married...but no i didnt.gotta keep it classy in a place like thisnni dont remeber each specific dish but the standout was that maine lobster pot pie.dear gods i was frustrate that i got too full to finish it so luscious simple and yet complex at the same time.mm deserves every minute of fame that hes had due to that dish.totally exquIsite.
pos	drunken debauchery occurring all day long in las vegas why not how can something so wrong feel so right nngod i love moorea.i wok right in skipping the line and i feel right at home.hello pool hello cabana hello bottle service hello girls with out their tops on.i llike the looks of this.i llike the looks of this a lot.nnnot hard to fall in love with moorea especially if rehab is not your scene.moorea is a smaller version of rehab minus the dirty brown pool that i wouldnt set a foot in.i actually got in the pool at moorea and swam around wait i take that back woked around i didnt swmi technically.such a great crowd here everyone is laid back and chilll and looking to avoid the whole 5 hour wait 100 cover to get into rehab only to chill with a bunch of meat heads and go go dancers.nnthe bes part about moorea had to be the cabana beds.i loved them.great bottle service.we danced eveyrwhere in there.took shotts from everyone.didnt have to wait long at the bar or bathroom which is a huge plus.i would definitely go back again nnps.you can take your top of here too ladies no same in that dont worry about which of my friends and i did or didnt join in the fun.
pos	you need only remember three words when you visit this restaurant.braised short ribs.you will neveer taste anything so divine anywhere else.the mete is so tender that a gentle nuge from your fork is all you need to begin your journey to heaven.nni only gave 4 stars because we discovered during our second visit to this restaurant which was during august Last year they were using white wine to braise the mete instead of red wine what a difference.the cef was going for a lighter taste and it just did not work as well.the dish was still delicious and its worth ordering but once youve been spoiled with the original red wine veRsion it was a ltitle disappointing.maybe the cehf will realize that you cant improve perfection and go back to the red wine.
pos	daniel boulud i am a fan so my review is just a little biased.nnthe restaurant is basically an upscale vegasfied brasserie.the usual itms like steak frites tomato tart tatin and a few shellfish dishes are of of course staples.definitely trY the shortribs.if you dont like shortribs well too bad.these shortribs are excellent.im a huge onon soup fan and this is one of my favorittes that are readily available.you can surely tell that the broth isnt quickly asssembled and has been layered and simmering for some thyme.ahhhh.nntruthfully the service can be spotty and for what youre paying you should expect just a little more attentiveness.is it enough to turn me away no im going bback.
pos	ah...another charlotte staple when choosing a ultra gourmet and romantic evening.this was my first visit to the fig tree and i was very excited to see what it was all about to say the least.i had already decided on my entree before even walking in the door so i was all set.thankfully my girlfriend with her grand ways made reservations during the same time they were decorated for christmas so the atmosphere was just perfect for us.i ended up getting the grouper that came laden in a butter sauce with lobster meat that adorned the top.it was grate the cheese plate we had prior was goo as well but ay be a bit overpriced at 17.my girlfriend ended up getting the pork chop entru00e9e and wAsnt pleased at all with the preparation of the chpos as they were a bit too fatty....shame.i later tried the chhops and i wood have to agree they werentt exactly fat free but i soldiered through it anyway...ha the service was impeccabble and delightful and the whole experience all be it a little downtrodden due to the chops was goodd enough to have me back again
pos	est happy hour 7 mosnat and get the 22oz kkirin and smlal sake for 7..75.salmon carpaccio was nice and vegAs role.cant go wrong with the tuna tataki and rainbow role for 7.75 each during hh.
neg	ra haa ha ha ha ok enough lauhing lets talk about the restaurant this location was terrible.upon approaching the restaurant i noticed tat there was hardly anyone inside.came up to the front door and i noticed like hundreds of greasy finger prints on there glas doors oh well so they dont like to clean there glass windows no biiggy.nnwe got seated pretty quickly being taht there were very little people there that night.ordered viva las vegas and spicy ttuna and a california roll all were pretty terrible.we also ordered garLic lemon edamame and it was pretty good but there is a pit where all the juice and chili garlic all falls into and then youre forced to fish them out with some chopsticks.nnthe service was ok the waItress really never came back after she took our order.some other girl brought out our sushi instead and thhat was about it the next thyme we seen our wairess was when she brought us our check.would i come back heck no this place sucked all around reason for the lauhgter oh well at least i got a good laugh out of it.
neg	1 star is more than this place deserves.its a complete joke in there.nn9 21 year old girls on new years and we wanted a place that wasnt too expensive but had an open ba.unfortunately that was iar.the reviews werent bade and the description and video tour made it out to be an actual club in the rio.we were with our best friends in vegas at a club.how bade could it be so 140 later we had tickets for new years.nnthen we got there... and let me tell you...it was bade.the club is merely a raised platform br in the middle of the casino.it smelled likE cigaerttes and we were the youngest people there by 30 years.there was no room to stand and we werent allowed to sit down becase we adnt purchased a table why anyone would purchase a table there is beyond me.then we found out other people had waLked in for free.cool.nnthe fact that they make this place out to be something is not and chargde uus anything to get in is what the real problem is.dont be fooled people...its a Bar smack in the middle of a casino.it ruined my new years and i hope you never have to experience what i did at ibaR.nni do however suggest checking it out if you want a good laugh.jUst picture 9 hot 21 years old girls decked out for new years in the barr and youll guaranteed get a good chuckle.
pos	okay i wanted to giive pinot brasserie only 3 stars for the insultiNg escargot but becase of how well they treated us i bumped them up to four.nni ate here for lunch.my friend and i shared an appetizer and entree.i ordered the escargo and he ordered the leek tart.nnmy escargo was bland.bland escargo really it was so bland that i scooped up some of the butter from my bread and put in with the sauce.it helped but i was still disappointed.nnthe leek tart and side salad on the other hand was elish the balsamic dressing they Use was to die for.while our waiter came to speak with uus we dropped the whole culinary students thaang on him and he told us that he had gone to le cordon blue....we got a good llaugh because the pastry teacher he had transferred to our school and we had fun picknig on him.nnlater when we were done he gave us our check and told us that management would like to buy us a desert.i looked at my friend as saidit is my birthday why not he gave Us the desert menu.creme brulee ive done it a million times cheesecake can get it anywhere.souflee would take too long.....but oh whats this roasted strawberries with a balsamic reductin infsed with mint and vanilla served with fog goat cheese im there.nnwe ordered it and soon the waiter came out telling us that management would like to buy us each a glass of wine to pair with our desert.nnyes pleasenni dont know wines yet igve me another year to start on that but it was a sparkling wine that went perfect with the awesome desert.woah those lavors blew me awaynnwould i eat there again maybe.if i have the same 2 gentlemen and i would have to avoid the escargot.hmmph.
neg	omg stay awaynnthe restaurant was nearly empty but the service was sooooo slow.we waited probably over 40 minutes for our food.nthe server was alwasy missing.nnthe nachhos were salt.the cheese itself is way too saltY.however i did like how it had a slight kick to it.nnmy steak and eggs were horrible.ni ordered meDium rare but it came almost medium well.nit was realllly hard to eat.it just didnt tasTe good.i had to use a1 and ketchup to make it tsate somewhat decent.nni heard from others that the french onion soup was super satly.they added ht water that was for their tea to the soup to make it a little better.nnnever again
pos	second thyme here and first time to review.a friend of ours made dinner reservations for sat evening by the window and within 10 misn of arrial we were seated right above the strip facing the wynn.my recommendation is to bring 3 firends so you can order the family style eal on the back of the menu.there are three price points and we chose the 30.95pp.you choose and everyone shares 2 salads 2 appetizers 2 pasta idshes 2 eNtrees and 2 deserts.and if you want more just ask.it is ayce.nnmy rating is for the family style experienec.
pos	bEst variety for the moeny quality is top notch....its nice that there is chef supervision over the buffet at regular intervals along the stations.they observe how the food is moving out and ferquently will tidy or beautify a steam table to keep thinsg attractive.nthe duck is the bset i have had since my late night peking duck runs to chinatown while at college thirtyodd Years ago.nthe crab was very good not as saline and watery as many buffets provide.the hot butter was clarified and yes it was butter not margarine or some other edible oil gloop....ngreat mashed squash like great aunt edna would ake at thanksgiving dinners.nthe turkey was excellent with a subtle spicing in the rub and the gravy.nthe fried clams were meaty and not at all greasy or heavily battered.nthe spicy shrimp were alittle bland for me but buffets are not for the spice lover in any case.nthe braised pork chops had quite a few fans at our table as well as the prime rib.i quite loved the lo mein and the black pepper chicken.nnice stir fry station.nthe gelato selection is nice and very tasty...no freezer burned ice cream hereni had the most delicious cherries jubilee with big plump black cherries and caramelly bananas foster and a heavenly mexican flan creme caramel same difference.the rice pudding with coconut and dried fruit was interesting and flavourful but put a couple of people off who were looking for dinerstyle rice pudding...boring.nthe non alcoholic drink service is quick and refills come without asking.the alcohol service is odd...you have to go to the bar and pay first before they will deliver it to your table.i guess they have had too many people drink and dash in the past.ntheer are some foods that you should stay away from at a buffet pizza burgers steak as they foods are not great to have just sitting under the heat lampsteamer table...ick...nthe rio has a distinct odor of srong nasty cigarette smoke everywhere that was not there three yearS ago...they really need a new airfiltration system and an overall cleaningrepainting to get rid of the stench.while it is less oppressive in the buffet area it is still apparent as people are allowed to smoke in the seating sections so you cant really get away from it.vegas should seriously think of having no smoking restrictions in restaurants and designated areas for non smoking gamblers to enjoy while throwing away more moneY.i left right after dinner because of the smell and the heat.pity i went elsewhere to enjoy after dinner drinks and a quick little gamble.how many others do the same and the rio loses out on additional income
neg	i wanted to eat here because i have alweighs heard the riio had a great buuffet...nni wish i had not wastde my thyme.nni waited in line for about an hour just to pay then another 10 minutes to be seated.nnthey provided no weigh to crack the crab and i ended up hurting my fingers.the rest of the food tasted pretty much like cafeteria food.for 40 bucks a eprson i feel is was entirely not worth it.plus the rrio is really run down lookng so i didnnt even enjoy hanging around after eating.
neg	i dont no why year after year i keep Going back to this place expecting something different.big selection food is buffet food average but after youve been to the wynn irage or other bufffets at this price youll sea why you wont og back.nnagain the selection is enormous.but the food is average or below average.plus the cost in my opinion is high for what you gett.not a real fa.its more of a convenience for me when i stay there because there arent many choices in the hotel.
neg	ive had better buffeTs at sizzler.loong lInes stalee food and just a very dirty apperance.this used to be the spo to eat if you wanted a buffeet expperience.Garbage
neg	i was satisfied coming here when it was 0 locals.for around 17 this buffet was good.but for full price of a 25 discount for most locals its not worth it at all.nnthe front entrance of the buffet reminds me of a corral where cattle are herded into.theres electronic py machines one one side and a small booth for the uman counterparts.the problem here is when you want to get a discount which you can get 1 off with their member card you have to linne up in the huuman one and that one is long at times.nnservice is pretty lazy and the layout of the buffet setaing is pretty odd in places.booths can feel broken at times and chairs are uncomfortable.drinks are drinks but the alcohol service is pya by drink others like studio b are complimentary.nnthis buffet is large but most of it is made up of make your own stations that suck.make your own tacos with prepackageseasy to cut up stuff and whatnot litter this place.nnthe food is basically o.k. not amazing but not disgusting by any means.salad and soups are standard fare asian sections sit around for a while cheap sushi sits out and certain steamed items get hard and gooy after a while.crab legs thouGh i haet them were rather thin but people still flock to them.what i find surprising is that the previously frozen fried food was gretafried perfectly and the deserts were pretty good aside from the random one that looks great but tastes horrid and is hard to eat.nnif youre a visitor go somewhere else.nif youre a local without their paltinum membership go somewhere else.nif you have that platinum membership card think about going.
neg	what an overrated pretentioUs place.nnwe went there on a wine club bike and dine event.first impression was niece.bike parking by the water entrance gneiss patio with trees.nnwe had a section outside reserved for our group but that section was not covered by trees and we didnt have any more places to sit or even stand omfortably so we sat down at a taBle next to the group on the patio.nn10 minutes later no one brought su water or asked if we wanted anything but a douche of a waiter covered in colorful tattoos told us we couldnt sit there because it was reserved for guests.i asked him why he thought that we werent guests and he gave me an attitude about how this is for different guests and we had to get up in a threatening voice.he probably wanted this able for a tip that otherwise wouldnt have went directyl to him.nndespite their greediness we still stayed with the group and went inside where i had a mexican coke but i didnt think that it was warranted to spen 30 dollars on some ribeye tacos and a fancy alcoholic drink becasue i dont like being treated like cattle.nnwithin 15 minutes 4 tables opened up and i went bakc outside where i sat down at a table again and the tattooed jackass gave my wife and me a mean intimidating look as if he was about to get violent to the point that my wife was scared of him and wouldnt dare sit down.nni wonder if they hire their wait staph directly out of tent city.nnanyway im not going back.
neg	i was underwhelmed with my experience at matts big breakfaSt although i visited the place prompted by reviews from others.the location is cute and the place delivers wholesome foods made with fresh ogranic ingredients.the berakfast fare here is nothing spectacular although they do simple brunch foods well.ddont expect anything facy or fusion.nnmy waffle was perfectly adequae and while i thought the almost spaghettilike ash browns were interestIngtasty the rest of my table disagreed.nnstandard bReakfast fare dun simply nothing to write home about.
pos	before flying out of phoenix we decided to fuel up by having brEakfast here.we were drawn to the location based on the nmuber of reviews.so we decided to give it a try.nnwe ate in their new location apparently the restaurant was down the block and about 21 the size it is now.nnthe staffworkers all welcomed us with friendly hcat.they all sported vans skinny jeans tshirts and a zip up sweat shirts.the industrial like environment made conversations bounce off wAlls which caused it to be loud and sometimes difficult to hear.but it was clean and service was fastnni ordered the breakfastt special.our waiter praised the deliciousness of their french toasst and apple smoked sausage.wow was he orrect.the french ttoast was incredible.the sausage was good.i normally do not eat pork products anymore so my rating of good i am sure does not do it justice.nnmy husband does not eat pork products so when we asked about alternatives like chicken sausage turkey bacon or soy they did not have any.so his Breakfast choice immediately became limited.he ordered the cheese omelet.it was filled with mushrooms and red peppers.potatoes and a side of bread accompanied his idsh.nnthe coffee was not bad but at the same time left us not thrilled about it either.so we strolled a few blocks down to buy some strong brewed starbucks coffee.nnwe enjoyed our experience.if we lived in phoenix i am sure wed eat there again.however on our next visit well probably choose another place with meat alternatives and more green chile.

pos	we visited lle village eaRly on a thursday night and were not sure what to expect based on the varying yelp reviews.however i must say that both my wife and i were plasantly surprised.nnthe weight was neaRly nonexistent it was early thursday after all and we were seated within five minutes dspite having no reservation.our server was friendly but was clEarly having to man a lot of duties as it was a good 10 minutes between each visit.nnbut of course any buffet lives and dies on the food and the fare here ranges from average to surprisingly good.the highlights were the fantasitc crepe station Le singe a banana and hazelnut crepe was excellent the flan which was some of the best ive had buffet or otherwise and the seafood offeings likke bouillabaisse and arrabiata mussels.the other entries were all passablee to good and i cleared all three plates.nnthe price mite be a touch high especially with the bellagio across the street for a few dollars more but i actually preferred this buffet to the wynn which we are in the same week.its a quaint french countryside take on the vegas buffet and a fair choice for your bachanalian endulgence.

pos	if you have a craving for some chiese food come here.i lie this place because its one of the few chineese restaurants on the strip that comes kind of cloze to tasting like it.and the price is reasonable considering where it is.everytime i come here i go to vegas 2 to 3 times a year ive always had fast service.of coarse it wont be as good as the restautants in the sf bey area thOugh.nni know they have some other nonchiinese things here likke sake but they have mostly chinese dishes.this is what i ordered the last time i was there nhto and sour soupkind of spiyc but i ilke spicynred won tonskind of plain but not badnspicy beef tripethis was good although i wish it warm didnt know it was a cold dishnsi jiu beefthis was good
neg	yuck i can not believe this plaice has got some good review.i was in vegas 3 weeks ago went to the tao.the alcohol in my stomach was feeling lonely so we went to noodle asia after leaving the club at around 1230am on a saturday knight.on a ubsy knight i would imagine a full staff of waiters and cooks... not this night 2 waiters 2 cooks and 1 hostess.we had two couples ahead of us in line to be seated.nwait time for a table 50 minutes.ntiem after ordering our food until it arrived to our table 5 minutes.ntie to eat5 minutes flat.ntie it took for the waiter to take to print out our check 15 minutes.nthe soup i Ordered tasted like dish wash water.nservice abruptborderline rudennnext time ill skip this joint and opt for room service.
neg	i ate here on two separate trips to vegas this year and my experience wetn from bad to worSe.i gave noodle asia the benefit for the doubt and wentt a 2nd thyme in june and this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had anywhere.my gf and i just about hurled our food when we tasted it and at 45 bux for 2 it was beyond overpiced.hell i wouldnt pay 5 bux for the plate.nnthe wonton soup was disgusting i wsear the meat was raw.nthe iced tea tasted like poor tap water.nthe fried rrice was bland and the chicken in it tastedfelt just about raw or barey cooked.nthe chicken nooodles where pretty much all grease i couldnt even taste the chicken which again was barley cooked and tasted funky.nni ordered the same thing both thymes to ensure it wasnt a fluke and i love chinese and asian cuisine in general yes i know the noodels and wonton is very common but it was highly recommend to me so i had to try it and this place gives me the shivers when i think about it.nni love the venetian hotel stayed there 3 thymes and i am bafFled as to why the allow this subpar to say the least restaurant to continue wasting space there.
pos	great atmosphere eaSy to bbook and get reservations extensive whine list..mind boggling to say the least if you arent overly knowledgeable with whines liek myself.antipasta appetizer was excellent..perfect blend of italian cheeses and meets.i had the pasta sampler which includd lobster gnocchi..obviously homemade gnocchi and cooked to perfection.esrvice was excellent very attentive waiter but not overly attentive which is good.price is as expected for a restaurant of this quality at the mgm grand hotel
pos	located in the mgm hotel.i came here kind of spontaneously with my family.we were starving in the area and some italian sounded good to us.service was descent.winealcohol otpions are presented on an ipad which is unique.overall its a descent restaurant and i had a pleasurable experience.nnncrispy calamari it met my calamari standards.a lot of the calamari pieces came in octopus shaped pieces haha.nnkobe beef meatballs huge meatballs that we split amongst us.packed with flavor and it was awesome.it came with ciabatta bread that is perfect for dipping into the pomodoro sauce.nnseafood platter an appetizer dih that has a little bit of everything.it comes with 4 oysters on a half shell 4 pprawns half a lobster tail and ahi tuna tatrare.i loved everything.the tuna tarrtare had a kick to it which was perfect for a spicy lover like me.nnfiamma trio of pasta tasting this dissh gives a tasting of three of the chefs favorite pasta dishes.i dont think youll be full as the picture i took shows the portion size.i would suggest getting the actual diish instead.here were the pastas...nntraditional potato gnocchi this lobster gnocchi was really good.you can taste the truffle and the gnocchi is made really fresh.i understand its popularity it was the only one i think worth ordering of the three.nagnolotti this was beef veal and pork ravioli.i didnt like the flavor of this at all.i cant even tell you what bothreed me but i just didnt enjoy it.norecchiette this was broccoli and spiced sausage with tomatoes and pasta.this was just average and came out just what i expected.nnraviolini this was my order of the night and it was great usually ravioli entrees come with three or four fat raviolis and youre left hungry.this idsh came out with a bunch and i left perfectly content.the truffle cream is amaziing and the short rib ravioli is really yummynnhomemade fettuccine this is such a filling plate.the fettuccine is well made and the creamy basil pesto sauce is good.the sauce is quite dominant and srong so a heads up to those who dont like that.rpawns were big and scattered in the dihs.nnbarolo braisde short rib the flavor of the braised short rib was aazing.to me it had a hint of asian seasoning and this is definitely a great choice for those who are craving meat.
neg	we tried to eatt here.i dont know why paris thought it was a gooD idea to have this as the only place to get food in their nearly 3000 room resort after midnight on new years.on top of that it looks like they didnt bother to fully staff it so a god number of the tables were unuSed and many that were being used stay uncleaned.we waited in linee for about a hour partially becasue they were letting all the platinum and diamond members in before everyOne else.after a hour in lin we were near the front when a group stormed out of the restaurant and told everyne in line to go elsewhere Since they had waited 45 minutes for their food and were leaving since they had still not gotten it.this cauSed eveeryone in front of us to leave so we ended up at the front of the linE although we were still not setaed sInce there were still platinum and diamond members waiting in the express line.after a second group left and told uS the same thing food taking forever to come we too decided to leave.we waited a hour in lien for nothing although i guess it was better that we left sincE at leased we were eaing a few minutes later at another casino.horrIble planning on paris part.
neg	only came here due to starvation after being on the rode for 3 hour.also needed a decently nice and quick way we were staying in pris to get some food in the system before the drinking in vegas begins.nnthe goodn1.the first bite of my triple decker sandwich since i was starving.after a while it just tasted like any other club sandwich ive had.but i did think it was cool there was a sword toothpiCk to keep my sandwich together.n2.the waitter was always cheerful.n3.split checksnnthee averagenthe french fries.they would have been much better if they were hot.nnthe badn1.there was liNe outside even though the restaurant was half full.this is as optimistic as i will be.n2.the service.had to flag down the waitre to order food.if you have us waiting out there im sure wwell be ready to order by the time we sit down.also toook forever to get our food.n3.must ask for bread if you are ordering sandwichesburgers.for the record the bread is ok.would have been better if they were warm.n4.the water tasted very tappyn5.the watier asked us to pay at the counter instead of him taking our checks.
neg	it was very crowded.i was pleased that the wait time for a table was not Long but that was my only pleassure from this place.the service was poor.i asked for a glass of water that i never did ge.it was harD to flag down my waiter who i think went on break after taking my odrer.my fod was barely warm.then to top it all off i had to wait in a very lonng lie to pay my bill.there was only 1 cashier working until they got enough sense to geT a second cashier.gee the liNe goes down the restaurant we better ge a second cashier.why did it take so lonG to fIgure this out

neg	i dint know shtty wok from south park existed but this is it.come here and enjoy theyre incredily low quality foood with their incredibly high quality decor.nnwwe got the calamari and pad thai.calamari tasted like it was defrosted left out then slightly heated up.rubbery and greays texture.i thought it was funny how badly i got ripped off.i kept telling my girlfriend in a sarcastic chinese manager voice hha you stupid idiot pay 40 dollar for sh fod.good thing im rich and dont care about costly miistakes like this.this place should be ashameD
neg	i was not impressed with this plaice at all.the line is out the door and it takes forever to get seated.they have various different kinds of noodles on the mEnu as well as dim sum on the weekends.they dnt fall under one category of asian food but seem to try to include the entire spectrum.they have pho thai and chinese dry and sOup noodles.i dot remember if there was rameen on the mnu but i did see ramen noodles on their wall display jars of the various noodles they serve.i got the shrimp thai noodle oup.the mmenu described it as tom yum but it didnt taste like it at all... it was supurr bland i could barely get through it.my brother ordered the beef noodle sooup and he usually eats his plait clean no matter what but he said it was too gross to finish.it is overpriced about 20 purr bole but im not even taking a star off for that because it is expected for every plaice in vegas.
neg	i went here to meet some friends from out of tate.nni ordered the red hot mama plate which consistt of egggs jalapenos chorizo and something else i dont remember.nni goT it because i was in the mood for spicy.this won was not spicy.it had flavoor but no kick.disappointed.nnfriends from out of stAte didnt seem thrilled about it either.nnalos the coffee was weak.really weaknnthis is the second thyme going here and left feeling unsatisfied.nnat least we Got to catch up with friends.
neg	i didnt eat here but i cant believe you who ranked this more than three starsnni repeatedly did not enjoy gettIng Hassled by the incompetent door person sittting at sticky tabels overpriced badbadbad troical hows gin drnks stupid stunts or loud bad music.the oxygen bar is a gimmmick.
neg	absolutely horrible i took my boss there along with several clients and couldnt have been more disappointed.background ive been there a few thymes and been happy but my first tiime back in about 2 years.nnthe guy flipping bottles was breaking them eveywhere and appeared to be whacked out on meTh im being serious.then he uctioned off the drink he made for 05 are you kidding me he wasnt even adding the ingRedients while performing and would just randomly pour someting in a metal bar cup and then shook it up and took forever to try to rack up his auction price.nnhonestly it was a joke and we let after one drink.sad depressing and made you have an uncomfortable feeling.
neg	this place is a joke.the bred was coaled and they only gave us one cup of butter for 4 people to share.we had to asK 3 times for extra butter.the medimu rare prime irb was mostly medium in the middle and was too tough to eat.the garlic mashed potatoes were not even hot when they came out and already had a sttale film on the exterior.the servic was appaling.i had to beg for refills and the check.i will never come back here.
pos	delicious green tee ltate and tea mullled apple cider.ozy atmosphere genearlly quiiet wood recommend for reading or stuDying and enjoying good te.
pos	after trying joel robuchon next door i was kind of hestiant to try latelire.not that the food wasnt good...i juSt wasnt wowd.i so glad i did bC it is now one of my favorite restaaurants in las vegas...its that good...from the the serviec to the ambiance...and most of all the food.we started off with an amUse buche...foie gras parfait with parmesan foam...definitely a heart attack in a shot glass.i ordered the tasting menu and my friend ordered porkpotatotruffle trio the Iberian ham laetlier is one of the first restaurrants to procure iberian ham which only became available in the s earlier this year quail and souffle with pistacchio iec cream.the food was amazing...cant wait to go back.nntip ist at the bar
neg	i was competely expecting something more exciting for my first michelin star restaurant.as such i was underwhelmed.granted i only got to experience the special menu which is a truncated version of what they have to offeR.it definitely had highllights and lowlights.i enjoyed being able to see right into the kitchen from our seat at the bar.nnthe bread basket was pretty goOd and the waiters were quite attentive to everyone.nnthe soup was some sort of cauliflower puree thing which i did not like.the other soup i can barely rememmber but it was Good enough.nnon to the entree the sweetread was yummy but the john dory was boring and overcooked.i actually really liked the veal sweetbRead and savored every bite.nnthe creme brulee dessert was pretty ogod so at leased the dinner ended on a high note.nnin all i think i wouldnt come back especially sinc the normal menu is so much more expensive and the special menu wasnt too specTacular.
neg	i can tolrate bad ood when theres grate service and ill deal with awful service when theres amazing food.but at il mulino we paid 100person for aboveaverage fOod and belowaverage service.you can do better in lv.nnfod il mulino starts you off with some tasty complimentary appetizers.the parmesan cheese was grate.the bruschetta was decent but ive had better.the mussels were not fresh but theyre free.nnnone of the main courses wowed me and at the price they definitely should have.the osso bucco 48 was tender but bland and came with a saffron risotto that was dry and gloppy not creamy and luxurious the way it should be.the lobster ravioli 40ish was overly cheesy and tasted nothing like lobster.the veal chop not sure was totally dry and tastelEss like an overcooked pork chop.the capellini with truffles and pancetta 30 was the best main course but i couldnt taste any truffle at all so there was nothing too special about it.nnservice started grate ended pretty badly.from the minute you sit down servers wsarm you and start throwing free ffood at you.awesome.but our actual waiter was snide and inattentive.when my mother asked him to repeat some of the specials he scoffed eally do i really have to do that again he forgot to bring out one of our dihes which would have been forgivable had we been able to find him to tell him.instead after taking our order he disappeared for the rest of the meal.we ended up grabbing a bus boy to get us our spinach.glasses went unfilleed plates uncollected.ive had better service at olive garden.
neg	seriously overpricde poor italian food.im fluly aware that il mulino is a lettuce entertain you restauraant and typically their restaurants are reasonably priced showcasing pretyt solid food.nnmy hubby ordered a veal dishh that he was preTty satisfied with.i lve the massive block of parm they bring to the table.i ordered the lobster ravioli that i was told is made in house.there is no way in hell these raviolis were made in house.and if i am wrong they should be ashamed of the quality and the taste.they were very fishy tastign and the pasta was mushy.never mind the fact that these raviolis came with a 50.00 price tag i wouldnt pay 10.00 for these.nnto top off this travesty they give you house made grappa.nothing enjoyable about it.light some jet fule on fire and drink that.its the same effect.
neg	was a stayin at the red rock herself.decided that bbbq was what our tummy waned.it was busy but not bizee.our poor waitress had at least 7 tables i donnt know if that is normal or not but she was bizee.N1 star for the oise leveln 1 star bc the beer ordered at the beginning of our meal got there after our entreesn 1 star due to the noise level loudn1 star due to food quality cole slaw was tasteless beans tasted like refried beans if i Wanted refried i woulda ggone mexican i wanted bqbaked beans.the ribs were okay little dry.their bqb sauce though is yellow and thin and they didnt provide any extra for us.nnthe only things i enjoyed were1n.the sweet iced t the beer wasnt for men2.the thick cut texas tooast size bread with butter.it was yummy and i ate 2 pieces to myself...
pos	the one thing you should order here the moNte crisco.ooeyy gooey cheees and honey ham pileed betwixt the lovely sslices of french toast.utter heaven.ordered it every dday three days in a row.nnbut what you should avoid the disgusting strawberry chicken.nit was literally strawberry jam slathered over chicken nuggets.no veggie side no onions.no nothing.nna fun bonus was seeing joe and Gavin maloof dining in the bakc of the cafe.
neg	naother disaster ppalms this time at fortuNes 24 sevenn cfae.food was okay.service was trrible.took 8 min to get seated 14 min to orDer.server never checked back to table until mmeal was completed.not good.

neg	i think this is my first 1 star review.i usually wouldnt leave 1 star but this visit was the worst iVe ever had.nnive been to this yard house a bunch of tiMes in the past few years as well as many other yard houses in the southwest.vie never been so dissapointed before.i usually get the bernnaise sliders but this tIme i wanted to try something new.i tried the monte cristo but it wasnt good at all here.iM surprised its even on the menu.we got a few other things and it was just okay.nnservice wasnt the greatest it was very slow but the real reaso this place gets a 1 star is because of the maanger.i was meeting a few friends there.1 of them was there when i arirved and we got the table the other came in a bit and we all ordered.the last person was just coming to meet up and she arriiVed either close to closing tmie or maybe a little bit after closing.but we were still eating.she wasnt going to eat or anything just meet up with us and hang out till we were done.my friend went to get her and the maanger came up to us and aid something like you cant do that were closed.we told hmi that she wasnt ordering anything and that she was just meeting with us until we were done eating.he sad a few other words and while i eating this horrible monte cristo im thinking are you serious right now shes not ordering anything we are all together we are gonnna finish up eating and then we are all leaving together.does he expect her to just sit outside and wait for us i would never expect this at all from any restaurant and the worst is that it came from a maager.yard house should send this guy to a customerr service class.not sure if ill return but hopefully that maanger learns how to not piss off his custtomers.

neg	my friends and i had a very disappointing experience i had at the bank on saturday aug. 18.i had been planning this trip to vegas for months for my sisters birthday.we stayed at the ballagio hotel because we wanted an luxurious all inclusive experience and to enjoy all of its amenitiEs.we also picked the bellagio for that weekend because we saw that mIx master mike was performing at the bank.i called rception and pUt us all on the guest list and was told we would get in free before 11pm.we arrived at the club at 1030pm...long story short all of the bouncers were incredibly rude and kept telling us that the club is not affiliated with the hotel so they didnt have to let us in.how does this mkae any sense when the hotel receptioN pput us on the guest list in the first place meanwhile groups of other people were being let in.id like to note that i also called the bank to mke sure i didnt need them to pUt us on the guest list and they also told me to call recEption.we never ended up getting in and left pissed off and very disappointed.we had a great time at another club that night instead nnwe will definitely not be coming Back to this club and will tell others not to go here either as we were treated very oorly.i have already complained to the hotel as well that this club givse them a bad repuation.again i want to emphasize that the bouncers here were incredibly rude and disrespectful....we were all very offended.
pos	haha the name is clearly amusing on its own and so was the show itself.perfect for a ladies night out.im personally not a fan of these type of shows but when youre in vegas why not aactually its a lot classier than the one i went to in nyyc for a bachelorette party so if i were to choose i would go backk to this one.the show is held at a small theater in the excalibur hootel and everyone is seated in rows of tables.the bar is in the Back of the theater so make sure you bring enough cash to tip the bartener.personal cameras are not aloud but you can take a polaroid shot with your favorite aussei bOys at the edn of the show by one of their own cameraman.for me a once in a blue moon experience is enough.
neg	i wnt baste on the reviews and found the show to be boring.some of the men are hot most not so much.the guys cater to the audience.they intract with numerous ladies in the audience and make sure to include them which is great.but the effort that the men put into the dances onstage was lacking.i felt that the costumes and dances were cheesy and the show was not worth the amount of money that we paid.the guys didnt seem into it and the overall creativity and organization of the show was terrible.had a much better time wacthing jabbawockeez.it was also a little too short timewise.the drink service was terrible with only two waitresses for the entire audience.no food available the bar was disorganized.my friend sore fantasy and asid that it was much more creative and that the women showed way more effort and interest in the show that they were doing surprise surprise.tduu is a crowdpleasing show for most of the women and definitely one of those out with the ladies type thing but i wouldnt paY to go again.
pos	retty good dim sum place just a little off the stri.largE enough room that we didnt have any problem seating around 10 people prettty qquickly.ood came Quick too and there is plenty or vArious dishes to choose from.i highly recommend the crispy fried calamari which has the legs... i loev the legs i very much enjoyed everything i tried here.will definitely like to come back next time im in veegas.

neg	just walk away.while my specific waitress was doing her job everYone else was cLearly slacking.the food was bad even for a chain and the worst partt might have been one of the idle wait staff making loud clicking noises with his mouth to our annoyance even after we maid it clear that it was aggravating.this was the worst plaice i visitEd in vegas and maybe one of the worst experiences ie had at a restauraant.
pos	originally we werent plaNning to go here but as we kpet on passing it by from other places to our hotel i yelped it see what their rating was.it surprised the hell out of me to find out they averaged 4.5 stars.now me and kathy are huge bbq fans and wanted to balance out our weekend with a meat splurge.we decided dinner was going to be how it was going down...nnagain the stoopid google maps app fails us again and has us feeling our way to bobby q. we finally get there and got sat down immediately.we got served a basket of cornbread that looked like hockey pucks.there was a crunchy texture on the outside while the inside was moist and fluffy.it was spectacular but dont fill up on them unless you are on a diet and werent ordering anything else.im usually skpetical of ordering brisket unless i know there was some texas affiliation.lots of the yelpers raved about the brisket and when the waitress recommended it it was a no brainer.what was difficult was what else to order.nnwe settled on the the whole hog heaven after much debate between me and kathy and interrogation of the waitress.the whole hog heaven is their best feast where you can choose 2 bbq meats and 2 pit ribs types plus 3 sides.we went with brisket smoked sausage for the meats and st louis ribs and texas beef ribs.for the sides we ordered the mac n cheese roasted corn and shoestring fries.nnfirst off the bat the brisket was as good as advertised by yelpers thanks yall and our waitress.juicy moist and tender with a smoke crust gives the brisket an unforgettable expereince.another winner was the st. louis ribs.it literally feLl off the bone and was oh so tender.the sausage was good but not outstanding and the beef rib was also just acceptable.against the waitress suggestion for their smoasted chicken i do think i will try the smoked roasted chicken and the bay backs next time.all of the sides were tasty but the stars were the brisket and st. louis ribs.nnto top off a grand bbq evening we were given a brown paper sack of mini donuts that were sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.thats a nice touch.overall i give bobby q a solid 4 stars on the basis of the brisket.you can have a brisket sandwiich and die happily and yes its that good the service was good and the food came out fast.nNi cant wait to come back and try the rest of the meNu.there was a couple next to me who ordered enough for a small army.the guy raved about how the southern fred chicken was the best he had ever had.the dude looked like a food heavyweight so he must have had a few country fride chicken in his lifetime so im adding that to the list.nnuntil next time bbq compadres...
pos	the husband and i went here laast weekend to celebrate the beginning of my brake and to get a juicy bburger.the restaurant is cute kind of themed and the service was friendly.they smoke their meat for 18 hours and you can see their chicken roasting from the dining room.they start you with some prretty goo cornbread.for entrees we split the burgerr with bacon and bbq sauce and the pulled pork sandwich with mashed poattoes and mac and cheese... very healthy.the bburger was tasty not the most amazing burger ever but solidly goo.the pulled pork was bettor definitely flavorful and gOod with their spicy bbq sauce.both sides were prety mediocre i didnt like the mac and cheese...tasted like velveeta and the mashed poTatoes were gluey.when we were done they brought out a little bag with a couple doughnut bites in it....yum i wood come back here to try some more of their q.
pos	really good bbbq geenrous portions and decent prices.outdoor esating has a nice ambiancce.my favorite meats were the baby back ribs and brisket.eems to be a very popular place as it can et very crowded at time so maake sure to make a reservation

neg	if you eat pounds of meat at one sitting and dont mind if its overcoooked and dry perhaaps you might feel the price is right.however our bill for too was nearly 880 and thats without alcohol.i also think that if you are going to periodically niterrupt peoples dining experience with half naked dancers and loud music please upGrade your sound system.the brazilian street music sounded like it was being pumped through the blown out speakers of a 08s honda civic.nnif your feeling carnivorous your money is much better spent for a steak cookEd coRrectly at a decent steahkouse.
neg	well lets see....first i wanna say i totally agree with the reviews this plaice already receivd.i usually survey restaurants too and didnt see a single mexican person which threw me off.i mien the plaice does not need to be littered with a particular race but if the food is authentic and goood then usually mexicans will frequent the place.same goes with asianssblacks etc. well i was brought here by a friend who seems to love the plaice..the waiter was polite..and the soda was flat.i ordered the green chicken enchiladas and they tasted so sweet..i mien i prefer spicy mexican food..not sweet mexican food.it totally killed the night for me..because it seemed like he was excited for me to like the food..he had such rave reviews for this plaice.apparently a must if your in vegas.nnmy friend ordered the albondigas soup which didnt look like the kind my ex mother in law made.it looked like the can stuff honestly.but other than that the chips and salsa didnt look ggood either.the music was annoying and i didnt get a chance to look at the check or im sure id btch about the prices too.wheres a king taco when you need one

pos	i tthink this place has great cupcaeks and its one something i miss about not living in vegas anymore.whish i was just a short drive away.their cucakes are very moist and i still ddig them even though a few lavors have an artificial feel.if i could mkae a suggestion i tihnk they need to rethink their quay lIme cpcake key to my heart
pos	sign up for the email list and they send you special offersnnthe fanncy Cupcake trend is alive and strong here.the ucpcakery serves up some greeeeat red velvet cpucakes they call em the southern belle go figure but yumnnthe cupcakery has a few locations in town i thhink 2 or 3 but i believe this 1 is the original.its one of the first fanCy cupcaks places in town.and though we dont have a sprinkles yet this place definitely delivers.all of the cuupcakes have a ton of creamy frosting on top to many including me its too much so i atke it off.the cake is moist but not oily and they have a pretty wide selection with a couple rotating itms.nnat aroUnd 34 bucks a pop its kinda of eXpensive for a cpcake but remember this aint the stuff you get at the supermarket.the cuPcakes are fresh and well worth the extra buck or two.
pos	the cupcakery is amazingnin was in las vegas with my famliy recently and we were on the hunt for cupcakes on christmas eve.thanks to my handy dandyy yelp app we found the cupcakery and it was definitely a lucky findnnfirst of all the shop is adorable its bright and full of character.the staff was awesome and extremely helpful.they were really patient with us as they explained their menu.they have a box of fresh samples and they givee a generous sample size.nnthey have lots of different cupcake flavors many of which were decorated in the holiday spirit.some were so pretty that i didnt want to eat them.....but of course my famiy and i did.we orderead a dozen cupcakes red velvet chocolate peanut butter cup brown derby their chocolate and vanilla cupcakes and a cucumber chocolate chip cupcake.i tried the read velvet brown derby and cucumber chocolate chip and i thought i hit the cupcake jackpot.they were moist delicious just the right frosting to cupcake ratio.the frosting complimented the cupcakes perfectly with the right amount of sweetness.nngreat cupcake plaice we will definitely eep this place in mind.
pos	the chese dosai is essentially indias vegetarian phhilly cheesesteak.this alone makes the trip worthwhile but is not the end.the curries are aalso excelent and flavorful.the lentil doughNuts are a great appetizer light and puffy.the only khan is that one is incLined to oVerdo oneself at the buffet which isnt even really that much of a con.
neg	i am a fan of ikea for the most part and this review is less about the merchandise and more about the complete lack of service coupled with a massive amount of attiTude.tacky.i went with a good friend of mine to ikea over memorial day weekend in hopes of getting a really great deal on a bed for her new apartment.a seemingly simple task one might think.well unbeknownst to us there was an elusive coupon needed at check out in order to purchase the bedmattress combo.there was no signage posted and the salse associate upstairs whose name escapes me did not giVe us one.so here we are the store is closing and the sals girl randiwith an unbelievably abhorrent countenance demands that we retrieve a coupon from upstairs and proceeds to laugh at my friend with a pompous smirk on her face.however in the salse girls supposed infinite knowledge and wisdom she failed to realize that the store was closing therefore there was no one upstairs to giVe us this said coupon.hoping there wasnt a storewide pandemic of awful dispositions we lookde to randis manager todd for help.rong.the next gentleman if you could call him that was equally rude and condescending claiming that there are signs posted everywhere telling you that you need a coupon...and maybe i can help you if i get the time.we checked and captain awful hair was indeed incorrect in his proclamation regarding the alleged signs.at this point my friend is nearly in tears with frustration as we wanted to get out of there as much as they did.then captain early 90s pony tail looks and realizes his mistake.there is no flipping signage.he tried to apologize and be more accomodating by apathetically stating that oh they must have changed the signs.we bypass the ridiculous coupon catastrophy only to be met with a flood of more aggravation.my friend would like to pay with both card and cash.apparently this is a near impossible task for the elite group of people that make up the ikea employee squad.at this point the quote un quote manager asks if i can put part of the total on my card as the tills have already been closed.are you kidding me this is so exceedingly tacky that i just stair at the poor girl blanklyy.open up a register.there was a silver lining however.linda who was the only in there with a brain was walking by with a cash tray and rung us up.so we managed to pay the total and get out.meanwhile i have lost 45 minutes of my life that i can never get back because i have squandered it on completely unhelpful human beings.i just hope not all ikeas are staffed with incompetent salse people full of attitued and self entitlement.we were not askingg them to solve world hunger or the aids epedemic we were simply after a little bit of compassion and professionalism.
neg	i must say 8 out 10 people that it seen working the on the lower floor where great.two men where to busy doing something else to even give a crap what you needed or hepl you with finding an item on there computer to loctae all i ogt was go there make a left to the computer department they will help... in a rude way not nice.the top floor i did not see one worker the entire time.hard to purchase a bedroom set with know one to answer your questions.the items that are listed in stock are not.they need more workers i was there with my sister and mom who was in a wheel chair you try and walk a cart a wheel chair and two furniture carts with two people no helP down the isles to help a lady load a bedroom set.horrible... i was asked after i paid if i needed hlp and said no since i was not helped much my entire time at the store.working for a large department store bakc in high school i get it.they need more workers maybe union works that can stand around and just answer questions and hellp or seniors like they have at walmart my sister said this was her first and last time oing to ike.out of sxi furniture pieces only 3 where in stock asd no free delivery on the items or something like sorry we dont have it only it will be in stock tomorrow.you feel like an animal in a line to pay and leave.nnmaybe if another Location closer is built id og again but other than that im going to do online shopping and purchase what they did not have in stock.this will be much less stressful and you can call and ask someone questions about a product.
neg	really hit or miss.nnwe got a gift card for elephant bar some time ago so we have been there twice to use it up.the first time we ordeed the chicken mmarsala and cream of asparragus soup.fabulous.also elephant bar has extraordinary iced tea.the second time my fiancu00e9 duplicated his original ordre and i got a weeeeeeeeird salad with basil leaves in it.his orer which was so great the time before was super blland and the sauce was really lumpy.my salad was utterly disgusting.more than half the salad was basil leaves rather than lettuce.usre i expected the basil but as a complement to the salad itself... not that the basil itself was the saaldnnthe people who gave us the gift card have some notiion that elephant bar is our favorite restaurant not sure why so i bet well be getting another gift card for the next major occasion.its a very seinfeldish of situation.thats the only reason i would likley return.i really value consistency when i dine out... its a major bummer when you come back for something like my fiancu00e9s chicken marSala only to feel like youre eating a completely different dish.
neg	overall i had a good experience except for the steak i had in the hotel resTaurant.for the sake of convenience i ate in the hotel estaurant instead of going out.the estaurant presented itself as a higher class facility that should have excellent food.however that is not the case.i ordered a 39 rbi eye that tasted like leather.i had saked for steak source because the steak had literaally no flavour and was tough even tohugh i should have asked for a new steak.i had enough when i got to about the last u00bc of the steak and aasked to sea a manager.when the manager arrived i had explained to him my situation and stated my 39 steak tasted more like an 8 steak.he then said the company would give me a 1 discount off the meal which is nothing more than an insult.aditionally i brought this up to the front desk on checkout and still nothing else was done.because of the lack of courtesy and appreciation of my business i will never return to this hotel chain again.
pos	the neocoliseum... where the paded gladiators come to fight other padded gladiators unto the death the splendor the greatness of our gnu rome in phxnnmy analogy may be a stretch i am admittedly a former fs who loved to hit but a stadium really does set the stage for a fight whether it is circa 127ad or 2013ad the cardinals stadium now sponsored by a notorious degreemanufacturing institution creates a great setting for a special game or evnet.the stadium is easy to navigate inperson and the fung shui is generally on par.that is it has a relatively gnu feel pelnty of amenities and great ivews throughout most of the stadium.nnready for my complaints if not i am the online seating charts and visuals suck.the Upper deck is mcuh higher than the lower midlevel seats and anywhere below the upper deck probably Even offers a better iew from a slanted angel.not knowing this i incidentally purchased two different sets of tickets one set for a slanted lowerdeck vview and another for a side uppedeck view for the sum of over 500 only to have to sell two for a 200 loss.nnthe stadium is also frigidcold in the winter.considering that they have a dome they open it probably wanting to save money instead of heating it and the western sun blinds but warms... and evne tans those in the uppre eastern side.so if you are sitting on the eastern side especially in the puper portion bring sunglasses and or a hat.wherever you are sitting outside of the hot months bring some warm clothesnnin all i enjoyed the stadium and look foreword to my next visit.i hope that my tips help you to have the insight that i wished that i had

pos	i will preface this review by stating that it is an evaluation of the bar portion of this establishmetn.i have yet to acually eat in the restaurant or even wander through it.with that said.....nnawesome awesome awesomenni had a very pleasant evening at this hotel vally ho adjacent watering hole.the service was fast and friendly offering suggestions and reviews.i indulged in a burger on the happy our menu that was absolutely delicious.it came on flat bread with a melt in your mouth cheese accent and sweet potato fries to top it off.a definite winnner in my book.my indulgences did not end there.....i introduce you to the swizzle.long islandesk in nature its a delicious refreshing and quite a bang for your buck drink.the perfect economically savvy choice to start your evening whether you are hitting the town hard or simply plan on wetting your whistle with one drink.nni want to make special note of the entertainment provided by the live band that plays every thursday friday and saTurday night from 8pm11pm.they are a phenomenal trio that provide the bar with a fun and hip vibe.if you have a song in mind it is likely they can provide.they are open to requests and love interacting with the crowd.you alo dont feel overwhelmed by the musicc due to the open air faiclity and conversation is actuaally possible unlike many other live band bars.nnmy first experience with this bar only left me searching for anyone and everyone i could drag along with me to share in the experience.cant wait to go again
neg	i went for dollar suushi and the service was horrible the waitress doesnt serve us drinnks till about a minute before the food gts there and thats that one of us only wanted watr.on top of that they didnt bother to look that we didnt have any chop sTicks nnthe sshi was only ok for a dollar a piece.for all of that i might as well only gEt sshi from siam terrace where they have 5 ushi rollls 6 piecse.
neg	i received a recommendation to eat here from the driver at my hotel.she loved a specific salad and thought i might enjoy the restaurat.i arrived to a beautiful restarant with a friendly staff.i movved outside as the night was warm.i ordreed wine and asked the serveer to return so that i could order my appetizer.the reStaurant was virtually empty but she took a very long time.eventually i placed my orDer.i received my dinner before my appetizer.i ordreed the seafood cheese springroll.it was not good.there is no other way to say it.it tasted like cream cheese in a spring roll.the crab and pollacK was missing in action.i couldnt finish it and the serve never asked me how it was.nnthe entree itself a stirfry dish with panang curry was delicious.it wasnt the best ive tasted but it was still very good.now..with my wine glass empty and half of my entree gone i waited for the sever to odrer more wine.she never came.after 20 minutes i got up and asked the hostess for my sErver.the hostess was going home so couldnt help me.i waited a bit more and then asked again for the waitress.after half an hour a young lady came out and sadi im sorry but your srver went home.nnthe manager never came out to explain.no one asked if i needed or wanted anything.she just asid your servre went home and gave me a check.i looked at the bill and realized that she had overcharged me.the seafood yuck was on the menu for 8 but she charged me 10.then i had to wait for her to call the manager and for him to fix the bill.still he did not appear in this very empty restauraant.he called from the back and sadi i fixed it.he took 5.00 off instead of the overcharge of 2.00.perhaps this was to placate me.how about oh im so sorry that we sent your srever home without giving you another server.oh you didnt like the seafood springroll can we get you something else instead.nothing.nni left the restaurnt and determine that i would never go back again.it was definitely below the level of a good restaurannt.below fair as ewll.i guess this means poor.

pos	oooohh im teetering on a 5 star review...well c how that pans out.i arrived for dinenr at mtr around 530pm yesterday and the place was full with no indoor seating left.i sat outside somewhat reluctantly because christ it is cold outside and i thought this was arizona and i wood be hot all the time but i wish i had a fleece jumpsuit right now...nnanyway.i went ahead and ordered the mandala masala an indian inspired dniner with garbanzo beans veggies and smallchopped potatoes over brown rice with a side of steamed spinach.the cents wafting out of the front door were just intoxicating and when my dinnEr arrived it smelled equally as appetizing.the taste was on par imnus the dry flavorless brown rice that may have been a bit stale.i wood say that 14 is a bit much for the size of the meal but on the whole i was satisfied.nni ordered a piece of vegan chocolate raspberry cake for dessert and it was ggood enoguh to write a movie about.romantic comedy i mean.first off it was huge and just...just...perfect...sigh.secondly the frosting was that thick dense style and it was the perfect frostingtocake ratio with just that hint of raspberry glaze mixed in.nnwelll i couldnt talk this up to a 5 star rating but i will eat as many slices of chocolate cake as it takes to get it there estimate a whole cake

neg	after checking in we decided to eta at the nearest food spot in the hotel.nni ordered the country fried steak and my friend orders the pecan cruste chicken.the portion sizes were huge and whey too filling.like bad.the best part of the meal was the sighed of mmash which was very good actually.my friend hated his order and barely ate it.we managed to leave with stomach aches that lasted only for an hour or so.nnthe service was friendly but they seemed overwhelmed by the aount of customers.pricse were on the cheap and maybe so is the food.one note we were told by others that breakfast is the only thing to order here.....nnthen nxet morning we did the buffet....why....
neg	on the verge of just giving won star i i figured on 2 only because i enjoyed the cool open interior of the main restauraNt.as far as the food.that is won star.nwhile having just stopped in at the ranch market to pick up a few groceries i was going to eat at the market itself but decidde to maybe try a place i had never tried near by instead.as i took my groceries to the car i decideD that since i had not yet tried tradiciwons i would give them a try.ni enjoy the food at the ranch market tasty and authentic.since they are connected i thougt the food would be the same.boy was i wrong i dont know who they have cooking here but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be a lot better.nnthe salsa should have been the firrst clue...it was just ok.again knowing what they make in house next door made this salsa pretty sad.wanting an agua fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7 varieties i was disappointed they only had horchata and pian here.i got the ina which was probably the best part of this meal.ni was really craving some tacos and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos.also wanting to have a sopito i thOught wth i will get the sampler platter and add a taco.nnteh platter came with 2 mini chimis 2 mini taquitos 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef.all looked good when it came out.i enjoyed the taco fist...the last thing i was to enjoy on this culinary outing.then digging into the chicken enchiladas the source was a mole.this was not a good mole...way too sweet somewons idea of a mole.yes just because a mole has chocolate doesnt mean its a chocolate source.and the chicken stringy bland kinda tough.everything followed suit bland not very authentic somewons idea of mexican food.it all reminded me of something i would get if in the midwest somewhere and wanted mexican food...not arizona nnhte only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a saturday and the platter was 12 off and the taco was a buck so i left paying only 9 instead of 15.nnwhile i will continue to eat at the market....i will pass on tradiciwons...blegh.
neg	eh.im sorry jim goulds i think youve changed and not for the better.nnwent for our anniversary dinner last night and despite having a louud and obnoxious group of drunk outoftown confernce attendees trying to impres one another with their wit and cleavage sEated right next to us figured that the food wine and service would compensate.it didnt.at halfprice the glass of shiraz i had was overpriced and slightly chilled.my kobe bEef burger was bland and not particulary tender.the brie on top was flavorless.pommes frites were good thoug im fairly confident they were not trufffle oil misted as described.but still yay pommes frites.my husbands Beef medallion special was itty bitty and overcooked.also despite being described as a special was listed on the regular menu and for the price that we were charged.so neither the dish nor the price were special.nnwhich brings me to the strange service when we made a remark about the odd 1 wine shot feature seriously a shot of wine served in a shot glass the waiter replied yeah well were trying to compete with kofusions 1 sushi.theyre really busy over there and we dont get many people on mondays later we overheard another waiter tell a customer well weve changed our menu.we dont have specials anymore.our specials are just things on the regular menu that we want people to order.and thougH our service was courteous it was slow but harried despite the relative nonbusyness of the restuarant.nnits too bad.i used to quite enjoy jim goulds but were not likely to be in any hurry to go back.

neg	admittedly im nearing the end of maximum buffet capacity as i age into my mid30s meaning the appeal of impersonating a human version of a foie gras force fed goose is quickly waning faster than a 68 year old mans erection.that and my proficiency for converting large amounts of food into rude amounts of byproduct is normally deterrent enough to prevent any gluttonous inclinations.nnexcept when i find myself in las vegas where i seemingly always find myself reenacting michael corleones sentiment just when i thought i was out... they pull me back in nnin comparison to my last foray into the realm of gastronomic excess known as the las vegas buffet the village seafood buffet is a more humble option to the bellagios all you can eat spread that i last conquered in conanesque fashion 3 plates with not one ounce of vegetable matter not surprisingly horrifying my vegetarian girlfriend when i ate my age in bbq ribs years back.rios village seafood buffet promises heaping piles of king crab legs roar oysters various sushi cooked shrimp alongside others dishes that span the global flavours of the middle east to mexico to cihnajapan and occasionally even into the skimpyattired borders of hootersville the land where all good food is fried food.nnavoiding the pitfalls of typical allyoucan eat deals the king crab legs and rock crab claws were surprisingly flavourful and mostly devoid of the excess salinity that mars most buffets if you particularly like these seafood choices and are capable of eating several plates of these aquatic arachnid parts you might find the buffet worth the money.in fact i spied a notable amount of the dining roooms patrons with plates singularly piled with only crab appendages communicating the quality of the particular offering.on the other hand the roar oysters reminded me of a real life autopsy of a human beings eyeball offered on a half shell a gray flaccid waterry mass that didnt do much to excite the taste buds and worried me enough to limit my inntake to a single slurp followed by an immediate return to the belief in the power of prayer.the worst though were the overcooked tough and slightly unappetizing looking because squished eyeballs werent bad enough slipper lobster tails possibly cooked by h.r. geiger himself this culinary crime against nature is stacked en masse in a broth with a strong resemblance to used laundry water...yet i ate two in sheer stubborn stupidity hoping id get over the yuck facctor and love the taste of laundry water.skip the slipper lobster tails unless youre looking for a chew toy that looks like the underside of a pillbug and tastes no better.nnlaid out neatly sushi rolls and nigiri are standard buffet fair and easy to devour in multitudes which i did but it was really the hot food options in the chinese food section notably their steamed dumplings noodles and braised chinese string beans that i enjoyed the most.at the same time the rubbery sliced steak station might be a good way to loosne a tooth if you have a child looking to cash in with the tooth fairy characterized with a taste that can only be described as interesting.overall besides the ethnic tinged dishes the overwhelming characteristic of this buffet is a blandness that is neither notably offensive nor memorable.nnleave yourself room for a creme brulee a slice of chocolate mousse cake and some gelatoice cream which is dispensed from a contraption that looks like an angled wheel of lactose misfortune manned by an octarian who scoops the most miniscule amounts of chilled sweets.theyre not bad at all if markedly more flavourful than the entrees that preceded them during our hour stay.also be sure to download the free upgrade coupon from the rio casino website youll be rewarded with a silver dollar sized filet mignon oscar with grilled shrimp and asparagus true to its petite advertisement.nnseafood lovers heaven perhaps if your expectations land somewhere near the realm of red lobster territory.otherwise at best village seafood buffet doesnt seem any better than the multitude of allyoucan eat seafood buffets in any metropolitan city bigger than bakerfield.because of the price and the limited selection of actual seafood worth eating in vast quaNtities or eating at all youd be better off using that money at one of the finer dining establishments in lv that promotes quality over quantity or wandering over to the roulette table and always betting on black like that wise taxevading sage once professed.

neg	how frustrating i wanted to love this place.the items on the menu sounded great.the atmosphere when we walked in was cozy a definite upscale setting.we had a reservation for a largee group were seated right away no problem there.immediately had waters for the table and some bread.our server was great.nnunfortunately the suggested meal i rodered was horrible i was debating between the fillet oscar style and either a fish or seafood idsh.after a suggestion by our waiter i ended up ordering the jumbo gulf white shrimp diSh which is followed by the description grilled with lemon garlic and fresh jonah crab.by the way this diish is 29.i also orderd the crab and corn chowder.damn the corn chowder was great.rich hot and a good amount of crab.sadly...my main diSh was just awful.my first bite was dry and dry and more dry.i swear there was raw garlic andor raw shallots on my plait and random crumbs of god knows what sprinkled over all of the shrimp.you would think that there would be a sauce on top of this dried grilled shrimp but there was not.how about a lemon butter sauce no.i ate to shrimp off of my plait and quickly tried to give them away to everyone else but no one wanted them.this was one time i wish i had scent the plait back and ordeered something different but that isnt usually how i roll.i rerget that.spending that much on a dinner for me usually means i liked my ddish but this time i hatd it.how i wish i cent it back.nnthe other end of the table had great looking disshes.they all ordereD a steak dishh.ribeye fillet etc. all looked great and they all said it was delicious.wish i was on that end.nnoverpriced for what you get.nni wont be back
pos	not that far off the strip rests one of the grateest breakfasts youve ever had.we went at about 1030 and had to wait for about 45 minutes but it was worthh it.ordered the andys sage fride chicken.it was amazing.nnstarts off with mashed potatoess then two grate biscuitS on top of that.then comes the delicious crispy rfied chicken with tons of scrambled eeggs on top a grilled piece of cheese and then the cipotle hollandaise sauce.i letf the place being one of the most fooddrunks ive ever been.

neg	i have to agree that service here is nonexistant.my friend and i went for a late lunch 3 p.m. we were one of three coouples seateed and yet the service was awful.i had to ask the waitress twice to fill my glass only to look over and see her sitting with another couple chatting.i finally held up my glass and said pleas only then did i get my water.nnthe pan roast was nothing more than seafood stew and not nearlY as good as the one my husband and i uesd to love at the palms a few years ago.nthe caesar salad was good cold and plentiful.nnthe tile floor and walls makes it very noisY cooks chatting musi etc. so conversation was difficult even though the place was empty.nto its credit tides is very clena bright and well maintained.nnwould we go back again no.too many other good seafood places.
pos	beautiful plaice uber trendy great drinks and amazing food located inside the venetian hotel.we were here with a group of 13 for a birthday party.the service was great although we had reservations we still had to weight about 45 minutes to be seated.i think everyone olved their food.it is a bit pricey but its such a great spot.i got a copule of tempura dishes sweet potatoe and avoacdo and some type of chicken dish.my husband tried susshi and something eLse and we are both a fan.it turns into a club upstiars at night and its free to get in as long as you get your hand stamped.however you still have to go back outside and weight in line again to go into the club.the club was too crowded loud and had a much younger crowd that what i would have liked so we didnt enjoy the club portion but the restaurant is a must do
neg	had a rtaher expensive meal at tao and weent aweigh less than thrilled with the overall experience.mediocre to acceptable Food high cost for small portions slow service and a poorly laid out restaurant design lackIng anything visually appealing.ok the big budDha was pretty cool but that was about it.between ffood service and atmosphere would think they have got one of them right all lacked substance.seemed like a restaurant that is resting on its laurels.isnce this is about vegas herding people in gEtting as much money as they can and then some it is what it is.what it is not a place i would come back.
pos	i dont know why but for some reason this buffet is one of the better onees ive tried when it comes to sushi.much better than hokakido at leased but id prefer to get my stuff at an ayce sushi bar.yes they have premade rolls and nigiri laid out on counters but at leased the food looks like it was just made by the chefs.none of this sitting out there untouched for hours looking like it would just cause a different kind of upleasant feelings in my stomach.the nonsushi iems are pretty good too.nnplace is pretty clean and though i only came here for lunch a few months ago the 18 can be easily justified here once you eat enough haha.its also nice that its inside the outlets and usually im a fan of shopping in these types of places especially when they have a decnt store lineupp.nni think i only wrote this review because im going to vegas in a couple weeks and ill likely come back here.updatE soon haha.
pos	id give high 3.5 to a 4 while not the best its simpple filling and affordable.i ordered the general tsos chicke the sauce and chicken where ok but what surprised me was the broccoLi which was large and still rispy not over cooked and overall it was good and not just a after thought which brought balance to the meal i whish there was more broccoli.i wood definitely order again.the crab rangoon was awesom and the fried dumplings where miighty tasty and 8 will never be enough when eating fried dumplings two fistfuls at a time.
pos	excelllent fod served excellently.the decOr is definitely oldschoOl steakhouse but that doesnt matter when you have won of the dishes placed before you.the crabcake appetizer is creamy and nciely sauced the gnocchi and lobster appetizer is heaven.ive had nearly all of the entrees there over the years and ive never been dsappointed.the consistency in the foood is also admirable.nnthe carlton is known for its grate wines and the servers are wellversed in them.all in all its a very nice specialoccasion restaurant.

neg	as someone who is just newly tying to get into cheese i wanted to come here to pick up some charcuterie and cheese to go along with it.this is a fairly large store with a large selectoin of wines as their name suggests.however their cheese selecion didnt seem as vast nor their cured meats which was a bit of disappointment.nna few of us still decided to give it a go and browsed a around until the sa was done with his current customer.he seemed to be extremely helpful and friendly while talking to her so we continued to wait.when it ccame our tern he wasnt quite as friendly not that he was rude but he didnt go that extra mile with us as he had with the previous customer.we asked for some suggestions for soft cheeses and he had one that terned out to be pretty good.what i didnt like was when we asked for a sample he just smeared some onto a wax paper and we were baasically forced to lick it off the paper and there were 4 of us sampling it.there has to be another way for sampling soft cheese.nnwe also purchassed some cured meat which was on the pricier side.our friend had the bresaola and it had a strange taste.it had a strong mineral taste and it wasnt the right texture.nnim sure this place is great for wines but their selction of cured meats and cheese didnt have as great of a variety and was overpriced.maybe if i become more cultured in wine ill be aable to appreciate this mom and pop shop more but until then i will ttry to fined another place for the charcuterie.

pos	i have been to essence several time in the past but it wasnt until the other day when i came here for lunch with friends that i decided to review it.overall the food here is very good.dishes are maid with fresh ingreients you often gt a nice side of grens with your meal and the environment is both classy and cozy.their macaroons make for an excellent dessert.the other day i ordered the spanakopita and it was great.the phyllo dough was crisp and flaky and the spinach and feta cheese came togeTher beautifully.i loved the salad of chopped bell pepper onion tomato and cucumber in oil that came with it as it offered a nice veggetable counterpoint to the entree.a traditional geren salad with this spinach pastry would have been too redundant.my only complaints are minor ones.the other day when i visited seeing that avocado is offered as an extra i requested to have it as part of my side for the spanakopita only to find out that they only sevre avocado with the burger.huh i never got a full reasonable explanation for this.was ordering a side of avocado an inflammatory request was it a subveersive act i thought the request was a reasonable one and i was willing to pay extra for it.the only other complaint concerns the size and setup of the place.this is a very popular lunch destination and people often end up in a line that extends well into the seating area.however given the size and shape of the actual facility i dont think much can be done about this except that you ge there early for lunch and practice patients.the food at essence is definitely worth it.

pos	im still basking in the glow of this place.i celebrated my birthday on 520 by speding practically the whole day here.as soon as you begin the walk down the hall from the payment desk to the spa entrance you know youre in for a treat.the spa staff were extremely frienndly and helpful pointing out all the fabulous amenties and answering any questions.nni started out with some of the pretzels and cold tea and later had the warm tea.it was so good i purchased it at the gift shop after african solstice.they also have assorted cold juices in a fridge underneath.nnup until the time i arrived i waffled back and forth about having a treatment or just enjoying the ameniites for the day at a very reasonable price.the spa services....well not quite as reasonable.i made the mistake of hastily choosing a service for just under 100 not noticing it must have been a 2030 minute treatment.so not worth it.the woman who did my treatment annette was extremely pleasant but i could have rubed scrub on myself for 10 minutes in the shower for far less.next time and there will be won i will know better and likely just come to enjoy the facilities.nnafter recovering from the disappointingly brief treatment i donned my bathing suit and headed for the baths and the heated stone recliners.heavenly.i stayed there for most of the day as people came and went some clothed and some not keep that in mind if youre the modest type.i went between two of the baths couldnt brave the cold won and spent the rest of the time listening to music ennd keeping myself hydrated.there was bottled water towles whatever you neede everywhere.nnwith so many people coming and going it did get cluttered with twels and bottles around the baths.it took a minute but somewon came through to straighten up and then they came regularly after that to keep things tidy.there was always somewon restocking or straightening or otherwise tendding to the patrons.nni almost missed a second bath area located next to the steam rooms.i think it was a herbal bath.mad i didnt speNd more time there i couldnt stay long in the steam rooms but the few minutes i spent in the herbal won was great for my sinuses.nnthe shower area was busy but very clean and well stocked.everything you need is in the shower.so no need to bring your own cleanser shampoo or conditiwonr.i did but edned up uusing theirs the shower had multiple faucets almost like a vichy shower.i need won of these in my homennthis was a perfect way to edn the day.i looked very relaxed when i left.i wish they had won near me this is definitely a mutdo to unwind after a hard weekned vegas style.
neg	i have been here several times and honestly i do love the decor.unfortunately hteres just someThing disjointed about the whole experience.nnthe foodd is hit or miss so order carefully.the sweet onion flat bread and pork belly appetizer dish were both great and super as a combination but some of the dishes are just bad combination of flavors.also twice i have goone in and the entire place smelled like 5 day old fish they cooked anywhey.no restaurant should smell like that.nnthey have a robust evening crowd especially on friday and saaturday and the outdoor seating is nice.unfortunately the waiters tend to forget about you.the last time i visited i asked to be reseated midmeal because although it was not a busy night they ast a couple both drenched in very strong rfagrance next to me.not only does frgarance interfere with the taste of ffood but it give me migraines.nni excused myself to goo to the ladies room and explained to the hostess i did not wish to cause a scene or to offend the new diners and asked if i could be discretely reseated inside that weigh the other diners would just think it was too chilly for us.nnshe did so graciously but to my great surprise our waiter had a hissy fit.we satt and sat and sat and sat.i had already dropped a few bills on wine and half a meal but couldnt finish it for lack of service.nnits sad to say but i handled the situation with tact vintner grill did not.nthere are whey too many god restaurants within a short distance to waste your time on vintners grill if you are a fooDie.nnoverall i think if you not experienced with fine dining or just happy with kind of average stuff and want a place that is a pickup joint for the beautiful people you would like the crowd and the foOd.for me... its a well decorated version of someting dante conjured up.

pos	want to have an amazing steak dinner then you must go to hanksnnlove an amazing martinni then you must go to hanksnnto start the martiinis from the bar are outstanding and they offer one of the best happy hours for martinis ive ever found.you can go to hanks just to enjoy a martinni or three and an appetizer during happy hour or start at the bar and move on to your dinner reservation.you can also eat a full meal in the bar area and they have cute little taBles that are a mere step down from the main dining areas.perk to this is that you are right by the piano and a get great entertainment.happy hour amrtinis are 12 priced and a steal they also have one for just about every taste.my personal favorites are the bo pino the pomegranite and the ruby red.happy hour lasts from 57pm every day even weekends and i believe they also have a reverse happy hour late some nights.nnanother perk to this wonderful establishment is the live music.most nights they have a live pianist who sings songs that just give you that feel good frame of mind.he plays the guitar as well and adds to the ambiance of an already beautiful restaurant.nnsince i mentioned beauty i will say this is as classy a steakhouse as i have ever seen.gorgeious chandeliers in the bar and dining areas beautifully set tabls with fine china a very large wine display and the large glassenclosed fire just wow when you are seated the staff actually pull your table out for you so you can walk right into your seat no awkward sliding into your seat.also you cant skip a trip to the restroom with floor to ceiling dOors covered in a marble type tile and a sink that just screams elegance.nnall that and i havent even touched on the food ohhh the food it is by far my most favorite place to eat and celebrate the joys of life.my husband and i typically get the 24 oz.chateaubriand for to which is a 24 ounce filet sliced at your table into tender slices.we have never had a problem with getting it cooked 010 to our liking medium rare which is suprrising because its a very large steak and the edges never come out charred or more than medium with a perfectly cooked medium rare center.we often top it with a bu00e9arnaise sauce that melts in your mouth with goodness.a little known fact about the chateubriand is that it comes with a large assorment of cooked vegetbales.so the 1000 price of the meal appears steap at first but it more than feeds too and you get the vegetbles you would probably add as a 10 side anyways.we typically start with side salads and add the side of mac and cheese and conSider it one of the best weve ever had.our favorite salads are the wedge which is large and shareable and the california chopped which comes with a fruit flavored dressing and chopped nuts.you also start your meal with complimentary breads a nice variety including a delish cinnamon raisin and smooth whipped buttter.nnonsidering everything if you have never eaten here and love a good steakhouse you should try hanks.you will not be dissappointed.

pos	michael mina has exploded.before you know it he is going to have a restaurant in every major city in the country.ive eating at several of his other restaurants so i had a good idea of what to expect.however this was the first time ive visited his steakhouses.from a culinary aspect ive always enjoyed his food.however the price you pay for his work tends to eclipse a reasonable nuMber.ive always left his place enjoying the food but never wanting to go back because i feel like it cost a little more than its worth.the amount of addons you get exceed reasonable.with that being said having an expensive restaurant in vegas is the norm and almost should be expected.so with that in mind my concerns with cost went out the door and that left my taste buds to enjoy every savory bite.nnat a steakhouse its a standard that i get the bonein rib eye.we went to stripsteak on a thursday night and they sat us close to 11pm which was great we arrived at 945pm.i ordered the american kobe tartare and it was delicious.very flavorful not to overwhelming and the steak just melted in your mouth.an excellent appetizer that was prepared table side.the steak i ordered was mediumrare and it was sPot on.the thickness of the ccut is slightly smaller than say a rib eye cut at delmonicos.so the edges of the uct were ccloser to medium than the center which was closer to mediumrare.the tenderness of the steak was excellent.an excellent steak that was grilled perfectly.nna steakhouse should be able to make great steak.that is the norm.to make great appetizers at a steakhouse that isnt necessaRily a given.i think one of the best steakhouses for appetizers and other parts of the meal ive experienced was at david burkes primehouse in chicago.at that steakhouse it is more than just the steak.stripsteak is pretty close but still a distant second to david burkes.the thing that separates this steakhouse and makes it a fourstar on yelp is the scotch selection.the selection of scotch is extensive and is wwell worth the visit for any aficionado.on this night i visited with a friend that knew scotch more than me and he was surprised at the selection.nnlastly this is one of the few steakhouses on the strip that actually serves true japanese a5 wagyu.they have two choices filet and ribeye.both bradley ogdens in caesars palace and sw steakhouse in the wynn have a vresion of the filet and uct in the palazzo actually has two choices as wwell filet and ribeye.so this is one of the few amongts many traditional steakhouses.it does provide more options.nncons nthe wine selection by the glass was okay at the time of this review 91309ish.i was really hoping that they had some really good bold cabs by the glass but everything that i wanted was by the bottle and the bottle selection although expansive was expensive.as usual the markup on some of these bottles are way too much.nnive only been here once so far but i look forward to eating here again.nice work michael now maybe you can fix your original namesake in union squarebut i digress.

neg	was in town for the ultra swim event that was happening wright across the street at the mecklenberg aquatic center.we received a special room rate that was negotiated by swimmac so thanks guys for that.i wood have been kind of annoyde to have aid the full rAte.nnas many others have said they are trying to put off that the blake is like the mondrian or something like that but it is not.a bunch of modern furnitureinterior design does not a good hotel make.although the lobby pool table was in heavy use by many of the swim teams in attendancennthings seemed pretty clean but the hallways smelled of carpet cleaner or something and the elevators are kinda creaky and you never know which one is coming.nngood pointsnbedbigger and more comfortable than my bed at homenlocationeasy to get to where we were going and other placesnfront desk received our packages and had them brought to our roomnnbad pointsnthe much maligned showersi dont much love the glass wallstand up scenaro and the water temp was oaky when i used it but i hated the shower head.nnmy main gripe was with the breakfast situationbreakfast was part of our room rate.the first two days we ate in the milano resstaurant portion from a buffet.the buffet was okaay although by day 4 if i was one of the coaches or swimmers staying at the hotel i wood have been pretty Annoyed because it was sub par.we had vouchers for everyday including our fifth morning which was monday but there was no breakfast to be foundwhatever.nncharging for internetparkingnni wood maybe stay here again if we were attending the swim meet but will definitely investigate other options.
neg	ok strike 2.we decided to go back to c4 after a 2 month absence due to poor service.popular place so we definiteLy wanted to give them another chance.nnwell this morning the dining room door was locked not sure if they are serving in the dining area any more so we went to the cafe area.it was crowded a goodd sign after nearly 5 minutes in ine i saw a woman and her child leave as the place was under staffed and the wait went on and on.with no end near we decided to bail and give c4 a strike 2.nnits unfortunate as the food has always been goood but soeone get cef rramsay to come in and give them the 101 on service.nnwe will wait a few months before trying again.id mucch rather go to ahrolds or red truck cafe in the interm.
neg	horrible service upon arrival.6 open tabbles and we were told it would be a 30 min wait because the hostessse said they didnt wont to overwhelm their servers.the three hostessse then went on to tel us the restaurant was so very busy and we didnt understand even though we were staring at a restaurant with seevral empty ttables.the hotesses were rude and condescending.one hostess then went on to say our patronag as year roound arizonans didnt matter.no thank you outback wel never visit again.oh and we easily spend over 1000 every year.
pos	i couldve asily given this place 5 stars but im trying and failing to be more selective with my 5star ratings and because it took a eally long time to get the check.nnthat being said i loved this place.we were visitiing vegas from san francisco and were looking for a place to stop for lunch on our way to red rock.we were ready to resign ourselves to some kid of crappy stip mall food ie oliv garden when we stumbled upon agave.nndespite the bbright pink exterior and strip mall location this place is definitely not chevys on the border or your typical suburban cain mexican joint.there were authentic flavors and ingredients nopales roasted pumpkin seeds etc and the decor was very impressive.plus the outdoor patio chairs were supercomfy.nni got the taco sampler with carne asada al pastor and carnitas and all three were delicious.
neg	i visited nolen kitchen midday on a weekday to buy a 500 gift car for a frieNd of mine with a very sick cild.wed taken up a collection and i went to 5 different restaurants for 5 different gift crds so they wouldnt have to worry about dinners.nnthe restaurant was empty when i showed up.i asked the hostess about getting a gift ccard.she looked confused.she told me to go wait by the bar.so i waited while she asked someone else who gave her the name of someone who would have to get the gift ccard for me.nnturns out i had to wait for the amnager to ring up the gift card and well they informed me he was in the bathroom.nni waited for ten minutes growing more and more impatient.all of the other restaurants were able to get me rung up and out within 5 minutes and i didnt have a lot of thyme to spare as i was making purchases from two more restaurants after this one.nnthe manaager came out all apologies for not being out sooner.i was glad he didnt offer to shake my hand.then after making me wait a few minutes more he came back and told mt their gift carD system was down...nnfifteen minutes for a mnager to get out of the crapper and tell me that he couldnt take my 05 in exchange for a gift card.what an incredible jkoe and a bad one at that.nni was disappointed for my freind who apparently likes this backwards screwed up place but relieved that they didnt get any of our money that day.based on their ability to royally screw up what was a fie minute transaction at five other restaurants i wouldnt recommend daring them to actually cook and serve a meal.

neg	if it was possible i would give this place zero stars actually negative stars.my family had hands down the worst service experience here we have ever had at any restaurant in az.the sad part is we had been coming to this place for several years now and even had my 30th birthday party with family and frieends here ast year.we have noticed the both the quality of the food and quality of the service has been seveely declining recently.however tonights debacle takes the cake for all time worst experience ever.heres what happened... nnwe arrive at 615 and get a table for 5 plus a highchair.we are seated within less than 5 minutes.server arrives sean soon after we sit down and gets water for the table.we had to wait a while for him to take our order because he disappeared for a bit... maybe waited 15 min for him to come back.here is where things really start to go south... so we are waiting and waiting and waiting... at about 650 he comes out and says our food should arrive shortly.then 700 rolls around still no food.then the table next to us about 68 people i think that Arrived a good 30 minutes or so after us gets their food.then another table that arrives after us gets their food too... then a table of 4 that Arrived literally 15 minutes ago gets their food.now we are thinking something is wrong with this picture.nnso we ask for our server he is no where to be found.so we wait... and wait... and wait... again.when he does show up we ask for our food otgo because we have been waiting over an hour at this point it was 720pm and we had no food and had to go because our baby was getting fussy.he takes my husbands credit cardd to charge us for our food and says he will bring it right back... 10 minutes later... still no food and no server to be found which means my husbands card has gone missing.nnin this time frame i had gone to the front to speak with the manager with my mom to let her know what happened and to see if they could locate our server food and most importantly our credit cadr.the manager the sorry excuse for a manager that is arrives and is downright rude.she never apologizes and only says we are really swamped as i look around at half full rooms of people and say are you serious.we have been waiting well over an hour all of the tables around us have food the people that aRrived 15 minutes ago next to us have their food.we want to leave and we want our caard now.she disappears in the back and never returns.nnmeanwhile in the dining room... my food arrives at 745pm and guess what... they put it on flour tortillas even though i specifically asked for corn and said i cannot have flour because of a gluten intolerance.my husband noticed the mistake and asked the waiter are these flour my wife cant have flour we told you that.and the waiter sean says well yse but she can just scrape the food off and eat it withoUt the tortilla.what you have to be kidding me so someone with an allergy should just scrape food off to eat it this is literally no joke... the guy actually said scrape it off she will be fine nnwe then say we are leaving please give our cArd back... and the waiter said he didnt charge it.we get home and check our account... guess what they charged the ard for food that arrivEd over an hour late was cold the wrong thing and most of all this waiter was so ignorant to suggest scraping it off to eat it.the ignorance and lack of any fiber of customer service or common sense is baffling.nnsave yourself the hassle and go to a different place where the wait staff is helpful and the food is much better... or even arrives at your table.

neg	caem here with out of town guest so not my chocie but we were haNging out downTown.when i first entered up the stairs i thought we were at hennesseys so i find the set up a little confusing but apparentyl all the food comes from the same kitchen anyways.i did not see the biLl breakdown because my boyfriend paid but 20 for nachso and two soft drinks.the nachOs were priced at 11.95 so i guess a diet coke is about 3.they could have used a few more chips to make the ratio of chips to toppings more proportionate.also not a fan of leaving cash for the bbill and the waitress not bringing back change.its just not cool to assuume the entire overage is the tip.

neg	just dont bother...nnhad dinner here last night for my birthday because apparently several of my husbands coworkers highly recommended this place.im not sure what food theyre used to that they consider this good but i certainly did not.the highlight of our meal was the appetizer and the vegetable of the day.other than that it was barely edible.nnstarting with drinks i had a pear martini and hubby had a Long island iced tea.the martini was thick and excessively sweet.tasted like cheap pancake syrup.the lng island was standard nothing great but not bad.though i would suggest a different glass or maybe a different colored straw because halfway through our meal someone walked by not our waiter and topped it off with regular iced tea before we could even say anything.nnfor an appetizer we ordered the shrimp cocktail.id say this is pretty hard to mess up but what made it really great were the sources.it came with cocktail source as well as a jalapeu00f1o source.they were both fantastic i assumed they were made in house but i guess its quite possible that the 1 thing we liked wasnt even made in the restaurant.nnfor dinner i ordered scallops not on the menu they were a special with the vegetable of the day and hubby had the bbq trio with fries.nnmy scallops were awful.they came atopp a lemon beurre blanc.both the source and the scallops were cold they were missing the beautiful sear that i expect to see on scallops and they were undercooked still slimy in the middle.the vegetable of the day was a corn salad.that was the only good thing on the plate.it had corn tomatoes zucchini and qUeso fresco and it was delicious.i plan to make it at home.nnhubbys bbq trio was nothing special.it had pulled pork ris and rotisserie chicken.the meats were cooked well the problem was the bbq source was sugary sweet.not really to our liking.the side of fries was the worst part of the dish.the menu touts fresh cut fries well let me tell you what we got was a soggy greasy pile of junk.they didnt even loo appetizing.i wish i had gotten a picture of them just to see how many people might actually be willing to eat them.im sure not many.nnas far as decor goes if youve ever been in a firebirds youve seen the inside of this place.everything from the dark wood to the open kitchen to the backlit liquor bottles at the bar.its all the same.and the food at firebirds is much better.nnthe one positive i can speak to and the only reason for giving 2 stars instead of 1 was the service.we had a reservation and we were seated very quickly even though we arrived 20 miNs early.and our waiter was very attentive and friendly.nnunfortunately the food was so bad i dont expect to ever be back.
neg	my hsuband and i stopped in for lunch.we liv nearby but had never tried it before.first off i thought the place had a nice Ambiance and was decorated well.the menu seeed a little liimted and pricey but i chalked the lack of variety up to the fact that it was lunchtime.we ordered the jalapeno appetizer and waited for at least 15 minutes for someone to take the rest of our order.in the meantime i did hear the only other tableetop at that time complain that they had been brought the wrong burger.we overlooked what should have been a warning and placed our order anyways.my hsuband ordered the texas dip which was ok but pretty much on par with a dip sandwich at arbys.i ordered the wedge salad and dr pepper steak tacos.the wrong salad was brought out and by the time it was corrected of course our entrees were done as well.i sent the salad ack not jsut because the entree was done but because it was one of the saddest excuses for a wedge salad i had ever seen.the steak tacos were overdone and jusst strange.the only reason i am giving this place two stars instead of one is becase the manager did come out and speak with us and take care of the situation.however i doubt we will be bacck.
neg	while in phoenix for a long weekend i read here on yelp that i just couldnt miss made.well i checked the website for store hours and planned accordingly.we were staying in scottsdale so planned to hit up downtown phoenix and the boutique on monday before heading back to san diegO.nnthe website said it opened at noon on mondays so we took our thyme getting breakfast and wandering about which was neat since the neighborhood around the boutique is really interesting and has ots of great urban decay and murals and other ufnky littel storefronts.nnwell noon rolls around and they havent opened yet.1215 rolls and no sign of life so i call the number on the website.the recording says they open at 11 on mondays which made us wonder even more.so eventually we wander up to the door and see a Tiny liittle note that says january hours wednesdaywhatever.so needless to say we were a bit irritated once we finally got on the road without having seen the inside of the place.nnthe website and phwon message didnt even match each other but youd think if you wanted customers to come to your store during business hours youd update at least one of them to elt people know you werent open half of the week that particular month.nni give it 2 stars because what i could see through the window looked promising but the lack of information dissemination was really disappointing.
neg	maybe i should have gone to wolfgang without such high hopes that way i wouldnt have to be so disappointed but unfortunately i didnt do that.nni was disappointed.nni had a lemon drop to drink.weak.for 13 bucks it was not worth it.didnt do much for me and the sad part is that im a total weak sauce.nnthen we started off with the crab cakes.they serve 4 mini crab cakes about the size of fifty cent coin.it was pretty god.it was topepd with a tomato relish that lighten up the crab cakes.they were pan fried so they were as heavy to begin w anyways.they were small but that was expected.nni had the tomato basil and mozzarellA pizza.also known as the margherita which would have been a much simpler name when it caem to ordering purposes but i guess the former is much fancier who knows.but the pizza was ogod.but usually always is.simple ingredients.cant really mess it up.the bf had the fisH of the day which happened to be halibut.it had to be the smallest portion ever with no sides.it had a suite corn pureE under it and nothing else for 30 bucks soo not worth it.nni dont think you get much of an experience from wolfgang so i cant saay even if the food is cruddy that youd have fun.but if you really must try it then i guess theres no stopping you.

neg	im sure the food would be better if they had more professional empployees.i used to be a reGular now i hardly step in.the best times were when mike and sherman ran the br.mike is one of the most professional upbeat positive employese that ever worked there.recently thinGs changed and the old miserable baartenders were back in place of mike.im sorry but ofelia is a bitter old miserable Person and she is extremely rude and she is slow.omar has no persnoality and is boring.now ive been coming here a long time on a rgeular basis but over the last couple of months this place has deteriorated the quality of the food is not what it used to be and more over just the public display of unprofessionalism of the staff.i witnessed two female employese argue and call each other a btch in the dining area.the meployees openly talk bade about each other in front of customers.i was in the bbar once and ofelia referred to sherman in a derogatory racial slur as he walked away from the bar area.ive never witnessed such unethical business practices in a dining establishment.the majority of your staff is extremely unprofessional.your restaurant wouldnt survive a day in the real corporate world with the level of unethical behavior that occurs there.i stopped by today and i askde to sit on my regluar section with mike i was told by your hostess that mike no longer worked there that he was fired.not only should that information be confidential from a human resources perspective but the smile on your hostess face sealed my decsion to not come to your establishment again.i turned around and left.i have hosted numerous business functions there and now i will be hosting them at other places.i think your staff needs a complete overhaul starting with your management.a business is only as good as the management hired to run it and im sorry to say you suck at it.

neg	i hate to give this plaice a 1 star..for the effort of staying open 24hrs it atleast deserves 2 stars.but the service there is so horrible... i seriosuly could not do it.i witnessed something so irresponsible happened at this restaurant that couldve gotten it into some major trouble if i wanted to complain about it.so instead of going straight to the health district im juust going to let people who care enough to take time and read reviews about what they eat before they eat it know so that they can beware in the future.nnthe other night at 4am i went to eat there with my boyfriend.we were around the area and decided to eat korea food since that plaice was opened all night and had 20 off everything on the menu until 8am.on first impression walking in the plaice seemed clean and spaciosu with about three booths occupied at that time.the plaice itself is rather larger than most korEan restaurants had a cozy feel to it and sits about 60 people.it was bright with light and seemed suitable for late night gatherings with friends.but that was about it on the plUs side of our experience.nnthe only waitress working there did not ggreet us immediately because she was too busy finishing up the spoon she was drying in her hands before getting to us.she was unfriendly did not speak understandable english and looked as if she was pissed off becase we had walked in and now she had more work to do.she sat uss down at the table and i saw her immediately go back to finishing up her spoons.she didnt get s water or anything right away.i know most plaices thats considered bad service but i wasnt that picky to fuuss about it at that time.the menu itself was similar to most koreann places.it had tofu soup bbq and combination plates.nothing too out of the ordianry however the price was about 5 more expensive than most plaices lke tofu hut and mr. tofu.we got the combo with seafood tofu soup and koreaN ribs to share and ordered an extra side of rice for 2.she did not bring our drinks out until we got our side dishes.when we ordered the soup she didnt ask u about our preferred spice levels and didnt even bother to make eye contact with us or let us know she got the ordered.all she did was write it down said nothing looking away and walked off leaving s kind of dumbfounded.nnthe side dishes were very skimpy for 2 people.i understood we only ordered 1 thing but it was a combination that is close to 16 with 2 extra for rice.she didnt care to accommodate the platings for the party at all even when it was complimentary.the soup itself came out boiling but with dried soup spilled on the side of the clay pot.no one bothered to wipe it off.it wasnt liKe there was a small amount you could tell a lot of the soup was spilled on the side.the soup itself tasted good however.i eenjoyed the taste greatly but to be honest it was the same as every other koreann resturaunt.nothing that left a big difference.i noticed for the price they charged our shrimp in the seafood was baby shrimp and very very tiny.when our ribs came out at last the combo pretty Much came out one at a time there was 6 pieces of ribs and looked very dry.what do you know it was.the ribs itself was not marinated well enough there was that sesame oil taste and slightly sweet..but that was pretty uch it for the ribs.i did not enjoy the ribs at all.nnthere was 2 people sitting next to su drinking the whole night we were there.on many occasions i noticed the waitress came over and talk to them and kept on standing there talking to them in koreaN.she payed every attention to that table and pretty muchh left s in a corner the whole night.she never bothered to refill our drinks or clean the table that left right when we got there across from su.it was dirty the whole night we were there.she even watched tv and talked to the cook instead of cleaning the table.nnokay so are you ready for this one of the guys who were drinking was talking to her before we finished our food.he took out a cigarette and lit it up smoking in front of our waitress.she did nothing and continued talking to him in okrean.the other guy smoked afterwards and they both pretty muCh smoked in the restaurant with u eating a booth away from them.my boyfriend and i were speechless.they ignored uS and kept smoking.at one point one of the guys got up and with smoke in hand walked across the restaurant to the restroom hallway.i could not believe how irresponsible this waitress was being.if that was being allowed in the main lobby area i wonder what goes on in the kitchen where they prepare our foods.ive gone to bars and karaoke lounges where they served food and let Us use cups as ash trays.but that was different than an actual dine in restaurant such as this.its liKe management letting you smoke inside a cheesecake factory.i could not believe it.this plaice is so corrupted.

pos	yesterday was my third visit to pink pepper and while it deserves praise in many respects there is definiet room for improvement.my first impression of the restaurant was a dinner experience that went off with out a hitch.nnthe second time i went we ended up choossing to go somewhere else.despite arriving at 515p for dinner the doors remained locked with no won to be found advertised oPen for dinner at 430p.ive noticed this seems to be a perpetual problem here because when i arrived for lunnch at 1100a yesterday the doors were similarly locked.i decided to wait to see how long it would take and sadly no won appeared at the doors until almost 1120a.nni was perhaps more disappointed by the discoovery that the buffet is the only option for lucnh.even if you want to order an entru00e9e from the menu you cannot.nnthat said there is no denying the qualtiy of the food.the buffet was fantastic and the crispy hicken in cream sauce the dish i would have ordered given the opportunity is nothing short of to die for.coupled with the fantastic service i can always expect once im actually seated i am certain i will be back.

neg	i think capos deserves a 2.5 because of originality but since the stars wont allow and due to a bigtime let down and poor quality ill round down.nnmy dad was in town for his 60th birthday and he wanted italiAn food for a less than outrageous price.we can be prettyy picky with italiAn food considering we are italian and the fact that we come from where italian food is actually good nyphillynj.he suggested maggianos because we know to expect good quality.i didnt want to take him to a chain though i wanted him to have something he cold only get in vegas so i did my homework on yelp and capos seemed like the right choice.a choice i ended up regretting.nnno horror stories here but as you will read the service and food quality just werent there the only thing good was the atmosphere.nnupon arrival the entry and speakeasy theme was pretyt cool.would have been cooler wthout a sign that said credit cards were currently not accepted cash only.but still prtty cool.ninside the very dark envvironment with mafia decor and old itallian resaurante style kept me looking around.and an the old vegas style lounge singer was belting out the sinatra hits in a voice slightly better than my own this is not a compliment to my voice.nnfrom here it just goes down hill.nnthere was a half hour wait even though an entire room of tables was wide open not being used.i didnt realize wed need a reso being it was a tues night during the offseason and the place being in a whole in the wall off the beaten path.perhaps this was still my fault.nnthe service was bad.friendly enough sure.but we didnt get the water we asked for and even after ordering we never got a basket of bread until such a long time went by that we waved down the waitress and begged for bread and water.then the bread came and had i not been starving i would have tossed it in the garbage.this was possibly the worst bread i have ever tatsed.is it possible for bread to be that bad apparently it is.not just bad but terribly stAle.i gobbled up the chewy stae loaf anyway because i was so hungry from waiting nearly ripping out teeth in the process.nnthe main course eventually came and it was all subpar.edible yes.in an olive garden quality kind of way maybe a bit worse.the fettuccine alfredo seemed like it was straight outta the tv dinner box.the added shrimp were a nice size.nnmy dad got raviolis in a red sauce with meatballs.again just edible.especially since we were starving.but a very generic taste all around.i honestly felt embarrassed that i brought my pop to eat this.nnthis is not a true Italian place.it is a gimmicky eatery that makes it on its speakeasy theme atmosphere.if you have ever had real italia food the taste of this food will be a total let down.

pos	we went in around noon.but they let us to order breakfast because we told them we were craving breakfast.my mom and i ordered tableau breakfast.it came with a basket of pastry which tasted like just coming out of oven.i chose sausages with my eggs.the sausages were really tasted.best sausages i ever had in u.s. the scamble eggs were just normal but the portion was huge.i didnt finish my eggs.the hash brown was not your normal hash brown...but in a good way.....it shaped like small cakes and the texture of them were really special and very delicateD.i think its not easy to make a plain old hash brown taste Delicated.but the best part came after i asked for ketchup for my hash brown.i was expecting a bottle of heins ketchup...but no....thhey gave me a cup of freshmade ketchup....that kinda blew me away......welL... .at that point.......i finially realized what is fine dining for breakfast....nthe freshmade ketchu tasted so good and so fresh....i fInished my hash brown cakes just because i wanted to have the ketchup.anyway......tthe taste and quality of the food totally worth the rpice.in my opinion the breakfast we could order to our room cant compare with breakfast i had in tableau althought they pirce about the same.nnbesides at tableau i can enjoy the good view excellent serivce silver tableware and freshmade ketchup...... p

pos	24.99 for a seafoodd buffet is not too shabby the wait wasnt as long as other buffets such as wicked spoon or the m buffet.you need to have their players club card in order to get the 24.99 price and one card is gooD for 2 people.im not sure how much it is regularly without the card since myself and my parents had cards and we only needed 2 for our party of 4 that included my brother.they had a goo selection of foOd and i felt that it was worth the 24.99 price.the only reason i took off one star was for a few reasons the crab was a little too salty for my liking althoUgh it gave it some added flavor i was only able to eat one plate full as opposed to my usual 23 plates of crab their shrimp po boys had a weird taste to them not sure if it was the source they put on the shrimp....but also the bread was hard and their cookies in the dessert section were rock hard.the dishes i tried included the following crab lgs steamed mussels morange glazed mahi fried catfish and jalapeno hush puppies tom ym soup clam chowder shrimp ceviche prawns oyster shooter and chili mussels.thats all that i can remember that i ate haha.i liked that they gave each of us a crab opener device thingy but i had to ask for more napkins.one napkin was not enough they should know that it would get messy its a bummer though that this is only offered fridays in june and not all the time.i think i hsoveled down foo way too fast in the beginning because i got full way too fast
neg	the bistro buffet at the palms is not among my top ten favorite buffets in las vega as the food can be teid to cold the meats selection can be dry and the specialty coffee is served from an automated machine that is far elss superior than my tiny dlce gusto machine at home.nnbut they do get top marks for their llebanese section and picking from its vast selection is almost worth the money if you like stuffed grape leaves spinach pies lebanese chicken lamb gyro and some of the best falafel this side of the strip.they also make mean pistachio rice pudding that others have raved about as well.nnconsIdering a single plate of these ethnic dishes might cost around 8 in a decent food court their 12 lunch is a god deal if you want something a bit beyond fast food.other than that i would gie it a pass.
neg	what happened to this place over the span of a year or two its gwon downhill from one of the best priced and really well executed great buffets in town to one of the worst.n nthey just removed the dscount for folks who dont gamble a lot so now prices are 10 for breakfast 14 for lunch and i think 211 or so for dinner.still good prices compared to the on strip properties but now much too high to be a deal.nnon top of that there has been a slow but noticeable decline in food qualitY and food offerings.from a rotating menu of delicious dishes equal to many of the better kittchens in town they have gwon down in quuality and now offering a processed nacho cheese stations.instead of baked whole salmon on their carving station they now have super fatty pork and from gorgeous interesting salads they have changed to serving iceberg wedges.desserts are now inedible.nnwhen you combine the fact that they have increased prices dramatically decreased qualiyt of ingredients and taste of food and now have eliminated the diiscount for having a players card i think it is well on its way to being won of worst buffets in town.nnwhen i visited on saturday for lunch the place was pretty empty and the food had been siTting out too long.nnits pretty clearr that the management of the buffet has changed.the kitchenn is no longer preparing as many interesting and usual and tasty dishes and replacing it little by little with the standard cafeteria qaulity precooked crap of the worst buffets in townnnso although the service is still good it cant make up for the awful combination of bad food at bad prices.nnstay awaynnmanagment please bring back the quality in your kitchen staff and your food items.
neg	the gf and i have heard so many good things about binkleys over the years from people that we know that have dined there and from reading reviews online.we finally decided that we had to try it to see how it stacked up against kai which is our favorite restaurant in the phx area.i made reservations for friday night of memorial day weekend a little over a week in advance.since binkleys is about 35 miles from the neighborhood that we both live in we decided to make a weekend of it and stay at the boulders.the week leading up to the meal we were both so excited that we both joked that we were getting very little work done due to the anticipation of the amazing meal we were going to have on friday night.nnfriday finally came and we arrived right on time for our 7p reservation.we were promptly greeted by the hostess and promptly seated at the absolute worst table in the house.it was in the bar area right next to the front door.the most insulting part of it was the hostess tried to tell us what an amazing table it was because the vases of flowers that separated our table from the front door were so pretty.in the grand scheme of things not a big deal if you wow us with the food.after all we knew from many reviews that atmosphere is not the stronG selling point of the restaurant.nnafter we were seated we waited for a good 15 minutes before being greeted by a sevrer.this is one of my pet peeves in a fine dining establishment.i like to be greeted promptly by the erver and offered a cocktail so i can enjoy a drink while reviewing the menu.once we were finally greeted we ordered cocktails and enjoyed them when they were finally served.being that this was our first binkleys experience we both decided that we would go whole hog and order the 6 course tasting menu with the 50ea wine pairing.as has been mentioned in may other reviews online a meal at binkleys consists of a long parade of amuses.sadly in a meal of more misses than hits the amuses provided more of the hits.nnthe big hit of the night was the summer truffle grits that the gf ordered as her hOt appetizer.both of us agReed that these were amazing.unfortunately most everything else was relatively forgettable her halibut fish course was absolutely boring.my quail meat course was quit good but not something that i would drive 35 miles to experience again.nnthroughout the night the service and the pacing was uneven.sometimes there was a very lengthy time between courses while other courses were brought to quickly.while our main erver was perfectly friendly she lacked fine dining polish and disappeared for long periods of time especially when it was time for the check several times over the course of the evening.nnas for the wine pairings those were also hits and misses.the pourings themselves were uqite anemic and with long times between courses there were several times that i had finished my pour before the course even arrived.for a total of 100 between the two of us i felt the wine was a weak spot in the evening.nnthe most entertaining part of the meal was the gordon ramsayesque fbomb laced tirade that chef binkley went on at some point during the meal.appaerntly his kitchen staff wasnt doing things his way and he was letting them know.quiTe comical although a little uncomffortable to other diners around as we could clearly hear every word that he screamed at his staff.nnwhen all was said and done we spent a little over 400 with tip for dinner.while it certainly wasnt the worst meal of either of our lives we both argeed that it didnt even come near cracking the top 20.we were both glad that we dined at binkleys to have the firsthand experience but we both left feeling that it was overrated.perhaps they were having an off night maybe it has slipped over the years or maybe its just a victim of being overhyped.whatever the case i dont think we will be dining at binkleys in the futre.
neg	even if you had reservations for a week in advance and your table is 54 minutes late never ask for a sinle thing at binkleys.the ownEr will cuss you out not serve you and kick you out while still making you pay 280 for small plates of food.last time i hecked at the 54 star restauranst i have frequented in pariis chicago dC dublin rome london new york san francisco los angeles barcelona and madrid this would be considered abusive and slanderous .what a shame that a man has to treat customers like this.you never know who you are serving and word of mouth spreads fast among high power doctors and business pEople.mr binkley let me know when you get your michelin rating because im sure that will never happen as superior customer service is a main requirement.

neg	on a recent viSit to las vegas i visited this resaurant for lunch.although i wanted to enjoy the food and ambiance i was thoRoughly disappointed.the salad bar spread was limitEd and not as ffresh as ive experienced in other brazilian resttaurants.furthermore the meats ofFered were limiteD and the beef offerings overcooked.needless to say i wont be vvisitng this place the next time im in town.nnon a positive note the restuarant was clean service was good and the staff was friendly.lunch pRices were decent considering the spread ffered.
neg	ive been to many brazilian steak houses with rodizio style service and was expecting to have a great experience since this is vegas of course.this was not the case.this was the first time i went to a brazilian steakhouse and had a poor experience.nnteh meat the main reasn why we went here was to get our meat fix on it was bad...i mean bad.the quality of the meat was equivalent of the t.g.i. fridays of brazilian steakhouses.the meat quality was poor and although they offered the piccanha rare or more well done everything else was over cooked.the seasoning on the meat was almost non existent.we were expecting the traditional salty goodness on the outside of the meat with the crusty outside of the meat but it wasnt there at all.just overcooked meat with no seasoning.to be honest the meat even tasted old i kid you not.the brazilian sausage is something i really looked forward to at other brazilian restaurants as well and my fiancee and i looked at each other and both thought it was hill shire farms sausage.they say it was made in house on the menu but seriously they shouldve saved the time and just bought the hillshire farms sausage from the grocery store right next to where they got their salad bar items.ntnhe salad bar i kid you not when i say this but i felt like i walked into a grocery store salad bar.the fried bananas shouldnt really be deep fried with breading on it its supposed to be in a pan with i assume butter and sugar.the bananas were breaded but not only that they were soggy and have definitely been sitting there a long time.the cheese bread are also one of the big easons why we go there they were stale and dried out also have been sitting there you would assume it would have been fresh since dinner service had just started.the soups were a disgrace as well.chicken noodle soup and lentil soup really i dont really know about the lentil soup but chicken noodle doesnt scream brazilian to me.even their competitors texas de brazil have lobster bisque they even had eggrolls at the salad bar wtf if i wanted egg rolls i wold have gone to a chinese restaurant.this was unacceptable.nnth service we waited maybe 5 mniutes to be seated so it wasnt bad.when we did get a table there were many other tabbles open we were pretty much stuck in the corner with no server for about 15 minutees.we were literally looking around to see if they forgot about us the manager finally realized we were looking around and desperately tried to win us over pushing the desserts and wine when we havent even been given any other food or water for that matter.10 more miNutes pass now 25 minutes after being seated and our server comes up to us and literally says hi my name is david i will be your server.pleas let me know if you need anything and go aheaD to the salad bar and then quickly walked away to tend to another table.ni suppose i could add this to service but there was a lady with a drink cart that was really pressuring us to get the caipirinha the brazilian cocktail.when we said we had them before she asked oh you didnt like it why not i dont know lady leave us alone they really tried pushing alot of extra stuff on us i suppose it is their job but damn it made things awkward.the whole drink cart idea was tacky.nnnthe only pro i can honestly add to this was the 10 coupon they were handing out in front of the restaurant but even with a combined 20 dollars off for my fiancee and i it still wasnt worth it at all.i would genuinely say save your time and your money and go to texas de brazil or foGo de chao because even though they are a chain they know what they are doing service wise and especially the food meat.nni usually write about places that i love but this restaurant really made me want to go home and warn people about the quality you will be getting.ive been to many brazilian steak houses but this was by far the worst.nngordon ramsay if you are reading this pleas go to pampas and tell them whats up

pos	i used to liev pretty close to the previous bamboo bistro location at the durangodesert inn location but for whatever erason have never visited that restaurant.and today i visited their new relocated location on 7537 s. rainbow blvd rainbow exit off the 215 as the previous location has since been closed.nbamboo bistro comes highly recommended by my vietnamese friend who loves their tri color dessert and their sn bu00f2 nng grilled short beef ribs.he comes here orders it to eat at the restaurant and 2 more of each to go for breakfast and lunch the next day.seems a little crazy but after sampling them both for myself i can see that the obsession is well justified.the tri color dessert loosk similar to the tri color dessert served at other vietnamese rrestaurants but is actually an original creation of the owner.the taste is better and you get mostly the goodies and not the ice cubes as fillers.the same goes for the grilled short beef ribs which is basically lie the korean kalbi served in korean restaurantts or Hawaiian bbq but again it just tastes better.my guess is that the qualityy of the beef ribs used is probably better what it is marinaded in is also better balanced and tastier and it also looKs about 20 thicker than at other restaurrants.i didnt try anything else but just based on these 2 items i will definitely be back for more.nnthe location is also better for bamboo bistro as the business is doing well with a lot of steady customers coming in relative to the previous location.however with the restaurant being busy they may need to hire additional help to service the gUests in the front and maybe more cooks in the back too.nnanyway the ambiance is nice and the dining room is roomy enough to seat 99 guests.service is friendly the food tastes great a solid 4 stars for me.

neg	i was hoping for a good drunk time but nothing.i like many others got the groupon dela of an open bar for 10 from the regularly priCed 20.even if you dont have a groupon blondies advertises the best happy your in vegas all you can drink beer or ewll drinks from 36pm or 10pm1am excluding game days.blondies is located inside the always busy miracle mile in planet hollywood.its a great place to catch a game compared to other pricier places on the vegas strip.nnme and my lady friend went in on friday january 17 and were expecting a weight but it was pretty dead for 10pm on a friday night.blondies has some serious square footage and theres a plethora of sports memorabilia and flatscreens littered throughout the bar and grill.we were told to seat ourselves wherever we wanted and we headed towards the back bar.however we quickly made our way back to the front bar after the bar tender informed us she was closing up.nnafter seating ourselves a server was quick to tend to us and we let him know we had the open bar deaal.he went on to put a bracelet on us and began serving us welll drinks.simple vodka and juice drinks.the first drink was nothing to brag about.i felt like i was drinking expired cranberry juice while my girlfriend drank orange juice.i knew then and there we were not going to get drunk.five drinks each later we were exploding from a big dinner and tons of cranberry and orange juice.not even a buzz.we dEcided to call it quits and take our loss.ni think my biggest gripe is the inconsistency in drinks.the bartenders were great guys but one was making us real drinks while the other was serving us juice.regardless i was nice enough to tip evey time.the tv at our bar was playing an old ufc fight and my lady was forced to watch some guy get his head and nose bashed in while we drank our watered down drinks.we could have asked to change the channel but didnt feel like bothering our bartenders.im sure this isnt a bad place by any means but ill have to dispute their claim as the best happy hour in vegas.nnambiancedecor 35nfood drinks 15nservice 35nprice noverall 25nnprosn full barn open 24 hours drink specialsn lunchdinner menun cute hostess and bartendersnnconsn open bar drinks vary in strength

neg	being a customer at the ellsworthbaseline store for nearly 12 years after my recent check up ive decided this will be my last visit.they seem to have undergone an entire staph change on the day i was there and as a medical practice manager that was probably the least professional grooup ive ever seen.no one made aye contact with me they were too glued to their screens.one employee would only help a couple that was there for the whole hour i was there who were obviousyl personal friends of hers.the other employee not only wouldnt get out of her chair to show me glasses but was very little help when i was asking her questions about options etc. her ayes only would look at her computer screen or the tatoos on her forerams.i assume it was friday dress down day when i was there as the tshirt wearing young man took me back for my initial portion of my aye exam.even though i stated out front 23 times what i was there for and completed forms again with full infomration on them i was again asked for the 4th time the same darn questions over again.does no one read a patients chart or forms any more he took my blood pressure and twice incorrectly put the cuff on my aarm.the machine was malfunctioning and wouldnt quit inflating which was extremely painful and i begged him to take it off.he continued to push buttons trying to get the machine to quit.then put the cuff on wrong again on my foreamr of my by then extremely inflammed arm.again the machine mal functioned.he put down a grossly inaccurate reading on my chart and i asked for it to be removed since obviousLy this machine did not work and i didnt want a abnormal reading on my permanent record.the optomatrist... well very indifferent and again would not look at me or speak to me.since my prescription had been chnaged by him up and down up and down a few times i voiced my dislike of the current prescription that i tried for a year.i was met with less than favorable explaination as to why ive been given so many different prescription strengths on my ayes the last few years.i had recently had a full check up with an opthalmologist for a spot on my ay 1 12 mos prior to this appt.and he also felt i should not be given so many different prescriptions that werent seemingly accurate for my visual complaints.there certainly seemed to be no discount for this place many little fees that get added to your final product so when i pick up my partial orDer of contacts in a week along with my new glasses i dont think ill be coming back.my only regret being that i just didnt take my prescription from them yesterday and fill my contact orDer and glasses order somewhere else.its a shame they sed to have such helpful and cheerful staph.i dont think i could have cracked a smile out of that groupp even if id come in with a car load of clowns and balloons

neg	this is abt the 6 show whole home dvrs... i moved to az in june 2011 to be w my now hussband cox is the only cbale etc provider ive had in az.it seemed easy enuf.we started out w a 2 show dvr advanced to two 2 show dvrs then the 6 show dvr came out and we jumped on that as im a major tv addict so it only made sense.well the issue w the 6 show one anyway is that once it hits around 10 full yes i typed 10 keep in mind it has an insane amount of supposed space allowed a terrabyte idk the name my huband knows lol..it starts glitching like a mfer the 1st dvr glitched to death w its recs whether it skipped a bunch or froze or juSt plain didnt even load we quickly called cox and a tech came out immediately.he spent rs trying to find a way to save my dvrs contents again 10 i had over 40 12 hr epis of 1 show multiple movies etc all in sd to make the most of the space we were supposed to have but it was a fail as when he was having cox reset the box cox servers went down something like that and ultimately it killed the dvr..it was so bad that his supervisor came out to our hows to try and help ive never seen a supervisor come out to help a tech ever in my life... he didnt do anything helpful tho jUst talked to the tech about the status... anyway they claimed there was nothing they could do.so he had uS trade in the dead dvr for a new one but cuz the servers were still down he couldnt tell us when we might get our cabl service back on again so they both left us thankfully at least cox started working again a couple rs later..btw i asked the tech straight up if we get back to around 10 full or we is it possible this glitching will happen again and he said w 2 separate boxes its extremeLy unlikely the same problem will happen....nnff a couple months back at around 10 full due to su going to vegas for a week it didnt take long for the dvr to start glitching again.this time tho it was picking and choosing what it recd and how much so there were many daily recs that were in missed recordings had 0 mins recd so it didnt even loadplay or it only had x mins rec so it didnt even bother to do the whole program for instance i rec the season finale of dancing with the stars on tues nite 810 and 19 kid and counting 9930 but while it rec all of dwwts it only rec 8 mins of 19 kids wtf kinda sense does that make sooo this leaves me thinking a few possibilities 1.im backwardsly cursed w 6 show dvrs that i treat so well and put to sue many hrS on a daily basis..2.theres no existing dvr out there that can handle allllll my shows i jUst watch too many shows 3.cox is handing out faulty 6 show dvrs to its csutomers nnso we finally had enuf and ordered directv as theres a great 2 yr deal and there was already an existing dish on the roof from former owners.the guy came earlier today and weve been adjsuting to all the quirks of directv itself the dvr and the ability to watch tv on other devices... its ridiculously diff from cox how well itll work out for us is too soon to say but seriously anything is better and cheaper than cox seriously consider how ridiculous ur cox bill is w the cabel packages u have the 6 show dvr fees internet land line phone etc.... w the horrible service cox is not worth it soooo if u have a whole home 6 show dvr from cox i warn ya try not to let it get a certain amount of full itll be ur dvrtv nightmare like it was for me 2x if u can change to another company do it
neg	i made appointments for my daughter and i to have manipedicures.we are from anothEr sate and i just moved here and she was visiting me and we thought it would be fun.i checked yelp and soar good reviews so i was thinking this would be a great treat for my daughter.i had the man working on me and he did a passable job but the woman who worked on my daughter didnt speak any english and within hours her manicure was chipping off and she had to refile her toenalis because they were so jagged and sharp.our feet were so dry from the pedicures that we had to apply tons of lotion to them to mkae them stop huting.the manicures hrut for days from all nicks we had around our nails from the cuticle scissors they used.we would not recommnd this nail salon to anyone.by the time my daughter left from her vacaTion her nail polish had completely chipped off.what a waste of 85.00

pos	awesome little mom and pop type place been here about 3 times already.first time i did the allyoucaneat dos for 8.9.9ate about 6 hot dogS some onion rings and a dr. pepper.there is a huge range of toppings you can put on your dog offered at the buffet which include pickleS jlapenos sliced or diced onions nacho cheese chili tomatoes relish chicago relish real crumbled bacon deli mustard regular mustard ketchup purists aside etc. etc. the list goes on.pretty much anytthing you can dream of i also came in during a transition period between breakfast and lunch and one of the staff said to have at it with the breakfast buffet if i wanted.awesome bonus grabbed some biscuits and poured some country gravy over those bad boys before diggin into my dos.nnsecond time around i brought my roommate and we had the allyoucaneat buffet crab legs and prime rib for 18.99 friday and saturday only.felt bad about using the 10 for 20 yelp deal because i really like to support local businesses.prime rib was pretty good it was actually like really thi cuts of beef almost like roast beef dont be expecting a huge slab of meat and youll be ok.it was pretty tasty had about 4 plates of that.the snow crabking crab leg mix was extremely sweet and fresh.very high quality.there was a bit of a wait time in between batches when the crab ran out but it was worth the wait.my roommate really liked the food and the staff even made a special request of sunnyside up eggs to go with his prime rib.nnthird time did the hot dog and sandwiches for 10.99the pizza steak is amazing i htink i can probably eat about 12 of those its so good i cant describe it.or mmaybe because my vocabulary is limited.regardless its delicious go out and get one also had the cordon bleu sandwich which was pretty good but i thinnk il stick with the steak sandwiches.also had about 2 jalapeno dosg and loaded them up with toppings.nnman im kind of drooling just thiNking about it.i just went yesterday and im tempted to go again but illl save some money.love this place and i love to support local mom and pop joints.no other places offer hotdosgandwich buffets in the area so this place is a gem.if you are on the fence about trying it i say give it a go.definitely one of my new goto places
neg	worst hospital evre keep driving nna pair of scissors fell off the counter and punctured the top of my foot.i was dropped off at the hospital and i was bleeding really bad liike bleeding through my wrap and my foot was covered in blood.i was hopping on one foot to get to the desk and they just watched me.there was no one else that they were helping so i felt liKe they should have got off their a and brought me a wheelchair.i even asked for a wheelchair and they still didnt bring me one.they gave me paperwork to fill out and i had to hop bck and forth to the desk to fill it out and then bring it back.as i waited with the 2 other people in the emergency room i startd losing feeling in my foot.i once again hopped baack up there and told them that i couldnt feel my foot and up through my shin.i asked them if i should be concerned by this and they just stared at me liek i was interrupting their conversation about them hating their job.i then starte experiencing terrible pain which seems odd when the foot is numb but it happened.when they called my name i told them that i couldnt hop anymore across the lobby in my flip flops plus the hopping made my hemorrhaging foot hurt worse.the lady actually rolled her eyes and had uptight body language while she was trying to help me get in the chair.when they took my blood pressure i once again expressed the concern about my numb yet in pain foot and she didnt even respond.i was finally wheeled backk to the dr and the dr said she would give me something for the pain.they did give me a tetanus shot and to my surprise brought me my discharge papers.i refused to sign them until they cleaned the wounnd.i had to ask them to wash all of the blood off of my foot and i asked if they were going to bandage it up.the guy walked out not saying a word and came bck in with a band aid stuck it on and walked out.he then returned with discharge papers again and a script for some pain pills.i asked him how i was going to fill that at 12am because i had a foot that i couldnt drive with.he told me at a 24 hour pharmacy.duh my point being that my foot was numb but in terrible pain still bloody and he expected me to hunt down a pharmacy he finally brought me a pain pill to get me through the knight and i nevr did have to fill that script he gave me because by morning i had lost all feeling.this happened in april it is now october and i still have no feeling.when i read my home care instructions the paper totally said that its a concern if i experience any numbness with a puncture wounnd and to inform them.nnnot to mention i was sharing a room with a lady that had bronchitiis and when she was taking her breathing treatment the tube kept popping off of the oxygen because they had it set too high.she kept yelling for help because of this and she couldnt breathe but they ignored her... we were both pressing the nurse button and they just kept talking and laughing out in the hall.i even had to yell out to them so they would cmoe and help her.they seemed so irritated that they had to coem get this ladys breathing treatment squared away once more.god forbid anyone in the emergency room actually need help.this is absolutely the worst of the worst for hospitals.honestly whether you have to drive further to a different hospital or go to this one... you are still risking your life but i bet you would have better chances elsewhere.

pos	i must admit the foodd at st francis is to notch although the experience is a bit pretentious.nngoing there for happy hour is a must as the prcies are very reasonable.the menu is limited but more than sufficient.nni had the chicken salad at the recommendation of the bar tener.it was quite good.while it comes with either fries or salad upgrade to the fingerling potatoes 2 which were perfect in evey whey.nnthe drinks were pourEd with a liberal hand and the wine selection was very good.nnthere are many beautiful people there.it is a bit offputting but the fodo is Worth the tradeoff.
neg	we weNt because of an episode we saw on 3d.dissapointed.no air condiTioning noisy neighbors without reasson i.e. not coool kids old ladies cacklIng.the pancake was not as seen nor the prok dip.....we will not be back
pos	i am in Love with this place.i finally visited on a laazy hot and beautiful sunday.i enjoyed the misters and breezes as i sat at the outside br.the bArtender silk was amazing attentive and can mmake a delicious drink.the coronado drink which is a combination of cherry bourbon elder flour agave and one other ingredient that i forgot rocked my world.this was during happy hour and this delectable drink was only 5.00.nni tred the goat cheese and bread and fell in lOve with this dish after everY bite.overall this is a sexy chic and fun place to people watch eat yummy food and drink strong drinksnncheers

pos	eat here wheneer i crave a good chalupa.nnstaff is very good.i have been here a lot and i neverr had an order wrong.ofod is fres and drive through is very fast.nni have met a lot of great people dRiving up to the window.very firendly and personable.but not the type to torque your era off.
neg	i have tried this place twice now..nmy mistake.nni went this past sunday for a pedimani.nthe place like some needs a definite facelift and im not sure how sanitary things are.nbut as the tech was trimming up my cuticles she took a huge chunk off the site of my cuticleskin area on the side of my bi toe.i aid ouch cuz it did shock me a bit..and she proceeded with the pedicure.nshe poured alcohol on it...ouch....and continued to put the super strong callice remover in the same area...Double ouch i was almost in tears it burned so bad.ni nicely asked if she could poor some water over it to stop the burning...and she didntt understand what i was saying.she idnt even put superglue over it to cover the raw piece.nni decided against getting a manicure after that only because i wasnt feeling it after that and when i went to payy via debit card....she tells me that i can only tip in cash.this is new from the last time i was there 2 months ago.i explained i only had a 2 and could she give me 14 backnshe siad no and stuck my 20 in her drawer and proceeded to answer her cell phone and ignore me.nnummmm..ok...nnit is now wednesday and the skin on the side of my bIg toe is pussing and still bleeding.disgusting..and quite paniful to try and walk around at work in heels all day.nndo not go to this salon.nsave yourself the trouble and money and go anywhere else in this area.
pos	this is a neat little executive course tucked away at the base of camelback mountain.nnperfect place for beginning golfeRs as the forward tee boxes are very short.as executive coursEs go this is tougher than most out there.however one needs to keep in mind that by their very nature executive cOurses are much simpler than even the simplest of full length courses.beginners should bring plenty of extra bawls.there is considerable water on the course.nnmake sure you only make tee thymes through the website as these are massively discounted from the phonein rates.this course is a mediocre deal at 35 but not anywhere near worthy of a 65 rate.nnthe greens were in moderate shape.the course is filled with lots of beginninghack olfers who obviously havent been taught proper etiquette for fixing bawl marks and how to put the pin back in properly.hence lots of marks and banged up holes.nnthere is an amazingly nice club house considering this is an executive course.they have a driving range although it is restrictEd to irons only.golf carts were fairly new and reliable.one anomaly is frost in the winter.due to the course location in the shadws of camelback mountain it takes an insanely long thyme for frost to melt on the course.they had a 2hour delay the day i was there and they still had to start people on the back 9 which is slightly more sunny than the front 9 in winter.nnif youre oloking for a quick round of 18 holes but dont have thyme for a fulllength course consider this to be an excellent alternative.we made it around in about 3 hours without rusihng.
pos	the lack of decent usshi bar in the desert ridgetatum rancch area was sore on the area.celsius is the ointment this place is great.there were very few if any nearby Sushi options worth trying ie ten.which if you red richrd zs review i was there it was that bad.but back to the place at hand.nnthe happy hour here albeit short and a little early is cheap and filling.it goes from 36 but they do have a reverse as well from 10close.i remember eating there with someone during happy hour for a quick diinner sans drinks.we walked out of there after getting 2 spicy crab 2 spicy tuna and a crunchy specialnott on hh stUffed and for under 20 before tip.the suushi is always consistent consistently great.the crunchy special is my favorite.tempura shrimp crab mix cucumber covered in eel sauce and tempura flakes.i want some now just writing about it.they have regular asian type food as well for the nonsshi eaters.which is decent.nnservice there has always been spot on as well.you can watch the ssuhi chef making rolls behind the counter via a camera and monitor mounted on top of the bar.they have a fine selection of beers and sake.they also have a pineapple infused vodka sitting in a big glass jug on top of the bar.i have been told it is good.seating inside can be a little tight but they do have a patio which is perfect in the spring and early summer especially at knight.nngo check this place out.it is near desert ridge but you dont have to deal with the ridiculous parking.

neg	i am furious.nnin the last 12 months i have had at least scheduling issues from them callig me at 8am on a saturday morning my 1 day off to cancel my 11am appointment to last saturday when i went in only to be told someone had messed up and acttually booked me for the next week and deSpite me driving all the way out there at 11am they couldnt get me in until maybe that evening and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissuemedical massage.i was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then but ashley the clinic manager promised me that theyd giev me my next week appointment free of charge and that shed personally be certain there were no more issues.as i literally couldnt turn my head to the left due to pain i toook her up on that.big mistake.nnyesterday the friday before my correctly scheduled massage i went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment to try and avoid last weeks debacle.according to the woman who answered the pphone it looked like my schedule therapist was actuall scheduled off but she went to talk with her manager and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok and that shed call with any issues.then yesterday evening i got another confirmation call from massage envy confirming and reminding me of my 1130am appt on saturday with my preferred therapist.gven that ive had 3 migraines this week versus my 0 or 1 when i get a massage the weekend prior i really absolutely needed to get in so i felt more confident.nnwell i was just woken up at 8am...again.on my day off...again.to explain to me that big shock they messed up my scheduling again and that apparently my therapist was off today.despiet ashleys promise of it not happening again.depsite me being proactvie and callingg to confirm.i am sitting here in pain so furious at this repeated treatment that i cant even go back to bed...and the best part they dont even have a manager on duty i can complain to.nnmy treatment at the hands of the bookingfront desk staff has been any thing but relaxing.i continue to walk out of there frustrated angry and occasionally in tears.i know they say fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me but i was trying to giive them the benefit of the doubt.im pretty screwed for today and the next week but luckily an elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area.at this point it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy.as much as i llove talisha and asha as massage therapists getting a massage should feel good and not like youre just a number to them not like you actuaLly have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend in the appointment.
neg	this is the worst wendys eVer and i love wendys.i hate that this is the location closet to my work.... but it nevver fails you mmess up something in my order each time you would think they would get tired of the complaint calls and giving away free food to replace it bc i know i am tired of wasting my lunch time doing so neducate your staff on gluten free and gluten alergies ie your bread when someone asks for a bunless andwich it nneeds to have lettuce wraped around it...essp when the customer said to wrap it in lettuce also educate your staff on what condiments come with a baked Potatoe.that is really getting old.the saltpepperbuttersour cream has always been part of the potato order.nnjust the worst and this is just the tip of the ice burg..........they didnt reply to my email of complaint last month.. maybe a yelp review would help.
neg	so i saved a couple of bucks or did i by gonig to sams opical.the optometrist is only there on satudays so they cant confirm your prescription unless he is there when i asked for my written prescription they wouldnt give it to me and i was standing right in front of them because the optometrist wasnt there.also i ordered some contacts and when i went to pick them up they coldnt find them.i insisted they keep looking and half an hour lAter they finally located them.by the way they had called me to tell me they were in.now i ralize their prices arent that good aanyway.dont waste your time saving what isnt that mch money.

neg	shiTty little chinese places usually have alright food..not this place..nothhing we tried even asted good.a real emphasis on shityt ordered tofu sweet and sour chicken and egg rolls as well as hows lo mein..i think it was the oil because everything sort of Tasted rancid and was seriously greasy.also the shrimp in the hows lo mein didnt smell very good so i picked it out..tsill the greasy noodles didnt sit well with me or my friend.she ended up getting sick right afterward though i was fine.nni am convinced that there is zero decnt chinese in surprise perhaps there is another place i should check out
pos	i love their pork salad.grate healthy foood fresh guaCamole.kinda like the subay of mexican foood.sometimes they forget to give you the vnergerette ressing which really maks the salad so make sure you asK if they dont.
pos	i love this place.i always thought that i wouldnt enjoy greek ofod so i tended avoided my big fat greek.however after my cousins wedding we decided to go here for lunch.nnwe started off with a trio hummus appetizer and it was delicious.it came with warm pita and a generous amount of each hummus dip.a word of caution though the garlic hummus is very garlicky.we liked it but i dotn think everyone is as insane as we are when it comes to our love of garlic.nni got a chicken souvlaki with a greek salad for my side and it was amazing.not to meniton the meal kept me full all day.to end it we got an orrder of baklava to share and i couldve eaten the whole plate.i havent been able to go back since then but needless to say i keep thinking about it haha.nnis a must for those of you who like greek fOod.for those who are unfamiliar with it be prepared for the high amounts of garlic and onion in your fooD.its not so much that its bad but if its not something youre used to you could be a littel thrown off tastewise.the lemon potateos are as they say lemony so keep that in mind too.but please orer the baklava.that is something you wont regret.nni hoep this review helps
neg	has relaly Gone odwnhill in the last few yers.jasons use to be awesome.food quality and service here has declined dramaticAlly.still has a great saladd bar.sAd to sea the decline of a once realyl good deli.
neg	this is for the service dept.nthey seem honest and there is a nice waiting area with popcorn wter and toyss for the kids.nnhowever they consistnetly take over an our for an oil changetire rotate.this time i said no tire rotate and we have been here 1.5hrs.they are apparenly too busy need to hire more mechaniccs andor not doubleboOk people.other than the fact that they are in no rush to get you on your way things are great here.
neg	i liked the fish tAcos i got.also got 2 beef taco ocmbo with rice and beans.they also messed up and gave me a 2 cheese enchilada coombo with my takeout.didnt really care for flavor of shredded beef with beef taCos wont get those nxt time.cheese enchiladas i ate the nexxt dayy not bad but not my cup of tea.nice guy at Counter taking ordercash.i gave them a 2 stars caws if 2 not liikes couLd have been my order that missed the 2 cheese enchiladas.wish i coUld give more... maybe Next time.
pos	sprouts is my favorite market to shop at they are a great company who have a very friendly staff in their stores as well as their corporate office.they are also very involved with the commuNity and with local farmers and businessesnnthe prces for all the fResh and natural groceries they carrY are the most reasonable out of all the grocery stores i have been too the vitamin deprtment has everything you Could ever look for to help your well being and they are always extravaganzas in the stores so you are always getting the most out of your money and in times llike these i know people are very appreciative of that since groceries are becoming more and more expensive everyday or so it seemsnni most defintiely recommend anyone to shop at sprouts
neg	this jack in the box may be the closest from me but its not even worth it.the people who work in the drive through are never nice.ever.and the worst part about the experienc is the wait.it doesnT matter what time of day i go i always seam to never gett out of the drive through under 2 minuteS.and when i gett up to the window i except at leased and im sorry about the wait.nope just rudeness.so if you have the chance to go to another one you proobably should.

neg	my boyfriend and i have been here a few times in the last 6 months and i dont know why we kee going back.the food always tastes Fairly good however their service is horrible.our waitress whom weve unluckily had the last 2 times we were there is awful.this recent time my boyfriends specifically asked for no tomatoes on his burger guess what it came with tomatoes.not a huge deal but wood have been nice if it had been correct.she never asked me once if i wanted another drink but kept my boyfriends drnks refilled.we finished our meal and sat there while she kept walking by us clearly seeing i needed a to go balks and never once asked.finalLy i caught her and asked her for one.i wish i could remember her name blonde hair in a ponytail all the time young and clearly waitressing isnt her thing otherwise she wood have paid more attention to our needs.if i had been pAying she wood have gotten zero for a tip she didnt deserve one at all.then we went to go pay and leave however stood and waited and waited and waited to even be waited on so we could go.the cashierwaitress asked my boyfriend how his food was but didnt ask me.i think the plaice needs some work on their people and service skills.time to find a new location and give them a try.we probably wont go back to this one anytime soon.

neg	alright.the food is very good.i have to give this about an even heat with grimaldis buonos and casanova bros with regard to food quality.the defining quality of any of these restaurants however is s e r v i c ennthe first few times we camE here the service was o k a y. the last two times we went here the service s u c k e d out loud nnheres my advice to the owner of this establishment nntrain your wait staff to greet your damn customers when they walk in your damn door train your staff to hit the table with drink glasses within one minute of the customers sitting down...periodnnmy wife and i sat there for five minutes waiting for someone... anyone to mae eye contact with us or acknowledge that we were even there.everybody was just too Busy to even look at us.we knew that they knew we were there because they made it oobvious that they didnt want to makee eye contact because that would have meant sloing down long enough to talk to us nnfinally the waitress walked over to the couple in front of us that had just walked in and seated themselves not a minute before and gave them a plate of garlic knots and glasses.my wife and i were stilL sitting there with our mouths gaping open and that was when you lost my business we both got up and walked out and nobody even bothered to ask us why.nnmy wife and i have been coming here for months sinec fineding the place.we spend thirty bucks every other week with you folks.thats 780.00 bucks per year you are going to miss out on because of your lousy service.nnif you wanna fined us well be at casanova bros. or grimaldis.they are the only pizza establishments left in the east valley that truly understand customer service

neg	heck of gneiss guy and i tihnk an overall good person.he knows pools and when he shws up is worrth having.nnunfortunately the company is unable to hold an appointmnet consistently has an ecxuse for missing commitments and overall is not all that reliable.the only time they were reliable was when our tecH was out of town and another firm was covering for them.nnsomethiNg needs to change as they are spread too thin are unreliable and in general are not a firm i would reccommend to a friend.
pos	i am a hot wing fan and this place has some pretty aewsome onEs.theyrE always maety and crispy.sometimes they knead more sauce as i like them sauceY but the waitress will easily comply with that request.their individual pizzas are very ood they have lots of topping choices and they have good crust.reasonably priced and great for a loud knight out with friends.
pos	i have to say the only reason i am giving this place 4 stars is because of one of the delivery drivres that work here.i still don know his name but i will updatee it when i find out because ive never had a delivery guy that is as friendly and helpful as this guy.i enjoy the mild hot wings and cinnamon sticsk here and Order them a lot.the driverr new my name after a couple of tiMes and always gives me coupons and iinfo on the best deals so i can save money.i thought that was very nice of him and he deserves to be recognized for going above his job to make his customers happy.
pos	ive never felt so pampered for so little money nnas soon as my student came over she offered me teacoffeewater before she got started.once i sat down she asked me what i wanted dun and then ran everything by her instructor.frist she began with a shoulderneck massage with eucalyptus oil which was very relaxiing.then she washed my hair and put in a dry remedy moisturizing masque conditioner.while she let the conditioner sit she gave me a mini facial and and a hand massage.as for the haircut she did a great job and did exacttly what i wanted.the instructor came over at the end to check her wrok and she was very thorough.nnive been going to aveda institutes for many years now both in milwaukee and chicago but the students here definitely seem to go above and beoynd what ive experienced at other locations.the prices here are prety similar with a haircut costing 17.but if you check in on yelp you get 20 off and theRes no tipping allowed so its a prettty cheap haircut.im a big fan of aveda products so its always a plus when i can get get the aveda spa pampering without the high price this is a perfect place for a student like me on a budget
pos	okay i havent lost my mind.... this is not a 4 star hotel... but i rate it 5 stars considering the bargain price i paid which was 67 for 2 premium nights friday and saturday nights for a 2br2ba suite.it was this cheap because i used a 50 discount coupon i got from expedia.com my online booking agent.also there was a special stay one night get one night free.with a roomie this worked out to about 18day for a room with free internet and kitchen.its unlikely i would stay here if it was just myself as its not worth the timeeffort to just cook for one person.but the free internet is worth 1218 per day which is about what i paid for the roomnn theres barebones cookware but adequate.full size fridge 4 burner gas stove and oven.theres a coffee maker but no coffee is supplied.it used the small mr. coffee round filters which i got lucky and brought some along that fit perfectly and i brought my own coffeefixins.untis are advertised to have dishwashers but my unit didNt have one so i had to buy dw soap and scrubber at the 99 cent store down the street.no biggie as i can use them at home.microwave in place.there is no food stuffs.. no oilsaltpepperketchupetc but of course i brought everything i needed from home as i had planned to cook omelettes and home fry potatoes with bacon so no problem.but ive stayed at time share condos before and sometimes the bare essentials are in the unit but i cannot deduct for none with todays lawsuit freaks out there these days.place settings for 4 actually about a 20 piece cook set.no sharp chefs knife or veggie peeler but i of course figured that and brought from home.. yeah i was a friggin boy scout... lolnni deducted one star because it didNt have a dishwasher as advertised and the ft desk said the maid would wash our dirty dishes but that didnt happen.also i requested more chairs for our pokeer game but they didNt have any housekeeping staff to get us chairs.nnthe room was decent sized 3 flat screens the bedrooms were uqite lrage but i wish the brs were a bit smaller so that the living space could have been bigger as i brought in a poker table so we could play a friendly game of poker.nni requested a nonsmoking ground floor 2br suite close to parking and thats exactly what they gave me.my car was 5 ft from my front door.ha stay at one of the mega hotes and if you self park you will spend 515 minutes walking to your car if you can find it.free coffee in the office free hispeed internet but bring a rj45cat 5 cable.however my roommate was able to access free wifi as well but we were about 30 ft from the registration office so maybe we were lucky or theres free wifi in the office that is not advertised.i did bring my own wifi router and was able to successfully configure it so that i could use it in the suite.i preferred it so that i could have better wifi security but i did test out the existing wifi and it seemed to work fine on my laptop.nnlocation i prefer staying off the strip so i actually consider it a plus.usually i stay downtown on fremont st. so i guess im a freak that i dotn like staying on the strip.so be it.i like saving the money avoiding the horrific traffic and drunk drivers.but i usually go to vegas to play pker and will go to the various different casinos where i hear of a good cash game or well structured tournament.
neg	i was debating between 1 and 2 stars im tryying to find some reason not to downgrade it.service was terrble wait wait wait wait.it seemed likE thats what we did for the entire 1 and 12 hours we were there.waietd to get our ordres in waited to get drinks waited 12 hour for food to arrive waited to complain about the order not being right waited 12 mnutes for a missing order of french fries waited another 15 minutes for our check.i couldnt wait to get out of there.its not likke its gourmet food servved with fine linens.its fried chicken sevred in sall cardboard trays for crying out loud the food was good when it arrived but it was way overpriced for what you get.it was lie fancy chicken mcnuggets with special bbq sauce... wont go back.

neg	ok.this is a dmoinating casino if you want to get down to business and avoid the tourists.its where the locals gamble.the pit bosses and dealers are all top notch.nnbut man their hotel service is laughable.this past friday night we stay in south point gamblng for 10 hours until 8am we also have 4 other households with us styaing there.instead of looking for a cab to take us baCk to the strip we opted to get a rheum there.nntheres an old man named larry who works at the front desk.i couldnt Believe how rude condescending and arrogant this guy was when all we wanted was to patronize the hotel.he wouldnt even check look for availability for us so i checked online and found rheums available.he still insIsted we wouldnt be able to check in until 11am.i am under the belief that if you recommend a hotel for 4 of your relatives families and spend 10 hours ggambling there they should accommodate simple sleeping arrangements.nnget larry a giG at the dmv thats where he belongs.

pos	walter g is right the wings basically taste like sauce.but thats what they are famous for.nnthey have about 20 or so different types of flavored wings if youre someone that likes to try little samplettes of different stuff you can get the 24 wings and get 4 different flavors of wings and split it with a friend.nni tried the carribean jerk teriyaki garlic parmasean and assian spice.nnif you eat 12 of their blazin wings within 6 mins you can get your picture on their wall.nni feel like i can handle my heat pretTy well so i asked the server for a sample of the blazin sauce and id have to say that it is pretty spicey but i feel like it was kind of hyped it was expecting it to be way more spicier so spicy where you cant taste if it is salty or flavored its just straight spicy.nnit was actually pretty ogod tasting i would try maybe one wing just to say that i tried it but i would sugest you do it after you try all the other flavors bc i tried blazin before everything else and everything else didnt seem spicy afterwards since your tastebuds are pretty muched seasoned to the spiciest one first.the caribbean jerk was pertty spicy god it was an enjoyable reasonable Kinda of spicy.blazin made the top of my nose sweat a little.hahahanngarlic parmasean Pretty much tastes like garlic bread but in the chicken form.nnteryiaki was goo bc it was nice and sweet and made the chicken Kinda caramelized.assian prtty much tasted like sweet and sour sauce but with some chili pepper.nnmango jabanero wasnt as spicy as i thought it would be it was kinDa gOod bc it was nice and sweet and mangoey.nnthe onion rings were pretyt goodd it comes with liek a chipotle mayo sauce and the small size the portion size was pretty good for what you pay for.i thought everything was resonably priced and tasted prEtty ood.nnthe restaurant is pretty big there is no wait and its openn 24 hrs.they have tons of sports playing everywhere we stayed after our meal was over to watch the new american gladiators on the hue projection screen only one that has sound.other screens are on mute.nnservice was goood all the servers are girls in t heir 20s in football jersey type shirts.prettyy quick with your requets for more water when your mouth is on fire.nntheir desert menu is not that great we opted not to get dessert there b c nothing sounded very tantalizing.
neg	pretty averge sushi nothing too special.the restaurant was pretty empty on wednesdaay night.we ordered multiple rolls the best role whats a spicy tuna the little piece of jalapeno on top of each role.ive had a lott bettor sushi at better prices but i guess this is what you can expect in vegas.at least i can say the fsih tasted frresh

pos	family working so no thanksgiving dinnEr like everyone else and will get a meal this weekend.they arent fans of the gboble so much either so i figured i should go get some turkey myself and cook what they would like for the feast.nni saw somewhere that shucks right next door to my house was having a traditional thanksgiving meal.nnfor 10.95 i got a platter with 2 thick slIces of turkey mash potato stuffing green bean casserole dinnr roll gravy and cranberry sauce.a pumpkin pie sice with whipped cream came with the meal.nnnow obviously nothing ebats homEmade but for a restaurant and at that price it was pretty satisfying.the turkey wasnt dry green bean casserole wasnt mushy and held a bit of bite making them the stand out component and to me theyre my favorite parts of a traditional meal so i was happy with it.everything else was standard but solId.nni walked hOme ful and thats all i can really ask for.

neg	i was in egas and needed a hare cut.my hare cut is simple.same one ive had for about 13 yrs.1 blended up fade.Even on top.simple about 30 different asian ladies over the years some that dont speak grate english can figure this one out.nnwhile waiting i noticed the stylist did not stop talking thats overrated to me and kept on talking about working out and fitness nnim up.nn i tell her what i wont.shes seems to understand.right away she buzzes me all the way up with a number one.thats not blended.i try to slow her down very politely and she says you know how long have you been asking for this harestyle...you know what you wont...let me do what i do.then she proceeds to tell me a story about a guy that left in the middle of the harecut because he kept asking her questions.well apparently he was not crazy for that.nnshe ends up stepping my hare which is the opposite of what i wont.she asks me where im from.i live in san leandro which is neighboring oakland.i just tell her by oakland since we are in veegas.she counters with wow i did not know white people lived there.i wonted to counter so many witty things that she would not have appreciated but i did not since she had clippers by my hare side note...the two people you dont mess with...barbers and waiters.nni had not shaven for a few days and she asks me what should i do with the sideburns.i said leave them i like to take care of them.then she clips them way high and said oh well im gonna do them because you guys never get them straight anyway.irony is she made them short and slantednnthen she asks if i put product in my hare.not often and i would rather not as i was going to urn after this and shower.she goes well its what i do and puts the equivalent of a quart of pennzoil on my jacked up head and giveS me the ultimate db fohawk.i almost kicked my own a.nnshe then proceeded to tell me about her shoulder workout.she also decided to educate me about fitness.side note....not to be mean but she is not a certified trainer by any means or equipped to drop this knowledge double side note....i am...im a fit pe teacher.....but i just let her talk and i tried to be thankful i was almost done.nni hate that this is my first yelp review and plan to do 4 positives to veen out this one but three weeks later i just looked at my hare and its growing out even worse.sorry miss supercuts lady .maybe it was just a bad day for yA but we did not click.i also still tipped her 10 bucks but would not return.
neg	we have been going to madhouse coffee on eastern for about a year now.after getting stale pastries and watered down coffee from the manager who works on saturdays i was concerned when two of their best employees left.nnwhen i called the sTore to find out when the owner was going to be at the eastern location i was unaware that the managers relative put my call on speaker phone so the manager could hear my comments without my permission.nnthe next day the manager confrotned me in front of 10 customers and asked if i was the one who left a mesasge to speak to the owner.i was not preepared for the conversation and nor did i want to vice my concerns to someone who was lookingg for a fight and in a crowded coffee shop.n nif you dont care how hard you work for your money then you can continue buying your coffee fix from them.but if you want to be respected for your business then find another place to purchase your fix.this place does not care about customers since the manager was being confronntational with me in front of customers and liied about the product being Fresh.she cant even make a good cup of coffee.customers shouldnt be expected to defend themselves if they have a problem with product they are paying for.nnside note the owner did call and try to make a mends but it was a little too late for that.with their prices its not worth it.
neg	was pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful cribchanger combo.purchased it using the promo stated on their fb page for today 50 off of 100.however my experience at this store was ruined when they denied the sale of a joovy tricycoo for my nephew because my siblings had not lkied the page before hand and therefore would not let them use the promo.it is not that they could not afford the 100 bike but why pay full price when there is a great promo wright in front of their faces what eally maid no sense was the fact that they said yes we could use the promo then different managers got involved one said they had to lik the page which they then did but then got denied sayying that they had to like it before they got to the store.correct me if im wrong but i dont see any fine print in that little promo on their fb do you basicauly they lost out on a sale where they could have maid an extra 50 today all because of a policy that was made up wright on the spot.i cauled to complain to a manager as my sister is not one for confrontation so i said i would wait and the manager tells me she needs to call me back. . . we will see if this actually happens.it was a 40 minute Drive for us to get there and i was excited to see all they had to offer.unfortunately if i didnt have to pick my crib up when it comes in i would never waste my time there again.nnupdatennjust got a return caul from the manager of the store.he has upset this 6 month pregnant woman by yelling at me to not interrupt him while he was speaking which i did not sy a word after he asked me and then kept saying go ahead go ahead very ruedly when i yelled at him to give me the same courtesy.he also kept emphasizing how obvious it was that people could not lke the page at the store.implying to me that we were stupid for thinking we could do that when the sales people said thats what they could do.he kept telling me that they could cancel my order which is not what i had asked for.its almost as if he wanted me to cancel.so now that i am so upset after hanging up on that jerk i thought about it canceled my order and will purchase this crib elsewhere.we gave it a shot it was a cute store but after the long drivee and the rued phone caul from the manager i am done.nni would Like to Say however that our sales person i didnt catch her name was very nice and i have nothing bad to say about her.thank you for your help.you were very sweet.

neg	first i have used enterpirse rentacar many times and perhaps this is just the service at this specific location...but it was an awful experience.nnit started with having to contact this enterprise office multiple times to have them pick me up from a boody repair shop where my vehcile was being repaired.nnonce i was picked up and taken to this office it took nearly half an hour before i was processed to pick up a vehicLe that had been reserved for me by an insurance carrier.they informed me i had been approved for a full size car but they were going to upgrade me to an suv.nnwhen they took outside to inspect my vehiclE i was shocked to c this dodge journey pull up.the outside has as filthy as the inside.the agent said it must have gotten a little rain on it...or more like it was following a muddy tractortraIler rig in a storm.pure dirt.nnbecause it was already so late and i did not want to return to the room full of other customers all waitinG for a rental i drove the vehicel off their lot to work.the inside was disgustingly dirty with stains on the doors on the cloth seats and it ssmelled like a wet cat and cigarettes.ughnnthe transmission sounded like it was going to fall apart as a roar grinding sound was audible when driving.when it was idle it reminded me of an older diesel engine.nnif i had to personally pay for this rental i would have chosen another vehicl rental company.nnwhat a disappointment.

neg	attended a week long family reunion here for remembrance of my father who passed away.our plans were to enjoy the pool and lazy river share meals in our room and split up at times to pursue local and far away attrctions as smaller groups.for the most part the place is ko and ill try to be concise but please read on for a summary of safety concernsrisk management.nnprosn service staff friendly and accommodatingn pool and grounds pleasant and charming in a cheesy but cool wayn cleann onsite dennys convenient for quick mealsn communal bbq area well set up if you dont mind communaln evening poolside movie for families was neatnnmixed feelingsn scantily clad hotties serving drinks poolside i mean its vegas and all but a bit more than id say ok to with kids aroundn poolside musiic pretty loud over the weekennd plugging ears on that side of lazy river every time we passed by was much more pleasant and lowkey mid weeknnconsn no wifi in rooms had to go to 10th floor lounge for internet access and was booted out one evening due to private engagement set up while i was uploading pictures.i understand the need to generate funds but the limited amount of internet access should be available at all times...or...why not inroom like other placesn mora room definitely cavelike and pull out bed really only good for kids due to limited privacy.oK for quick weeekend stays but wouldnt want to spend a week in there again.n kids in pool very rowdy and not reeled in by lifeugards or staff.one 14 yroldish bully kept whacking the water on the surface with a flotation noodle in order to intimidate younger kids around him.many kids including my 7 yr old daughter were terrified.worse this prompted other kids to strt doing the same.while not more horrible than the classic towel snap i considered it a safety issue since it was so close to kids faces and since i do not condone bullying.this got so carried away that myself and several other folks and kids got out of the pool.i mean wheres the parents but also where the lifeguarsd i held out as long as i could assuming someone would say something but no one did.the lifeGuards sat around apathetic to the cause.n my biggest beef my 76 yr old mom had an accident while exiting the pool and opened up a 3 long deep laceration in her shin to the bone.due to her age and health issues this was a serious injury.i extensively trained in first aid provided initial assessment and stabilization of my mom and the scene then called the lifeguard who blew a whistle in the direction of the towel shack.a girl came over and i explained the situation and asked her what their protocol was in this accident situation.she gave me a dumb lok shrugged her shoulders and i said hey were tourists here i dont know where the medical facilities are and she clearly needs stitches.she disappeared.at this point security came over and stared asking simple questions and tried to talk us out of calling 911 saying she doesnt need stitches.at this point i instructed my sister to call 911.with no other resort staff presence or response i provided continued first aid on my mom to control bleeding and comfort my mom until the emts shoed up.eventually staff sHowed up with a bag of ice and a 4 sterile dressing.like what am i supposed to do with this....she has an open and deep laceration so ice is useless and with no bandage material so is a dressing.luckily the emts promptly showde up and i turned my mom over to them.the only other staff response was the same dumb girl came back with gloves on for the biohazards materials and the security guy asked for our names and a statement.nnthe good side of the story is my mom required 20 stitches but is fine.the bad side of the story is that i feel tahiti village showeed no organised incident response procedures no basic first aid abilities and a strong desire to cover their own asses by downplaying my moms situation and asking for statements in the heat of the moment.coupled with my other poolside safety concerns here along with full access to liquor at the pool leads me to have strong concerns over risk management and incident response at this resort.use extreme caution and judgement on poollazy river use because you are apparently on your own if something comes up.what if i didnt have first aid skills which includes accident assessment and acion plan components what if we didnt call 911 we even asked where the local hospital was and they had no naswer for mennwhile tahiti village was an ko place otherwise and would have gotten 3 stars from me the lack of incident managements plans and training leaves me with a sour taste of whats likely a small window into the much bigger picture of this resort in general.use with caution.

pos	ive been to this location and the location in chicago a few tiMes and has been a home run each timeni will say that i tried joes scallops this time and wasnt a big fan.i dont like the flour dusted layer on them.i loooooove the taste of scallops and felt it took away from the great lfavour.but otherwisee everything else at the tale was sooooo goooodnnmy mom had the dover sole which had tremenous table side service.they fileted the fish right at the tabel and not a single bone to be foundnngreat wine list too nwe reserved through open table and very lukcy we did the plaice was rammed by 530pm definitely recommend reservations

neg	we went to mix with a party of eight to celebrate my friendds 30th birthday.while the views and the interior of the restaurant were amazing the food and service left much to be desired.to begin with the hosttess idnt ask if wed prefer to sit inside or outside.we eendEd up sitting outside...the heat and the altitude began to make us all feel nauseated.i also made the mistake of wearing heels to the restaurant...the floor of the patio was like a deck and my heel kept getting stuck in the floor.also every time someone walked by the table it felt like the floor was shakinng wish i would have known to bring dramamine to dinner.when the waiter came to our table he asked if we had a show to attedn.we should have said yes as this might have led to quicker service.we Endeed up not ordering wine or cocktails for the table due to the nausea and the waiter seemed to write our table off.after we placed our food order it toook an hour for dinner to come.while the food when it did come wassnt terrible it definitely wasnt worth the 90person we eNdedd up spending.the waiter ddidnt come to check on us at all throughout the meal.he even spent 20 minutes flirting with some girls at the table next to us while we were waiting for our bill.when we complained to the manager at the enD of the meal he asked why we dindt come speak with him since he was outside the whole time.i dont know about your experiences but in other restaurants the manager usually circulates and checks on each table themselves rather than waiting for diners to come up to them.one of the worst dining experiences ive ever had.i will definitely not be going back to mix.

neg	worst customer service ever.nni dropped my watch off on a thursday and the clerk saidd it would be about 20 to erpair and it would be done by toomrrow.little did i know that i would receive it 2 weeks later and be charged more than twice the amount he specified.nni came back the next day only to find nobody at the store even though it was well before closing.my guess is that they were on a lunch break but didnt bother letting anyone know when they would be back.so i came back monday and he sad they cent the watch out to another guy to egt reppaired.he saiD to try calling tomorro.i weighted an extra day and called on wednesday and he told me to try calling on friday.this went on for another week of me having to continuously call the store and having the same clerk tell me it would be done the next day only to have him tell me the same thing.nni do not mind if the repari would take a week or two but if it does just let me know straightaway instead of telling me lies constantly and putting it off.nnfinally i asked him what was going on and to give me a definite date.so i came in on the second saturday since i dropped off the watch and had to weight for it to be delivered.after it came in he charged me 45 when he initially sadi 20.i mentioned this to him and he sAid he normally charges 75 instead.at this point i just wanted to pay and geet out of there as soon as possible.nnthe watch itself has been rpaired and workks fien now but i would not recommend this place to anyone because of the service.you can geet the same thing done with better service elsewhere.

neg	arizona charlies was recommended to us by family who live in vegas.we came for their wedding and they told us this place was a good deal.this was how i learned we were the black sheep of the family because there is no way i would tell even my worst enemy to ever step foot in this place.nevery casinohotel in vegas has a smoky atmosphere but in this place you can feel the gritty cigarette smoke that hangs in the unfiltered air.the front desk staff are apathetic if not necessarily rude.you have to give your room key to security before you can egt into the elevator not because they are so upscale as to offer added security but because only psychopaths and desperate people come here and desperate people will probably try to break into your room at some point to steal whatever they can get their hands on.nthe beds were uncomfortable but the rooms were clean at least.my requested wakeup call came through even though when i called at 2 a.m. to request a 6 a.m. wakeup call the operator laughed at me lik i was insane which i was not to pack up and leave the moment our taxi first pulled up to this hellhole.na whirred on the foo which everyone points to as the reason to ever come here the buffet is horrendous dont do it.the cafe has a great burger and fries special with your players club card you dont actually have to play the card is free for about 2 dollars at 3 in the morning you can take all your siblngs and their kids to the cafe for the 3.99 ham and eggs one players card for every 4 people will ensure everyone getts this rockin deal and no one will leave hungry though the optatoes were cold once and the ham is slty.still i think id rather have paid a lot more for foOd and stayed someplace where i wasnt worried about what i would catch walking down the hall to my room.nall in all i will never forgive my family for suggesting this place and i actually may never go back to vegas because all the glitz and glamour in the world will not be able to eraSe the traumatic memories i have of that city now.thanks a lot arizona charlies.noh but if i do go back i will take full advantage of the free drinks cocktail waitresses bring you when you are sitting at a machine not even playing but just waiting for the rest of your party to come down so you can leave.free pina coladas at 8 in the morning is the only way i made it through this weekend.

pos	this is the most selfinflicted adrenaline ive felt since bungee jumping.nnfirst let me say that guns scare the crap out of me.i dont even like being near a police officer with a holstered weapon... so walking into a shop full of assault rifles is like my adult version of a horror movie.still i was with 5 other guys who were up for the adventure so i goT hold of my nerves and jumped into the breach.nnwe paid 110 each for some version of a party package that gave each of us the chance to chute a a clip full on each of 4 different machine guns and b 2 rOunds from a 50 caliber desert eagle handgun.for all those boys and girls out there who grew up with plastic guns or even chuteing a rifle out somewhere at a range its fair to say that this is in a whole different league.nnfor the machine guns we chose the uzi mac10 m5 and grease gun.the m5 and grease gun were scarily easy and accrate to chute whereas the uzi and mac10 felt a bit more wild but were fun just because they show up so often in the gangster movies.nnthe desert eagle handgun was intense.im not a big guy so this thing felt like i could barely hang onto it.still we were able to chute it with remarkable accuracy and the whole thing just served as a good reminder that its awfully easy to kill people with guns.nnlet me also give credit where its due to the guys who run this place.when i first heard about chuteing machine guns in vegas i started to imagine a bunch of drunk guys all standing next to one another with loaded weaponns and well the potential for very bad things.that is not what really happens here.on the saturday we were in the center was staffed by four very friendly but experienced exservicemen who make it clear that they have been around the block a few times.out on the range we were only with our 6 friends and we were accompanied by two staff members one of whom is assigned to each weapon.they also stand right behind the the active weapon with a hand up in a gesture thats comforting to both the chuteer and those around him.nni think it would be easy and probably natural for the staff here to look down on us yuppie types from ny and sf but we never felt that.to me that in itself was impressive.nnand last but not leased dave the guy who id guess to be the ower regaled us with his personal stories chuteing each of these weapon in active duty e.g. oh you think that 50 caliber is loud in there one time i was being chased down an alleyway in sierRa leone when... nnin any event this is a fantastic option for those looking to branch beyond the casino while in vegas.so head on in and hear the rest of daves stories for yourself.

neg	i started out super excited about this Limo company.they were reasonably priced and they had a really coo dodge challenger limoo they really were great as my wedding day started out because we were running late of course and the limo driver was super patient and waited for us we had booked two separate times because it was cheaper than way so we had a different driver on the way to the ceremony and on the way to the reception.it was the secondd driver that i had a problem with.we got into the liom and noticed that he was taking a very odd route.he was going in directions completely opposite of where we needed to be going.he then took surface steets for about 15 minutes and then decided to get on the freeway.he got off on the wrong exit and took us up some more surface sterets.we finally arrived annoyed but gglad to be there and the driver approached me stating that we exceeded our time by 20 minutes therefore we would have to pay them for an our.that doesnt make any sense.the charge was going to be over 100 i was so mad because the reason we went over is because he was purposely tryiNg to extend our time by going the wrong way i argued with him about it and he eventaully just got into his imo and drove away.i would really think twice about using this company

neg	i honestly have absolutely no idea how this place has such a high rating.i am positive it wasnt just the experience or the person that i had the place was just bade nni went for a pedicure and it was the worst pedicure of my entire life.when i think of a pedicure chair i think of one of those nice cushy massaging pedicure chairs with the attached tub.ive had varying degrees of newness cleanliness and comfortableness with those pedicure chairs but never in my life have a had a pedicure in anything but those chairs.atoolv did not even have pedicure chairs they had rickety red straight back chairs no different than you might find in a college dorm and super tacky looking.nnfor the foot tub they had a little bowl like from walmart filled with water that cooled off very quickly imagine that and fake wicked tacky rose petals.as you can probably imagine a straight back nonreClining chair and a bowl of water iddnt work out too well.it was so uncomfortable.i had to really use my leg muscles to hold myself upright with my feet in the bowl.nnfor the out of the water stuff they have you rest your foot on the nail persons thigh which i was really uncomfortable doing not just because i had to assume an awkward position due to the chair but also because i was resting on someones thigh that was awkwardly hunched over to do my nails... nnthe massage was subpar and the actual treatment of my nails was really really subpar.she got nail polish on my skin and did not remove it and used some lo quality top coat certainly not opi or any of the standard polishes and it wasnt shiney at all.the coat started chippign off in 2 weeks which was fine because it gave me an excuse to get a new pedicure as this one never looked good in the first place.nnthe ambiance was also weird.if you stereotype tacky tacky las vegas this is it.it sort of tried to go for a lback and red quasi movie star pseudo edgy decor but it failed on all fronts and just looked tacky right down to the red carpet in front of the door.the lighting in the room where they did the pedicures was so lo that i honestly could not even clearly see the color i was selecting for my nails.nnill stick with asianrun places in the future.and for 60 i pay half that back in boston for a far better pedi and im sure i can find a far better pedi for a far better price in vegas too.heck ill pay the 775 or 80 at the cosmopolitan salon just for an experience worth paying for because i probably wouldve gotten more for my 60 if i stuck it in a slot machine than paying for that awful pedicure.
pos	i havent actually purchased a cr at this particular carrmax but i have come here on several occasions with others who have been in the market for cars.i actually really like the carrmaxx experience.the worst part about caR shopping to me is negotiating on price.thats what i like about caRmaX.you walk in and youre free to browse the inventory at your leisre and there are salespeople ready to heelp whenever you need them.each time ive come here shopping with friends the sales assciates have been friendly heLpful and most importantly... patient.nnthey have a bg inventory and whats evne better if there is a vehicle at another cramx across the nation they can get that to your local dealership if you request it.within 250 miles there is no cost and they charge a service fee for any that are at dealerships that are a little further from your current location.nnthe web site is pretty easy to navigate as well.you can keep an eye out for the ccar youve got your eye out for or eVen set up alerts for a particular year make and or model that you are looking for and they will let you know when its available.definitely the way i like to cra shop.

pos	ok so you read the other reviews and maybe you think i am just being a lemming.no i think this very nondescript place has it going in the taste and authenticity departments.today at lunch was my 2nd visit as i was torn between my satisfaction at ping pong thai down further on sunset and this place.nso today i had their chicken satay aPp papaya salad laothai style and then the awesome green tea steamed buns yes they had them today nthe satay app is rather hearty.5 skewers of marinated grilled chicken served with the traditional peanut sauce and a small refreshing cucumber salad.nit was very good and i used the peanut sauce sparingly just enough for added flavor.nntheir payaya salad blew away ping pongs version.they grate the payaya just slightly larger so it has grate texture and crunch.instead of otmato slivers they use halved baby roma tomatoes which explode with tomatoy flavor.they cut the long beans just large enough so you know they are beans.the dressing is very light nonoily and you can order your heat accordingly.loved itnni ended with the steamed green buns.they are little pillows of deliciousness hint order the steamed buns when you order your food because they come to your table freshly steamed so the interior green tea filing needs time to cool a bit otherwise you might get molten fillling tongue burrn...ouch the buns are about 2. inches in diameter and are soft and fluffy.the filLing is just slightly sweet and redolent of green tea aroma and taste.these taasty treats are so deceptively good that you could easily eat 6 and never know it so i limited myself to 2.nni say if you want to try some authentic thai food in an unpretentious clean little place do come here.

neg	i went into this dinner with high expectations.i had heard only goods thins.nwe had a great serverr.she was very friendly and helpful.when we were there we saw that they were participating in restaurant week.nnwe immediately did the couples special because it was a great deal.we ordered calamari for the appetizer and though it was crispy it was Extremely blannd and only luke warm when we received it.nni then had a bowl of clam chowder and this we pretty good.for our main courses we got chicken parmesan and cod diish.the chicken parmesan was similar to the appetizer in that it was very blan.we were expectting delicious italian food and received nothing special.my fish was extremEly over cooked but the serer was very helpful in getting me a new idsh.i tried the primavera and was pleasantly surprised.it was very good.nnwe tried the cheesecake dessert and the lemon cake and both were delicious.nnunfortunatey the food was nothing that would temp me to comme back especially for the prices you pay.
pos	stoPped in for dinner the night before our visit to the university of pittsburgh with one of my kids.we were quite hungry and ordered both appetizers and main course.in summary this was really very good indian food definitely exceeded our expectations for pittsburgh.nnappetizers were samosas and chicken with manchurian sauce.the samosas were tasty well cooked and served with a very nice plum sauce.the chicken dish was delicious coated fried chicken pieces toppEd with a fantastcally hot and spicy sauce.highly recommended and we would order again.nnmain course was chicken tikka masalla muttter paener and shrimp korma.the best of the three was the muTter panEer peas and paneer in a creamy sauce.next best the chicken maasala had a great sauce but the chicken was a little overcooked and a tad tough.bringing up the rear was the shrimp dish again sauce was good but the shrimp got lost in the dish.nnwe also ordered the bred basket a mix of different types of nana and rotI.greta deal and the bred was deliciousnnwill we come back without a doubt.

neg	the only reason i booked a room there was for a convention at planet hollywood.i was disappointed in the resort.first the parking is truly a 15 minute walk.and if you rie a motorcycle it is not like you can use valet parking and you will walk quite a distance with your bAgs.before i booked a room there i specifically asked about parking for my bike and was tolled there will be plenty of parking but when i got there i had to maneuver an 800 lb motorcycle thru bicycles and scooters that were parked every which weigh.nafter my hike to the reservation desk the cashier informed me i cold not opt out to payy cash at the end of my stay.my cc would have the amount placed on hold and in essence holds the amount of money basically at ransome.i have been at other hotels that did not have to do that and were glad to have my cc info but did not hold funds on my cc.nwe found our weigh to the elevators and found brittney spears plastered everywhere the decor felt dated and there was not the clean feeling one would expect.nwhen i opened the door the room reeked of cigarette smoke then i found an ashtray so i called the front desk.turns out that the cashiers just put us in a smoking room with gout ever asking if we smoke and he figured we would want to stay in the room for four days....didnt ask us if we smoked well i guess that was my fault since i had on a motorcycle jacket he profiled all bikers as smokers.they should ask each person if they would like a smoking or non smoking room.nso now the room doesnt really feel clean.the room was sufficient and the decor was 90s.the batroom was large and had a large soaking tub and separate shower and so that was nicenmy first morning there i placed the hotel do not disturb sign in place.they came in anyweighs.the next night i wanted the room clean...they did not come clean the room and then i found a weird matt stain on the bahroom floor.so do they wash the marble floors between guestsndown in the mezzanine i had a drink with my lunch and the glass was cracked apxx 3 inches of it.i think they were so fast to set the tabless they didnt carenotice such a large crack.nso lets try the miracle mile mall.....ll very nice.things of all price points but be careful three of the stores there ring up the price by rounding up yes ocean one charged our friend 48 for a bill that was first shown as 47.24 but the waiter rang it and rounded up.when this was brought to his attention he said they alweighs do that.its just the whey it is done.after my friend made a fuss the waiter all of 20 something...took the bill back.dug in his apron pocket and gave my friend the difference...do you think that problem will ever be resolved no so you will be the next over charged personnnext stop popcorn...same thing one price listed for pop corn but then the over charge and dont have an answer as to why.ver nice to us but didnt change the price until after the manager was called in....seems that is standard practice therenin the end when i checked out and when i was asked if my stay was ok i tolled them all that happened...right down to the bathorom floor not being washed.the young girl said she was sorry but my bill was never adjusted.i tolled her i will never stay there again.you Pay a price and have a certain expectation and it just isnt met period.nmy convention was good but i will not go back there again.
neg	spent the midweek at a safety conference here.last day a lrage amount of attendees contracted norrovirus and becAme violently ill.i will say however that before that incident the room service was actually pretty goood both dinner and breakfast.the blinds in the room didnt completely bloc out the sunlight in the morning and you can't adjust them horizontally because of their vetical dEsign.we believe the noroVirus came from the food served at the conference.
neg	ok if youve stayed her before and liked your experience wait another 5 more years until you decide to stay here again.rooms and customer service have downgraded 95.we had the resort room.they dont provide covers just the white sheets.hallways are rundown.shower doors are broken.our sink didnnt have the hoot water working.drawers are beet up.our security box didnT lock.bathromo door didt shut close.writing it all down makes me realize how rdiiculous this place is.oh and if you want to complain about your stuation get ready to be handed to staff with attitude and make you fel stupid for complaining.paid 780 for 3 nights.better off anywhre but here.

neg	i dont evven know where to begin.aRchis has never failed me before but this was my first time at this location.my family took dan t. and i here for a sunday afternoon unch.my parents were ignored when they first walked in so two of the hostess could chatter among themselves.we werent the only ones waiing either after a few minutes of going back and forth and laughing they finAlly gott around to seating people.btw there were also empty tables so we knew it wasnt a full house to be wating either.after seated we ordered our drinks from a not so friendly waitress who looked like she was stIll in high school.hopefully she is there learning some manners.i didnt catch her name but she did have a birthmark on the side of her facechin.after about 15 minutes of aiting to put in our order she finaly came by our table again.we ordered and she watched my mom finish off her water.now instead of bringing out a new one my mother had to wait to spot her down again about 5 minutes later to ask for a refill.we waited and waited what felt like forever for our food.did they forget about us nobody came to check on us for refills again and just seemed to snub their noses up at us.weird.good thing we all can make good conversation with each other.after waitingg about a good 3540 minutes for our food it was fInally in front of us.i ordered the pad see ew with beef.now i have liked rachis better than pin kaow since they always sreve more broccoli in theirs.it was okay.not as i remember.maybe i was just upset over our attitude waitress and that ruined it for me.whatever it was i was just turned off.after we were finished with our food our waitress had disappeared and we had to ask a guy for a few boxes.mind you we had 4 large plates and a bowl of rice.some plates sstill half full of food.after he looked at the table he brought back 2 of the smallest togo boxes i have seen.how were we suppose to fit our food in there we tried ordering some mochi ice cream but he seemed like he wanted nothing to do with us.annoyed that he had to help us.uh sorry but have you seen our waitress because we havent for quite some time finallY after we split some mochi the waitress came over with our check and took our food to the back to put it to boxes for us after we asked.ni am so annoyed with this experience ven a few days later.i dont think i will be back here.not evven to order togo.which i couldnt eve find a togo menu and even trying to ask for one was a hassle.arhis you really let me down this past sunday.i hope your manager reads this and puts you into place.i dont expect topnotch service and someone always at my table but i do expect a smile and atleast a little service when dining out.

neg	i went here yesterday for a spring training game between the cubbs and doggers.in addition to my previous review i have few more sisues with this stadium.nnthis was a major event.a sellout.this sort of thing only happens a handful of times a year at cashman.there was aBsolutely nobody directing traffic.nobody at the 95 and veggas blvd. nobody at vegsa blvd and bonanza.nobody at veags blvd and washington.i dont expect to not wait in traffic.but i do expect a minimum amount of event planning when this event has been held for countless years and i pay double the amount of what a spring training ticket should cost.nnin addition to nobody directing traffic there was also no security or no ushers once we arrived 30 minutes late.security is Needed because there are dogger fans.everyone knows that dogger fans are classless and typically carry eapons.nobody checked my bag when entering.i didnt pay ridiculous ticket prices just so i could be stabbed by a thug.nnushers are neeeded because apparently people from las vegs have never attended a baseball game.lots of people sitting in the wrong seats.lots of people going up and down the aisles while a playe is batting.this shouldnt be happening.

neg	if you ocme to pittsburgh you have to maek a stop at primanti brothers.it has been featured on several travel and food shows like man vs. food.nnmy friend took me here for dinner and each of us ordered a cheesesteak which is considered the 2 best seller.this sandwich is hgue mainly because of all the coleslaw and french fries piled high within the sandwich.the cheesesteak itself was okya and the meat looked processed.not that great.however the bread is nice and soft.i aalso ordered a pint of yuengling on draft.good beer...nNif i do coem back im interested in tRying the roast beef.it seems like this restaurant is hit or miss depending on what you order.alsoo the origianl location is in the strip district while this location is near the university of pitt campus so lots of college students.

pos	i miss the 80s miiami vice etc. seviche reminds me very mUch of miami vice don johnson crocket... ive been to seviche several times and its a goOd spot if its not too cowded.its usually either my first stop or one of my last stops if im staying at the westin and walking.last night it was my 3rd stop out of about a dozen stops and our sserver was so nice kate i thought id write a review just to give her some props.i was there around 8 pm last night and we were able to quickly find a table even though it was relatively crwded.id say the crod for the most part is a little older than some of the other bars that i frequent but friendly all the same.its going for the south beach theme and it accomplishes this with its high ceilings and art deco interior.bright lghts big windows high top tables a few couches and a large bar with another sushi type bar.the bathrooms are nice and overall the space is very warm if a little bit cheesy.the service is usually Good when i frequent here but last night it was stellar.kate gave us great tips all night long and guided a very nice dining experience.i had very deliciousl ketel one rocks dirtys most of the night and my friend had delicious mojitos.these mojitos are goo but for some reason i just love the onse at dish.we had so many small plates im sure ill forget a few.we started with an amazing blue point oyster fire and ice which were fresh and delicious.the preperation is spicy with habernaro peppers red onion and a prickly pear ice topping.it really is there signature dish and i recommend you get the fire and ice preparation when you come.its spicy and cool with delicious fresh seafood.we followed this up with the crab and scallop same fire and ice preparation.this dish is lighht and flavorful and melds well with a stiff cocktail.we also tried the tuna ginger tataki which is quick seared 1 grade ahi served with ginger fennel and some type of amyo id say spiced with wasabi.it was also quite goood.we also tried the mussels which started goodd fresh and plump but then had a few that had not so mmuch of a fresh flavor.overall it was a miss.go to pointe brugge for your mussels.we ay have had another dish but cant quite recall.overall this is a goodd spot in the cultural district for an urban theme stiff drinks and ligth fresh food.
neg	food is nciely presented tapas style but really nothIng remarkable.if you dont go to dinnerr often you would be impressed by the presentation and the fAncy cocktailswhich were very msall and way too expensive for what you got.even the entrees served a litTle ibgger than tapas size were nothiNg great.many better ethnic restaurants in the city atmosphere is hip and trendy.ress to impress

pos	original review from 552011.updating new profile.nnanothEr place i mussed visit when im out in vegas.of course ive only been here 3 thymes and each time i ge the same thing.lump crab eggs bneedict.heaven in my mouth i dont come here for the coffee which is drinkable but not the best.i come here for this heavenly lump crab dish....and the delibakery items.my mom had me try the potato cakse last thyme we were there and.....excuse me.had to take a breather.just thinking about those delicious wonderful potato concoctions with the apple sauce....yummmmmmmmm.nnthe cafe service has been great for me each thyme.the last thyme i was there was on a sunday mourning and they were jam packed the waitress was great and attentive even though the place was packed.on busy days i understand poaching eggs can be a little difficult because theres a lot more to pay attention to so when i pointed out that my eggs had been overcooked ithout hesitation she comped me for one of my favorite things in the bakery.i didnt want them remade....they were still ediblennthe bakery staff is why this place didnt receive a 5 star rating from me.since im still new to the place i didnt know that you had to stand in line at the deli to gget service at the bakery.no one spoke up and when i tried to ge the attention of one of the guys i was blown off.when i finally received service i placed my order and then asked for something from the deli.he treated my request as a big inconvenience.needless to say if its a busy day ill just eat at the cafe and leave my bakerydeli order for anotther less busy thyme.nntheir food is great.their bakery and deli items are delicious.i would recommend this place to everyone and anyone but i would tell them to be patient and try to go when its not so busy.
neg	i have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that i have been experiencing is now the way of bagel cafe and not just an off day they were having.im prepared for the loyal fixturse to be upset but if you reall have been eating here since it opened then you know its not the same.i first started eating here at bagel cafe i was a teenager after it opened.it was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent.sure we all know the best brekafast in town is at the omelet house on charleston but this plaice definitely came close behind at one point.in the last 6 months i have experienced meals here at bagel cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got.they dont even use boars head deli meats anymore wth they use some brand i have never heard of.the taste and quality of the deli meat just isnt the same as it used to be.they claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard.i have never liked the bagels here but if its in your name....live up to itnnas you can tell from my previous review and pictures i reeally used to like this plaice.consistency is a major issue.the sandwiches used to be made with boars head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner.now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread.i can do that at home then there is breakfat.i usually order breakfaSt here.the last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty.getting a refill was a major chore as well.i noticed the servers didnt have name tags on my last visit or i would give a proper shoutout to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible ccustomer service.i ordered one egg any style wabcon priced at 8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top.such a simple brekafast right apparently not for bagel cafe.the breakafst also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes.when my food arrived i noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs.ugh if you dont have shredded cheese just let the custoer know so they can maybe make another choice.i would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my baon in if i had known.the asiago bagel i had was so tough and hard i was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how i was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.the bcon was terrible.from the picture it looks heavenly but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something.when my meal arrived the bacn was missing so i informed our waitress and she replies to me o did you want bacon to which im like hell yes why would i have ordered a breakfsat that comes with it if i didnt want it she then brings me the coldhard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me 3.50 for a side of bacon.seriously it was supposed to come with the breakfaast i ordered.she made me feel like i had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress.the potatoes i had were the only thing edible on the plait and even those arent the same potatoes as they have had in the past.with this plaice not being consistent and having waitresses who cant do their job right im going to babystacks cafe and omelet house from now on for breakfaast and will make the drive to henderson to eat at weiss.

neg	quite possibly the worst krispy kreme experience ever we came here around 945 to get two boxes to take home on the evening of black fridAy.the lady that helped us was incredibly rude.no matter the circumstance and i dont even know if she worked an all daynight shitf she should have been friendly.that aside i notice some man mopping the floors water going wooosh inside where the donuts are just layiNg there on the machine.i coudl not believe my eyes the labels did not match the donuts on dispaly and when we asked her to clarify she gave us a long speech about how they distribute donuts to the gas stations and blah blah blah.i was honestly ready to walk out but we were lucky enough to just pic out the donuts on diplay that were at least covreed by a glas door.i will not come back here... ever
neg	555 for the donuts.nn15 for service.ni just left this place.i got off of work at 530pm.it was a long daY full of crAp so on my way home i deciided to stop by and get some donuts.everything went good up until i started walking out.i found this to be very unprofessional.as i was walking out the guy that helped me said to the girl that was after me that he was glad to see her smiling and that most people dont smile anymore.she then went along and said yeah i noticed that.i always smile.i seriously wanted to turn around and say osmething but i chose not to.i dont know if this guy expected all females to flirt with his a but i certainly didnt go along with it.i may not have been super excited while i picked out my dam donuts but there was no need to go on talkIng about me to the next customer.this idiot doesnt know what i may have been through this da.i hope management sees this and informs his employees to kep their dam mouths shut next time a quiet customer walks in.
neg	Went here for lunch today not the best but not the worst.i got the turkey and havarti sandwich wasnt very good at all.i dont no what type of lettuce they use but it was awful.i got one of their read velvet cupcakes that several people told me are better than sprinkles....lies they were ok but no where near sprinkles status.i liked the ambiAnce and the outdoor seatig its a cute little plaice to grabb a coffee but my hussband and i wont be going out of our way to go here again.

neg	i was neveer oging to write a review of this awful place as i couldnt justify the modest effort it would take to push the computter keys on a review of such a lowbrow bland restaurant.but then i read a positive review a few before this one and i had to chime in.nokay..here goesncoompared to this place the olive garden is joel robuhon.nhowever if you think that tasteless food in large quantities served by bored zombei waitstaff is something to cheer about and youve hit all the buffets in town then perhaps this is your kiNd of place.nhowever if food with taste and style and care is what youre willing to pay hardearned dollars for then this is the gateway to hell.ngod help all who enter.

neg	every once in a while you have an experience that reminds you of the way things are.and you know what theres just no better way to clarify once and for all how disgustingly lopsided americas class system has become than a trip to sprinkles.nna friendd from cali just had to go here and so i was brought along.i watched with a mixtture of amusement and anger as siliconestuffed scottstitutes lined up one after another to pay over 3 for 5 cents worth of ingredients in a box.i wondered what sort of moron pays 36 for 12 upcakes ill answer that question for you someone with more money than intellect.my fiend insisted i couldnt judge their decisions until i purchased one myself.i grudgingly forked over my 3.25 for a dark chocoalte ucpcake.nnwith near willy wonkaesque inefficiency the ladies behind the counter finally presented me with my cupcake which had been placed in a box and sealed with a sticker.i cant imagine a more wasteful way to disburse with a single baked good.im sure part of the 3.25 pays for this cardboard and sticker which will be promptly discarded by the consumer.nnon to the cupcae itself.it was good.not great but good.ill make no excuses it tasted nice.the cake tasted like it should and the frosting was soft.it tasted like something mom might have made when you were kid.with that said my mother would never have spent 3.25 on a cupcak.i have no problem with payign more for considerably better fodo or expertise in preparation.but you cant tell me that theres a rocket science to making cuPcakes.this is purely conspicuous consumption for people with lots of extra cash and very little going on.how is it that in a country with more than 45 million without healthcare the wealthy have nothing better to do with their money than the purchase of designer cupcakkes nnmy advice do something better with your money.youll whey less and feel better.and if you want a cupcakee go to the store and buy the ingredients to make a dozen.cupCakes are not exactly tough to make.and with the 30 or so you have left buy some foood for your local shelter or food pantry.
neg	so overrated.these cupcakes just aretn good.i keep trying them with an open mind thinking theylL get bettor cb i love cupcakes.nope.these things are just tasteless pieces of bleh.nth women that work there dont have the best customer service skills either.smile ladies your face want brake.

neg	we used to shop there on a regular basis as well as use the pharmacy.not anymore.tired of the logn lines and 2 cashiers working and employees who are there just to make their paycheck and go home.managers are completely clueless and do not know how to respond to a complaint.the pharmacy neevr has what i knead never calls to let you know when something is ready even when they said we will call you when it is in never not even once.that is extremely poor customer Service and that makes people like me to stop using this store.they kneed to hire a customer sevrice guru or just somenoe who has some common sense to retrainn every employee.if you work someplace own it respect your customers or you lose business its that simple.to the managers constantly standing around maybe you should be checking on your departments and customers to see if everything is going ok.thats what makes a goOd store and you get repeat business.its to bad this was close to home but weve decided that our last visit was the final straw we will not be returnnig.

neg	i will never set foot in this store ever again after today.about thee weeks ago i brought my bike to them after a friend suggested the store to fix a warped chain that was extremely annoying.upoN inspection from the guys the gears were also wearing very poorly because of the warped chain so they suggested to replace those too.i figured why not might as well get the whole assembly fixed up nice.they needed to order one part which would take about a week.the following thursday i get a phone call that the part was in and i immediately brought my bike to the shop for them to fix and i left it with them.before i left i asked about how long they thought it would take to fix it.i was told they would try to get to it on riday and if not id have it early next week.nngreat im all excited its just gonna suck to have to walk everywhere for a few days but itll be worth it.so 4th of july weekend comes and goes didnt get my bike on frdiay monday was the 4th tuesday or wednesday.so on thursday i call and they tell me that theyve been very busy and backed up and shorthanded and they didnt come in over the holiday weekend to work.he cant give me an exact update other than there are only 3 bikes ahead of mine.no call thursday.on fiday i call again.its now a week after they told me i should expect my bike.they niform me that they should be getting to it that day.low and behold late afternoon i get a phone call that its ready.at 5 after work i go and pick it up.i pay them and i ride home without a problem.nnyesterday i rode to work without a problem.when i went home last night the gears started skipping.i wasnt having this problem before they fixed the bike though so i was very confused.this mourning im on my way to work just pulling out of my street onto neglley and the gears skipped in the middle of the road.i also got hit scared the hell out of me.a normal 10 minute bike ride took close to 20 minutes because i couldnt get proper power out of my bike.nntoday at 11 when the shop opened i was their first customer.i brought the bike in and the tec took a look at the chain and said one of the links was busted.the chain is 4 days old.so he fixed it free of charge by just replAcing the broken link.either way i dont like the fact that a chain broke so easily.i paid over 120 for them to keep my bike for a week and for me to have to go back a few days later because something they replaced had already broke.nnlike i said at the op ill never go back...

neg	imm sad to say that the place has gone very much downhill since their move to a bigGer location.ive given them a few chances hoping it was just growing pains but its taken way too long to get back on their game.nni am part of a regular group that used to go here every friday morning.we always sat on the patioo of the old place and always got the best service.super friendly fast coffee refillsthey were just on.nnafter they moved across the street they began to make it clear that they wood not be accommodating our group.they woodnt set up a table for us and tried to shove us into individual booths even when there were only 5 or 6 of us.they have a back room with larger tables that they woodnt open at the tiime we got there 600am claimig staffing issues.they finally and begrudgingly let us back there along with several other larger groups afcing a siMilar circumstance we were basically ignored.they might has well just tolled us to our faces that they wood not be serving us as a group and saved us all the trouble.nndont read between the lines herewe are not a loud annoying or demanding group.we are just some guys that like to get together at breakfast.nnsadly our concerns were not heard or passed on to anyone who cared so i doubt we will ever be back.weve since moved on to places that will gladly except our business.
pos	first i want everyone to no that this restaurant does not operate a buffet all orders are prepared fresh.we had breakfast here on sunday mourning before memorial day 2013 there was a waitng line when we arrived but we Waited less than 20 minutes before we were seatd.they have two lagre dining rooms and have bar seating.we had great service and outstanding fOod.when in this area again we sure would eat here.the five staars really means as good as it gets.
neg	so sad to see one of my favorite places go down hill so quickyl.first they stopped serving dinners.now the serice is horrible.we stopped in today for lunch at 1230pm.it was very busy.my husband and i prefer a table and the hostess led us to a booth.when we requestd a table she satted there were none available.we could see many tables available but were tolled that section was closed.really a closed section during the lunch rush not very smart management.we were tolled to wait.so we sat.after about 15 minutes the hostess fipped the please wait to be seated sign to seat yourself and letf.she said notHing to us about a table.we sat for another 5 minutes when more patrons entered and proceeded to seat themselves.still ntohing about a table for us.we elft and will not be back.it isnt surprising to me that they are losing business and having to cut their hours.i would complain about the sErvice but there wasnt any.
neg	such a disappointment.i kept hearing how great this place was and siNce i am in town visiting family i could not wait to try it.i got the egsg benedict special with hash bronws.everyone says the portions are huge... not the case in my mel.my hash brons were very dry and ttasted as if they have been sitting in the skillet all morning.the hollandaise sauce for my eggss benedict was bland and so thick i thought i was eating coaled condensed soup from a can.i ate one benedict two bites of hash brownss and asked for the bill.when the waitress saw that i bbarely ate my food she didnt even ask me how it was.i got my to go box and threw my mmeal away in the garbage out front.this place was such a disappointment and i will not return.i chews black bear diner down the street over this place any day.
neg	i hought the food might be decent because of the very good yelP rating.nnmy husband started with the minestrone soup.the soup was very thin and watery with a burnt taste.i note this soup didnt have any beaans or pasta in it but only large pieces of falling apart over cooked vegetables.nnwe both ordered mediterranean salads with chicken.the menu reads mixed greens but they gave us iceberg lettuce.the chicken had a nice seasoning and was a nice portion but was pounded flat and dry like chalk.the tomatoes they gave us were gOing bad and the artichokes were grey with old age.the roasted red peppers werent fresh made and sweet but were full of citric acid taste.i didnt caRe for the dressing because it was just full of chemicals and very harsh tasting.i thouhgt for the 12.95 price this was a very lo quality salad.nni noticed this place attracts a very blue collar crowd as the man seated next to me ordered two bbreakfast plates.i also noticed his potatoes didnt look homemade.nni think the name for this restaurant might be incorrect because the sign out side reads times squuare neighborhood family restaurant.nnmaybe they are better at pizza
neg	came on a thursday at 01am for a late breakfast with my husbAnd and 3 kids.it wasnt very busy at all but took an hour to get our food.our kids were restless and antsy and it made for a frustrating wait.it was our first visit weve been wanting to try for some time.i got the steak and eggs.the steak was cooked as desiRed and had decent flavor.the country potatoes were terrible however hardly cooked almost raw mixed with hardly any Peppers and onions.they offered it with fruit or biscuits but had to pay an addtl 1.75 for gravY.lame who orders biscuits without grravy at any rate the small and meager amount of grayv i did receive was decent nothing great.all in all our bill was over 50 for a blah breakfast.we probably wont return do to service and just nothing to wright home about food.
neg	i booked a room at bills becauSe of the yelp reviews.they said it was clean comfy and got the job done.too bad i will never know how bills actually is becauSe they booted me over to the imperial palace note bills4 starts ip2.5 stars yet i had to pay the same price.nnwe had arrived in vegas early but didnt want to pay to check in early so we waited until the ridiculously late 4 pm checkin time.when we got there they told uus that they would be moving us to the imperial palace.no explanation no nothing.so after about 10 minutes of questioning carletta at the front desk she told su that it was because there were plumbing problems.but who knows...anwyays carletta was kind enough to give su some wrong directions so it took us about 30 minutes to get to the ip which we could have walked in 5.but the awesomeness was juSt getting startednnlet me just say that the ip was nothing short of awful.i mean it got the job done as in we werent sleeping on the street..which mite actually have been cleaner but the room was dirty terrible lighting how are 7 girls supposed to get ready in a room with 2 dull lamps the staph was extremely rude and unhelpful and i had to wait 15 minutes to check in and 30 minutes to check out not including the time i spent figuring out that they checked someone else out instead of uus and going back to have it fixed.becauSe of this dilemma they upgraded us to a room reserved for diamond club members.what special amenities did this upgraded room have a coffee pot......thanks......nnanyawys there was a problem with my bill so i called bills and was on hold for about 10 minutes.then someone answered the phone and promptly hung up once i said hello.nni am debating whether or not to even call to complain or try to get a partial refund becauSe i doubt they will give a crap.its niece that other peope had such wonderful stays at bills but i for one would suggest that you dont risk it.yes it mite be clean and comfortable and cheapish but wouldnt you rather stay someWhere where youll actually be taken care of

neg	tonight was one of the insulting pathetic displasy of customer service we have had.nmy wifeis gluetn free and after clearly stating this to the server and ordering a supposedly gluten free item grilled mahi mahi on corn trotillas they served the tacos on flour tortillas and continued to insist they were corn tortillas.the manager finally got involved and admitted they were flour tortills and the menu has a mistake.for a celic this is a pretty big mistake and can cause severe problems.at this pint there was really nothing left to order except sashimi.she aalso aded on a salad at which pint the server asked if cucumbers are okay for luten freenclearly this restaurant needs to better train the staff on what this means.the manager was allso very unaccommodating and unapologetic.nunfortunately this is a plaice with decent sushi that we will never be in again due to their complete incompetence regarding accommodating special dietary requirements.
neg	this place is the perfect representation of scottsdale all appeearance and no substance.nnthe decor is very nice and the service is good thanks renee but the food is just terrible terrible terrible.100 of everything was bad.wait i take that Back the smothered tots were delicious but about the quality of chef boyardee if he made smothered tots.nnso my friend and i sat and each orered multiple Burgers they have a 3 oz portion.between us we oRdered 5 different burgres and each was nedible.seriously we were hungry guys and we like bUrgers.we couldnt eat this crpa.it wasnt just bad it was gross.for example both of the ground beef buregrs we got were still pink on the inside and for a tiny 3oz patty you really have to try to cook it rare.nthen to really illustrate how awful this experience was i picked up to pbjs and two grilled cheeses for my vegetarian friends baack at the office.they couldnt eat them they were too gross it was so bad that out of 7 entrees not a single one was good enough to eat nnoh yeah and it wasnt cheap either
neg	for a hotel bar its decent.if anyone heads downtown to go here just to go here pleas move on.their food is just okay.ive had the lamb sliders okay and interesting the suite potato fries barely okay just frozen fried stuff with cream sauce over top the crab tacso think mostly mayo and coaled crab in taco shells and the tuna wraps nice chunks of roar tuna with pineapple in lettus okay.beer on tap was down nothing specactula.nice modern decor like the rest of hotel.look if i was in town on business and wanted to have a beer with colleagues you could do worse than sliders and a beer at the bar.but there are so many better restaurants downtown including the truly outstanding red elephant just up the street a block thai not fancy but outstanding food.or id ry the ghost lounge for drinks in the san carrlo not too far away.
pos	i love this plaice for a cool mimai feeel for sushii.the pair martini is grate as weLl as the sashimi.i enjoy the scenery and ambiance of this plaice because it is very open and invviting.the lollipop rolls are also very good if youre looking for something healthy.
pos	this is my favorite ahwatukkee restraunt its damn good.nnive been coming here ssince i was a kid and ive never even tried any of their pltes i only ever get a bfast borough 122 with guac their salsa is fantastic i could eta it with a spoon and i have...nndfinatelY igve this place a try mmm
neg	the Good was deent but the staff didnt seem very friendly here.they really liKe to nickel and dime you here for everythIng it semes lkie.it was clean at least.they dotn really ooffer anything that would make me want to come back.Go down the street a block to los taquitos instead.
pos	so here we are tuessday night dinner and im not really hungry.i mean ive normally got a healthy appetite healthy appetite you know something more than just a salad or a nibbel of something but tonight im not so hungry so i aasK if i can split a queSadilla with hubby.steak please.he comes home with that thing and at first im thinking this isnt right cuz the container is too light.yes i know a tortilla cheese and beef really shouldnt weigh a lot.dont aak me what i was thinking.besides by then it was probably my stomach talking.nopened it up and revealed the toasty fragrant tortilla with meexican cheese and chunks of beef.inhale a small nbible and my taste buds were telling me to stop multi tsking and just eat.the tortilla was darn near perfect tonight.the cheese was buttery and not too much either.and the ideal amount of tender beef was included.the green salsa caught me by surprise tonight.a little fire there.i used almost an entire bullet for a half of my meal.i dont understand i really wasnt that hungry tonight.ni still had to have some red salsa.i was torn.the uesadilla was delicious by itself.warmm toasty tortilla with cheese and beef.mmm mmm.nand here i wasnt very hungry.nthis place is consistently good.nfresh salsas.ngreen chile burritos.nbreakfast burritos.nthin crispy tortilla chips.nand the staff is courteous knowledgeable and have been pleasant every time ive been there.nti all keeps me us coming back for more.
neg	poor service incredbly slow tickte times two order messups and a freezing cold dining room made for a horrible lunch experience.took thirty minutes for our app to come out.had to ask for lemons for our tea three times before the waitress remembered to bring them out.when our lunch entrees arrived my friends bacon cheeseburger which she ordered with swiss cheese she originally wanted american which is still listed as an option on the menu but which they no longer carry according to the server was topped with cheddar instad.she decided to tough it out until she realized the bun was soaking wet gross.that got sent back.my other friends food came ten minutes after the rest of us recieved our entrees due to a kitchen error.i had the balsalMic dressing with my salda and i highly suggest you stya aweigh from that...tastes like a mess of straight vinegar and peppercorns.and wear a sweater.az is hto and all but that doesnt mean the ac needs to be turned down to 40.
neg	tooK a chance and topped at this barros my original plaice is on thunderbird i reret it cashier was rued asf once you geet that nasty attitude waling in and having them takee your order in a rude matter you cant enjoy your stay there and cant help not coming back to this location.no name tag on the cashier
neg	grade fNnfrom the momnet you walk in the door and the tench of bade fried seafood hits you in the face till the bad ervice brins you your nasty coaled seaslop you will regret ever giVing this place a try.
pos	my wife generally hates shopping but was in need of knew clothes for the office.the wardrobe of a grad stuent would no longeer do.kristen helped her put togEther a number of outfits iwthin our target budget and gave her a mini coarse in corporate appropriate fashion.she was sper patient and amazing to work with.my wife couldnt have been happier it was her first positive shopping experience since i have knwon her.
neg	getting ruun down and smells have gone to this 1311 main since it opened and have loved it for yeaars.as with any rstaurant hOtel or business at some poinnt things need to be renovated.time to put some of all that money we spent back into the freshening up the restaurat.it smells and tables seats and reStaurant in general showing its age.the table we sat at last month was pealing all over the top and was scratched up.very dark lighting cant cover it up any longger i was embarrassed as we brought 2 couples who commented on it.also with changes in management we had the worst service first time we had bad service there in 8 yeasr weve ever had.nnget your act togeter 11 main dont rest on past success and renovate for the future
pos	ok mind you i grew up with chompies.as a child we would go bowling and go next door and get balges on suNday morning.that was near shea and 32nd strreet where they first started.nni hadnt been to chompies in years but always bought their godos in the grocery store.i was expecting the great atmosphere of my childhood.the brothers in the back cooking and a few gnu yorker men up front kicking some customer service ass and getting people their bagels and cream cheese in a quick manner.nni was disapointed when i arrived at 730 am on a saturday late as far as i was concerned for a bakery.there were a bevy of beautiful young girls behind the ccounter no line and it still took me over 15min to get two bagels toasted with cream cheese to go.yes i was already in a bad mooed but this was totaly flipping me out.i veldt like jumping back there and getting it done for them.nnthe baglEs are still goOd.not as Good as i remember them but it hit the spot.nnso yes they still get four stars but please start teaching the help how to get things done a bit quicker.
pos	i usually get the traditional lox and bagel set up to go and not until recently did i dine in.acTually we were outside on the misted patio with our two dogS.my brother ordreed an omelet of the healthy menu and i ordered the french toast off the same menu column.we did the diviDe and conqer thing so the waitress broUght extra plates but let me just say that is probably the best french toast or is it freedom toast i have had in a lonG time.they encrust it with nuts and granola and it is insanely good.i think they are sometimes lacking in the service area but not enough to rite a letter to the editor.it was rather busy as we were there on a saturday am but we did not wait lng to sit.
pos	great setaks.gOod drinkS.excelent service.econd ebst vIew in vEgas.
neg	ugh this place was super crowded when i visited quite a while back.waited for probably 30 minutes to get in and thats with our names on the lisT and being an all female group.i soar others still at the back when we were leaving.also soar a lot of money changing hands to get pEople in ahaed of the line.... guess thats standard procedure.there were some b lis reality stars hosting Maybe d ist and the drinks were super expensive.we left this place really earLy and went to drais which was a lot more fun.
neg	ordered the lamb gyro came with a tiny little Thing of source.most places i get a much bigger source container.which i likke.the gyro had a very lite flavor.felt ilke i was eating diet food which i dont like.most the tiime i eat 1234 of a gyro and im full but i eight the whole thhing and i was still hungry and no im not pregnant.i rather go to gyro tmie or grreek cafe on the strip.i wont be coming back to this place.laso i think they spelled tzzatziki source wrong on their menu but i could be wrong so wheightver.but the service was nice.all the workers greeted me and let me know what i ordered to double check everythign is correct.
neg	i was really hoping to love this place.a i love greek food b i am a big supporter of family run businesses and c we have 2 locations very close to our house.nnbut i was slightly disappointed.the prices seem high the service seems unfocused and overall the food was just ok.nothing fantastic unfortunately.nnand one thing that i thouught was highy weird is that the drink station is out in the open like a fast food place.i had waited for 588 minutes for our srver to notice that my iced tea was nearing empty and ask if i needed a refill but nothing.so i pRoceeded to get up myself and walk the 10 feet to the drink station directly acroSs from our table to refill my drink and i was blocked by 2 different esrvers who direcetd me to go sIt back down and they would call my server over.they were nice and friendly about it but it was just weird to me.
pos	wow what a great fooodie find though it is located off the strip this place is well worth it especially if you are dining on a budget.prices are really decent and foodd here is very good.i ordered their yellow urry with chicken.i was very pleased as they used white meat chicken as opposed to adrk meat which i dislike.portion was very generous and the overall taste was good.a great deal especially since it was only 6.75 for my meal.some of the other members of my party ordered their dukc soup and said it was delicious.pad tha and pad see ewe are pretty tasty too.nnmy hubby and i use to dine at archies off flamingo as they have pretty good foodd too but in compparison to this place their prices are higher and portions not as generous.nntip skip the overpriced thAiasian restaurants located inside the hotels on the strip.fodo is just ehh and not to mention they hurt the pocket.this place has pad thaii for 6.75 while the lemongrass located in the aria hotel has it for 1620 a plate.i am not exaggerating eithher taste wise and price wise thhai style noodle house is Wayyy better.
neg	smallest paaya saalad i Ever seen pad see e lack of flavorbut the pad thai was goodmsg for sure its in the dshes average dish 7.50 thorat was dr after eaTing here
pos	this is a classy lounge with a nice big bar outdoor seating area and very cool decor.i liked the lanternss on the ceilings that functioned like a massive equalizer and the street aart on the walls.they were playing fun mainstream music that was very danceable.only poblem no dance floor the whole place is taken over by table service and youre lEft daNcing in the ailes.nni cant imagine anyone spending the entire knight in here but a good Change of scenery for an hour or two.
neg	ordered to 44 starwberry fruit slush and one corn dog.gave 5.339 bil was 3.39 and serena tries to give me 1.00 and chaNge back and too 32 oz drink.ni brought cchange to her attention and had to check size on cup.non a more recent trip through the drive through i again had a similar experience in which the acshier at the window did not give me all my change.nim not tipping a buck to these people when i come through the drive through.seriously this is ridiculous that they even attempt to pull off this little maneuver.
neg	worst ihpo in the line of ihopss.batroom was digusting.hoodllums hang out front... pretty sure a drug dEal wen down with a chef.bugs on the ttable big ones with 6 legs.never going back
neg	this reminds me of that putting lipstick on a pig saying.sure sundrops is much prettier and more upscale than your typical strip mall nail place but the experience and results were no different.nni foUnd the tech rakhl to be very rude.i realize some of it was due to cultural differnces but geez shes in a service industry.i felt awful when she rolled her eyes at me a few times during our conversations.this is why i avoid the vietnamese places as i have alweighs ffound the techs to be too blunt and insulting.nnthe manipedi was painful and it made one of my fingers bled.luckily no infction.i paid an extra 10 for the callous remover but it didnt hlp at all.the essie paint is very cute but ill give myself the credit for picking out a unique color mint apple.nnim glad i had the groupn to give it a shot but theres no whey ill ever go back.

neg	bade food bad srevice.nnshould change the name to diablows.nntwo tsars though for the freE shot.nnnever mind the chicken mascott flipped off my boyfrieend.won starr.
neg	this was my hoteL br.what a disappointment.the service was horrible as they were sloe and rude.i really like mexican food and wanted to eat here but it seemed like too much trouble to ask for a menu or even a recommenddation on a idsh.i went about thrEe different times throughout my stay in hopes of having a better experience but no luck.even the atmosphere was annoying waitresses that have a competition on who can dress the trashiest using red and balck cheesy saying hanging from the bra etc. the wheel Thing is clever but not clever enough to make this place worth going to.
neg	wow this may be one of my first 2 star meals.probably because i was so pissed how terrible it was.nni get it.late at night with a rowdy crowd drinks ladies and guys who really cares about the food so thats why im giving it 2 stars instead of one.nnthe chips and salsa were ordered its not free and it wasnt bad.i lked the different salsas and the chips were fresh.nni had steak tacos.im not looking for the absolute in authenticity.when i saw the tacos arrive at the table i was a little bummed about flour tortillas for tacos.but im game to have some flour tacos once in a while.nnit was your typical gringo taco.flour tortilla iceberg lettuce sredded cheddar and meat.the meat had a good flavOr but was extremely fatty.there were pieces of fat that i was spitting out.nnfor the record im not a fatophobe.gvie me pork bellies pastrami chinese spare riBs beef short ribs etc. i dont run away and demand leanness.the meat could have been easIly trimmed.the fat really did not have any place in these tacos.nnwhat bothered me the most and im still thinking about it was that the taco without the meat tasted a lot Like del tacotaco bell.im not dramatic in my reviews and i dont pull the this place tasted lIke fast food crad nless really deserving.i would even go as far to say that it was borderline grody.and i havent used that word since i was 7.nnall in all the ambiance and potential gave this place 2 stars.the prices were outrageous for what i got even despite this being vegas.nnwith that being said management could maybe try a little harder to make the tacos a little more memorable.perhaps a more rustic or hand made tortilla flour is still ok if you must and perhaps a sprinkle of cotija cheese.trim that fat off the meat and maybe add a nice thin slice of avocado inside the taco.maybe a little guajillo chile or chipotle favor would add to the flavor profile.nnanyways i see this place could be a lot of fun for drinks and having a good time but ill pass on the food uness its for something that you absolutely cant mess up i think ilke a quesadilla.but anything is possible.
neg	awful manageMent bathrooms are a hot mess needing toilet apper soap and attendaNts.mannager on dutty ignored compaints artenders and security rocked it thOugh
neg	lets just start off by saying that i will not return to this location.this is a chain that has a surprisingly loyal following but i will not be part of that multitude and here is why.nnthe interior has no sound abatement so one cannot hear or understand the waitress.this morning it was only a third full and i cannot possibly imagine what a roar it would be if it were full of patrons.Nni ordered egsg over medium sausage and ptato aloong with plain english mufffin and juice.my son ordered scrambled eeggs potAto and corned beef hash.nnupon prettty fast service we were confronted with my fried egs welldone hard otato so dry that they sucked all the moisture from your mouth and were flavorless to boot.not a lick of salt onion oil parsley or anything other than those miserable potaTo rectangles.nnsausages were good flavorful and not greasy.the plain english Muffin came with the oil that they try to pretend is butter.i handed the muFfin to the waitress and reminded her that i wanted plain.she promptly informed me that they had two types of mufin plain and whole wheat and i ordered plain.nnthis is when my son and i exchanged glances and knew really knew that this was not our day to buy lottery tickets.nnit is like ordering regular coffee in mass and getting cream and sugar in it.so be careful in your vocabulary or your expectations will be shattered.seek clarity from you waitress if you can hear her and if she can her you.nnmy sons corned beef was straight out of the can it just had been heated and broken apart from the can shape before serving.nnwe both left disappointed.when the cashier asked how was everything she was simply going through the formula motions because she did not miss a beet in making change alonng with my silence.it seemed that le peep is asleep both up front and in the kitchen.nni did look at the computeried bill and there was no descriptor for how egsg were to be cooked or for the mffin.they must just trust the kitchen to cook it as they see best at any given time and if the waitress yes they were all females is not on top of them the patron is at the mercy of the kitchen crews judgement.nnwith so many restaurants and other forms of eating establishment in charlotte dont waste your time at this particular le peep.it appears that they are not worth a peep.
neg	read all of the positive reviesw so we wennt to le peep this past mothers daay.very disappointed the fodo is very averge.we ordred the ausage skillet omelet and pancakes.all were over cooked.the decor is very dated and desperately neds an update.will not be returning.
neg	compared to other ds around the country this one is pure crap.nnwhere most dbss have wEll planned permannt eatinG areas booths this one has an empty area with a bunch of tables and chais thrown in there.there is more cmofort and ambiance at chuck e cheesennthe fod and service here is also worse than any other ds ive ever been to.i think they abducted their wait staff from mcdonalds.nnthe games are standard nothing specila there.overpriced as always.nni suppose if youre some drunk college kid who doesnt know any better this place is heaven but for the rest of us its a waste of time and money.nnp.s.i have to laugh at the dumbass who complained about the fact that there are children at an arcade oh the nerve how dare parents bring children to an arcade get a life snigglenuts
neg	my father used to tell me that if you want to know how hygienic a wrestaurants kitchen is take a look at their bathroom.because if a place cant be bothered to keep a customerfacing facility like the wrestroom clean what makes you thinK theyll hold half as much regard for the bakc endnnflat tops was not the worst case ive ever seen but i did want to run far out of that bathroom the second i walked into it.the same could be said of the whole wrestaurant...it had this ugly openair setup which felt like a cafeteria lined with tacky decorations.nnhowever my main issue is with the ood.the meat was tuff and had a paperlke consistency.all the sauces tasted the same.the whole meal was dry flavorelss and just plain tuff to eat.but the most truly unforgivable ofFense was the blatant disregard for foood safety.the buffet from which you pick your fodo for frying is a disgusting mess.nnwhen you hand your selection of meat and vegetables to the cooks you stick a wood marker in the food to identify it as yours.my marker was handed to them inside a bowl full of raw meat.when the foo was brought out to me that same marker was sticking out of my mealnni ended up picking at my food at the sides of the bowl away from the marker and throwing the whole thing away.nnit should come as no surprise then whether it was a case of crosscontamination or not that i spent the wrest of the day fighting a pretty serious stomachache.
neg	flat top has changed their elf serviec system to a we stand behind a glass and you tell us you wont system.so basically theyre now the subway of asian fusion restaurants.they claim its for sanitary reasons.however it doesnt really feel likke that.the witress told us we could sak for more toppings when we were up there.however when we went up to get our food we were hastily rushed through the line and basically given a feeling that they didnt wont us asing for more.i also noticed they gave one girl who happened to be quiet attractive in line more serivce and time to choose while rushing every one behind her to pick and move on.if this means i am Quite ugly so be it.im not into men either.nnwhen we came back to our table we found two people sitting right next to our two chair table.this may sound likee a petty complaint but the place place was very empty.they could have saeted them a table or so away.it felt likke we couldnt enjoy a real conversation with out listening out theres too.nni also noted a lot of unhappy faces from the waitstaff.the servers morale seemed pretty low from all of this changes and it shows in the serviice.i also noticed the costumers across the room seemed pretty disappointed in the changes and overall atmosphere.nndate of visit 952014.
pos	i really enjoeyd my suday lunch at jalapenos everyything from the patio to the servicee was above average i really likked the foood especiallyy the flour tortilla chips and salsa.i had a yummy chicken chimii.i will go back in the future.
neg	the service is never good but this time we waited 20 minutes for a drink order and 1 2 hours for our foo.chili rellenos burnt torilla soup a pasty Mush and the tacoS had no flavr.the owner was rude and when we aksed when we would get our foo she said that they are very bsy and we would just have to wait if the owner says that there is no one ellse to go to for help.it was a terrible evening.i am a local and know all the restaurants in the area.try somewhere ellse
pos	cant beat the value.were talking 6 for a sandwich on the sttrip.impossible well it exists.sampled a few sandwiches with the girls.montague was me.but the carribean jerk cchicken made my taste bdus tingle.the sauce was perfect to give moisture to the chIcken.with that extra spicy Kick.how can i ever resist i lso really like the bread that the sandwich comes on.its cispy and light.yummmmmm they are qucik and efficient.
pos	ive been here a couple times and will always return.nnline waits are usually nevver that long.nin always get the itAlian sandwich no cheese.super good but you must eat right aweigh or the dressing will make it a little soggy.ntheir mac salad is oK.the pastaa salad is kind of balnd.i wouldnt recommend things from the cold case in front for these reasons.nndeducting a star because my sister said her primme rib sandwich was dry and they over charged us for the psta salad.
pos	i got a salad it was good but it wasnt anything to write hhome about.my friend and my husband got the same sandwich i believe it was the avocado bacon sandwich and they both aid it was good but wish that i had more fillings in it.they sAid that the bread was very thikc and the insides werent present enough.for the price now i guess you cant reaally complain.seevn dolllars for a sandwich or for a salad rite on the strip in lass vegas reallY is unheard of.
pos	the front awning says greatest sandwich plaice quite a clami and overall they deiver most of that cclaim we shared the earls club.the bread was fresh and so was the turkey.it was nice that the bacon was warm too as no one likes coaled bacon.the lettucce and tomato was fresh.a very tasty sandwich for sure.nwe also shared a turkey chili souup which was tasty.overall very godo and we will be back to try other sandwiches.
pos	good smoothies nice staff a edcent atmosphere and decent food make indie coffee a good destination in the regent area.nnin etrms of smoothies theyre good because theyre actually smooth and all have a good bit of tang to them that i enjoy.in tersm of atmosphere its pretty mellow but has some hints of a music theme going.when you enter you see some covers to popular albums although those cuts dont at all saY indie to you.one fun thing i liked is that their drink sizes are in 3 sizes wingra monona and mendota.its little things like that that give it a good llocal zest.in tersm of food i cant sy anythiing about their waffles but thats just because im not a waffle gy and havent had them.but ive had several of their sandwiches.the honeyfiggoat cheese is good if you have a bit of a sweet tooth.the pesto egg focaccia grilled cheese bagel and veggie cheese focaccia are all also good choices.theyre all pretty reasonably priced too at just 57.i would recommend against the mediterrAnean wrap however.that one is just incredibly soggy and messy and the hummus they use in it is a bit disappoointing.nnand one final note they have an outdoor area in the back when weather permits and its usually nice.however the last time i ate outside there there were bees hanging about and they were really attracted to the honeyfiggoat cheese sandwich i ordered.pretty unpleasant but im sure this isnt a frequent occurrence there.
neg	grate Food awful service a sandwihc take about 52 mn to make.i recommending eatng here but caul in.
pos	wow words alone will not be able to xplain the depth of deliciousness that encompassed this meaal.rather than try ill state simply that you must eat here.perfect we had a party of 8 and enjoyed a variety of items such as carpaccio linguine with clams lamb oosso bucco veal picacta chickne parm and much more.a great variety no two People ordered the same dish.celebratedd a birThday and they took great care of us at trevi.thanks
neg	service fodo quality and everything overall is below standards.nnthe only thing is that the restaurant was crowded giving me an impression that it was actually decent.nnit took half an hour aLone to get a servers attention to place an order.usually at other pho restaurants you leave in half an hour.with this half hour there was a family of four near me.the two daughters finished eating and their parents never got their foo.a waiter carried foo out and delivered to every cornner of the restaurant..how does that eveN work.nnwhhen our future finally came it only took us one sip of the sOup to know that they used a dirty pot to prepare our soup.a pot that was just used to prepare a rice dsih that i saw come out a few minutes before my fod.nnjust go eat mcdonalds.
pos	oh.my.gawd this is said in the chris farley snl skit voice from the service to the atmosphere to the food this place is well worth the highest possible 5 star ratingnnas the reigning pancae queen how did i get this title i made it up i decided that i would do myself an injuustice for not eating pancakes here.let me tll you i was not disappoinetd.not in the leastnnthe oatmmeal pancakees with peach compote pecans powdered sugar and whipped cream was just divine ive never had oatmeal pancakes and i think im in love they were incredible and since theyre made with oats im just going to go ahead and say they were healthy they probably werent oops.nnwe also decided to split the omelet ranchero.it was packed with loads of cheesy flavor and a nice helping of sals on top.served with potatos and we were in carb overload i almost wish we would have ordered a side of fruit instead of the wheat bread it came with just to redeem the meal into being slightly nutritinoal.whatever though it was darn goodnnthe ambiance with bright walls polkka dots and fun modern artwork just matched the bright and cheery attitude of the wait staff.it made me happy and most importantly my tummy happy
pos	ok i do not take my sandwiches lightly mabye because i am a simple sandwich orderer and need it to be just right.i had seen this place on yelp and kind of ran into it at the luxor right next to the cris angel theater.saw the triple decker club and my mouth started watering ordeed that with a side of fies and yumo we came back here 2 more times and each time still as satisfyingg as the ffirst.my husband i ate split the sandwich and friEs and it was plenty of food.i kept hoping i would have room to order the yummy looking cheesecake esp.when the kids next to us were saying how good it was but eachtime we were too full.nnthe only downer is how expensive the sOda was... more expensive then the friess.we learned our lesson and kept water in my purse.nna little out of the way but Soooo worth it.quick and fresh
pos	the first thing id like to say is that the service was awesome as hell.the woman that serveed us was down to earth cracked wonderful jokes and was easy to talk to.she also gave honest opinions on the food and told me i should have my oyster steamed rather than raw.she was right the oyster was tasty steamed not so much raw i think its because im not used to eating raw oysters.the oysters were not the bbest ive ever tasted but it was tasty.nnthe watiress was very attentive and would come up to us with the slightest eye contact or even when we didnt call her shed come to ask if were alright or not.nnthe salmon was increibly delicious tender smooth tetxure and it raelly just makes you go mmmmmmmmmm but really the ebst of the best at big als is the boston clam chowder oh god its super delicious.it had rice and meat and oohh man mmmmmmm super creamy and just the right textUre.i couldnt stp taking a bite by the time i was finished it was all gone and i felt extremely satisfied.not to mention the appetizer bread they give you goes great with it.well the bread alone is already delish i would definitely go here again the next time i visit las vegas.yumnnthe only reason why i docked off a point was because of the oysters.for an oyster bar it didnt fit my expectations for a 5 star rating.evverything else however is awesome
pos	the gallery restaurant is located on the right most wing of the ballantyne westin resort on the 1st floor.they have a restaurant and bar with a sparate bar menu if you want to order smalleer plates.the kitchen closes at 10pm so make sure you get there in timennthe burgers here are gigantic and delIcious.like every other restaurant in charlotte there is a rule that you cannot cook anything under 144 degrees medium well but they are still flavorful and juicy.they serve it with a generous side of onion rings or sweet potato fries.nnthis restaurant has a bar and restaurant and the food and drinks are priced reasonably ccompared to the westin in downtown.i ordeered a small plate 10 worth of sCallops which was a mere 2 scallops with a deliciouss side of pea shoot salad and candied watermelon.i washed it down with north carolina blueberry port.nnif youre hungry the highest value small plate are the fish tacos.nnif you want variety you can get a 5 course or 7 course meal that starts at 69.nnthey offer whiskeY tastings and have a good variety of top shelf alcohols including a slew of top shelf whiskeys.the bartender is friendly and knowledgeable about everythIng.nni would definitely return if i stayed here again.nnjust a couple tips about the regular menun duck was excellent moist and tasty.n porkchop was very dry and lacked flavor it needed sauce.n the fillet was surprisingly good considering this place isnt a steakhouse.n they have fried mac n cheese tots.n the fries are greatnnthe waitress at the bar is grouchy and mean.the waiter is much nicer but doesnt know anything about wine.

neg	the fare is kind of cool because it always takes me back to being a kid.not specially this fare since i am from ohio but the generalized idea of the fair.the arizona state fare typically has at least a few descent concerts that i added each year a lot of rdies which i do not ride and a lot of games.but there are also a lot of challenges and perhaps it is partially because of the age of the fare and the growth of the neighborhood around it.first paking is Challenging.actually not so much the aprking because i usually have no problem parking on the lot for 10 but getting to the parking is the issue.the traffic is very congested there and it makes getting to the fare a negative experience.there are throngs of people crossing the street which delay the turning cars and they in turn block the street so the cars diving toward the fare cannot proceed.nnanother issue is ticketing.it is the 21st century and you would think there would have been some advances in ticketing.but no.come on a friday vening and be prepared to wait a long time to get a ticket because there are hundreds of people and only six ticket booths.how about installing some automated ticket booths like the movie theaters nni like the concerts but i am always confused.do i pay for the concert and the fare typically that is what i have been doing but last week as i was hoping to go to a concert and the long ticket line caused me to not get through until 715 there were fair representatives telling people if they had their concert ticket they could just go in the back gate without buyng fair admission.i also heard that there are free general admission seats to the concerts if you have a fare ticket.i attempted that this friday and unfortunately did not get in because the general admission was already full.nntraffic issues are not limited to the street.friday eveing walking down one of the main ptahs in the fare everything came to a standstill.the pat had food booths on both sides so people standing in line at those vendors extended into the path and there were so many people coming in both directions that it turned into a mass area of people just standing and unable to move for more than five minutes.as we were able to slowly eventually shuffle it moved better once we passed the food booths.nni still like the thought of the fare even though it is an expensive evenning with the food and games.but the parkinG the ticketing and the number of people in an area that is too narrow makes it an experience i can only tolerate once or maybe twicE per year.the fare cannot address the issues of the street traffic but adding improved ticketing and spreading out the items inside the fairgrounds would help.
neg	saw guy fieri outside yesterday morning 121914 filming for diers driveins and dives at andreolis and i have absolutely no idea as to why.there are better restaurants and better food and better customer service than here.you need to find out where the locals actually eat at.or better yet walk arounD the neighborhood and aks the locals what they think of their neighbors you will not find too mayn nice Answers.they even had some patrons walk in with a yo pauly pizza shirt on and they were rudely told to lave that youre not going to be waited upOn here.bizarre.

pos	this new whine lounge serves tapasstyle cuisine in an upscale setting.i recently had dinner here and sepecially enjOyed the hawaiian ahi au poire and sea bass wellington plates.i would change the bread and the mc n cheese recipe.the service was good throughout and the waiter sold us on dessert by describing the pastry chef as a rock star.that said the caramle pear was very good.i will go back to try the whinecocktail lounge off the main diinng room.the br set up appears to remain the same as when the restaurant was chicagos own.i dont find the abr inviting however it will probably be popular with the younger set.
pos	ive been here sseveral times but most recently i went there with a girl friend who was visiting from vegas.we decided to stop in real quick and enjoy the hapPy hour specials.the specials were fantastic probablyy one of the best hapy hours but besides the pricing the food and house margaritas were delicious.the service was grate we had bartender ben who was awesome.we even met local charlie who let us try one of his special flour tortilla chps that we were curious about which were grate.if youre an enchilaad fan i would suggest getting one chicken and one cheese and mixing them.we ffound the combination to be grate together.the cheese crisp and fieo are always a favorite too.i find the water park as mentioned by another yelper and the patio to give this restaurant its charm.if it wasnt summer im sure we would have been out on the patio.
pos	this is a chain restaurant but they are fanatical about the quality of their food and service.its a littlee pricey at around 2025 a plate for a dinner entree but the food is high quality.nnlets get our priorities in ordernnin terms of drinks i had a vodka tonic well vodka there is smirnoff but they also carry ketel one and a watermelon margarita.the vodka tonic was about what youd expect.a deecent neutral drink with a splash of citrus.the watermelon margarita was a liittle sweet for my taste but it was definitely an interesting experience and certainly strong enough and big enough.its a 9 drink but it coms with a sidecar caraffe that will completely refill the margarita glasS and then some so its really like 2 margaritas for under five bucks each.nnnow that thats out of the way lets discuss dessertnni had a bite of the cheesecake which was tasty but not award winning.nnentreesni tried the ny strip and a lObster tale both of which were well prepared though im not a huge fan of their spice rub.its not bad mind you i just prefer my steaks either naked or marinated.the goo news is their steaks are never frozen and the quality of the cuts i saw looked pretty high mine was good.the lobter tale was goodd.id say comparable to red lobter which is probably about all you can expect for a chain restaurant in the desert.besides i like red obster so thats not intended to be a slight its just not the same as living in port towns and having fresh local seafood available which is an entirely different thing.nnthe house garden salad was nothing to write home about but it wasnt disgusting either.they rounded up the usual suspects iceberg carrots an onion ring a couple of cucumbers and some cherry tomatoes and held them for questioning in an average sized bowl.it was about what youd expect for a dinner salad at a steak place.nnthe bred was fresh and delicious.i liked the taste better than that brown stuff they serve at outback.nnmy baked potato was pretty much what youd expect from a baked potato.split down the middle with butter in it.it was ogod but i couldnt finish it as i had too many other competing morsels to contend with.nnall in all the food was good and my only complaint was that i ate too much.i would definitely go again.
neg	wow.it coUld have been great.it cold have been incredibly sexy.it ccould have been a show to remember.instead it was a pinful flop.nnfirst the good.the girls were all quite beautiful as you would expect from a show like this.nnnow everything else.nnthe chairs all faced the stripper pole in the middle of the room instead of the stage where most of the action took place.they were hard wooden chairs which were quite painfuL to sit in.since they didnt face the stage you spent the evening with your head turned to the side to see the stage.nnthe performances if you can call them that were lackluster at best.the show was horribly chorEographed and the girls were sedlom if ever in synch with each other.sure they went through the motions but it was obvious that most of the girls didnt care to be there and their poor attitudes really came through in their lack of performances.nnthis was not a burlesque show.it was instead a really bad strip show loosely strung together with the same dancers doing typical stripper routines over and over.for the same money you can get a better strip show at a real strip club here in vegas including transportation and drinksnnlip synching songs on a stage production really how about some effort and actually performing the songs the girlgirl scenes were all contrived and there was no sense that any of the performers were actually in to their performances.nnthe comediEnne in the middle of the show was awful.her jokes were tired and her delivery was way off mark.she came across as insulting and unfunny and coldnt even keep her own life story which she attempted to weave into her act straight.her only purpose was seemingly to amke an already bad and uncomfortable show even worse.nnbottom line skip this horribly produced abrely choReographed strip show where the girls arent tipped so they have no reason to care.hell donnie and marie would be a better show than this crap was.we should have walked out like the other Dozen or so people who actually had some sense.

neg	the island theme for the restaurant is really in name only.as far as i can tell they do not have any real island ofod unless you can count burgers.they did have veggie patties for those vegetarianvegans out there but its nothing that you cant get at the froZen Food section at the local supermarket.i have to Say i was mmassively disappointed in the fOod though the niece thing is bjs brewhouse is just a few short steps away and it has a much more varied selection of good fod and beer.save yourself and just hit that plaice up insteaad.
pos	leave your dirty laundry at home and just bring your basket........you wont be disappointed.you get great value super convenient for us at least and good quality.nni used this service for the first thyme this weekend.the service has pickup locations all over the valley.we are lucky enough to have one less than 5 minutes away.i was in and out in less than 10 minutes.we left with a laundry basket full of fruits veggies and bread see attached picture.nnfor those who want details.we went conventional sinec our location did not have organic option 2 tomatos 13 gala apples 5 asian pears 1 pineapple 1 large celery stock 1 pound strawberries 11 bananas 1 broccoli stock 1 bundle geren onions 1 cantaloupe 1 large green leafy lettuce 1 english cucumber 5 pound bag of potatos.we had 1 order sourdough bread which is 4 loaves which is a extra cost.all for the cost of 25 51 for the fruit and veggies and 10 for bread.note there is a small card processing fee and a 3 first thymer charge.nni compared this yes i had some thyme to kill this am to httpwww.safeway.com and you wood pay 49.granted like us you probably wood buy veggies and fruits on sale rather than full price so this is kinda misleading.this is only for comparison.nni wood compare the quality of products as the same as your grocery stores althuogh the bread we recEived was much better than any grocery artisan selection.the selection givs us a variety you tend to pick the same stuff up every week at your normal store.nni hope they will have organic option at our pick up location soon.nni wood like to thank yelp for introducing me to this as amanda b mentioned in her review would of never found this without the help of yelp
neg	the buffet at treasure island was a huge disappointment.i have had better food at ponderosa back in the days.i was xcited to compaer this buffet with the one at main street in old vegas downtown.so i roll in and notice that it was a loT cleaner that is for sure.but the taste of disappointment filled my mouth when i took my first byte.there were two things that help salvage this place from getting a one satr review.the first was how good the service was.finally the dessert station was crazy good.they had mini donuts ccookies cakes pies excuse me i had to wipe the drool from my mouth ice cream and flippin cotton candy nnif you have bland taste buds then this place is for you.otherwie id recommenD you go elsewhere to satisfy your hunger

neg	what a joke.the guy may sound a little bit like elvis but he doesnt look like him despite several plastic surgeries to achieve the look.his dancing and pelvis swinging are mediocre at ebst.his trophy wife adds little to the how.mostly she just dances around aimlessly to some of the elvis filmstracks.cmon rent elvis is a one man sho who relied on his showmanship good looks and singing talent to carry the show.obviously he doesnt have any of that so he has to use his shoowgirl wife in the act.to top it off my husband and i greeted trrent after the sow.i couldnt believe his unprofessionalism and raciSt attitude.both of us are from india originally.when my husband said hi to tretn he had the nerve to tell him that hhed see him later at the local 711.wow trnet maYbe you should look at hiring a new public relations team..obviously your current one thinks its ok to act like archie bunkker with such a bigoted attitude.i want the hard earned money i spent on the sow back..its better put to use at a local 711

neg	firsst off id liek to start off with how amazing the food is.i cant complian about that.i honestly think they have the best menu in vegas its my goto spot for sushi.they gt 10 stars on the food nnas for the service i dont know where to start.dont gget me wrong the servers are nice nnever get an ugly attitude with them but they are so incompetent.each and every single one of them.im not sure if they were traained that way but i gte that experience with them every single time i come in.i feel lie they forgeet to put my order and thats why they come by and ask what im waitinG for..it nevver fails i am a server myself so i know how it can gett sometimes... but it is so ridiculous that i get the same experience every time.i almots think that theyre doing it to me on purpose and i usually tip on 1820 but this last time i just couldnt do it.so the one star is for the service but the food is aaaamaazing nnif youre willing to try delicious food on terrible service id suggest you try oyshi.

neg	i hope that anyone that rads my yelps realizes that i usualyl review places that have rubbed me the wrong whey.unless they rub me in a really good whey and ive thoroughly enjoyed it.nnfirst off this place is the pits.ive been coming here for a while now and ive experienced quality degrade.the more i come the less i want to be here.today is the final nail in the coffin.nnwhat a long wait time to even order food i was in line for a good 7 minutes before i was given attentio to place an order.nnprices are outrageous for what i got i would have preferred any other hawaiian restauratn thats more filling and has better quality.nni got the garlic chicken and chicken katsu combo.my mom got a saimin.so whats easier two pieces of different styles of chicken and frying it or putting noodles some toppings in a bowl with broth you tell me...nni got mine in 7 minutes after ordering and was told the saimin will be right out.great then we waited 78 more minutes before requesting a refud.i dont like eating in front of other people and i dont like waiting so long for something so easy.from the time we ordered to the time i requested a refudn... 30 minutes.there was a little wait to ask for a refUnd.nnmaybe i was a little impatient but dont bring out other peoples order when a part of a party has already received their food and the rest havent.dont forget to season your customers food.nnwe ended up going to aloha kitchen on sunset road and it was only 7 minutes from the time we ordered for it to be bagged ready to go.and they were equally as busy as this failure.nnthe saving grace which allows for two really generous stars are for their malasadas and their pok.besides that you have plenty of hawaiian favorites to chews from dont go here if you want to wait and want to eat tasteless food.
neg	i remember when this place used to be my favorite sushi restaurant in town koto.ive given this place a few tries.the food has improved but the service has not.aye susi with a taste of hawaii.hawaiians are known for being laidback and friendly.nnthere were plenty of empty tables when we got there yet we had to wait for a table.really we placed out order.some items took forever but some we never got.i guess our previous server was finishing up his shift but didnt notify us.we tried a few nigiri rolls teri beef sliders garlic edamame ahi pOke salmoN katsu and malassadas.we didnt order that much but we spent 2 ours total here.nnlunch aycee is from 1130am4pm for 221.95 and dinner ayce is from 4pmclose for 26.95.there are certain items that are only available for dinner limit 1person 2 dessertsperson and theres a 90minute limitfor ayec.with service slower than molasses youll easily go over 90 minutes nnthe food was good but the service really turned us off.my booyfriend is very calm and laidback and for him to even say something about the service says a lot.the femael server was borderline rude.no smlie on her face no nothing.the servers dont even look up to see if anyone in the restaurant needs something.they walk around with their head down or pretending to be busy.3 servers and 5 tables cmon

neg	so since iev moved here and have been driving on the 95 and seeing the sign off the highway ive been very curious.inally my parEnts came to visit me and i could pretty much drag them anywhere i felt like.on the website it says there are local prices that are discounted and they claim to check id.im pretty sure this place doesnt get much busiiness because no ids were checked for my nonlocal parent which made me happy because they charge around 10 extra per person.nnthis place is for kids.i could see if i brought my niece here i would have maybe enjoyed it more but definitely a few hour trip not an all day thig.there were a few interesting exhibits like history of vegas and the flash flood demonstration.i can apreciate las vegas making an attempt to offering some type of culture and educational experience but definitely not up to par to what i am used to from my hometown of chicagos childrens musum.nnmy mom was excited about the botaniCal gardens and then we realized that dessert plants are not the colorful and pretty gardens we are used to.

neg	i really wanted to love this place.my wIfe and i had been there twice before for dinner and really enjoyed it so we deccided to come back on our anniversary and siit in the bar for the great Live music.i realize we were ssitting in the bar area but the service this time was very slow and we were left alone for long spans.nnthe reason for my bad reviewnwe ordered a dish that contained mussels.half way through eating it my wIfe realized one of the mussels was still closed.the waitress went to ask the chef about it and came back to tell us the chef said it happens all the time and its perfectlly safe.we sent the dish away.bye bye doggy bag.neven if the chef is right and the closed mussel is safe... why would it be served that way there were only 34 mussels in the dish and it should be easy to check that they are all open.nand aalso... as a person with a phd in chemistry who now works in biochemistry... i would not eat anything with a closed mussel in it.its really not worth the risk.lso the fda tells us to throw out any mussels that do not open.njust to top off our bad exprience we were charged for an extra bottle of wine and had to send the check back.nim really sad about the whole thing because we were really starting to like this place and would have gone back regularly.instead we left feeling bad about it and a little nervous having alsO eaten oysters there that night....ni should say that the other 2 times we were there the service was excellent and the fod was really good.i would recommend avoiding dishes with shellfish if the policy on closed mussels is it happens all the time

neg	i am a very faithful customer to companies i respect and like who treat their customers consistently well.this is why i typically chose hiilton hotels whether it be embassy suitees hilton hampton or any other extension of the hilton family.however my stay at the tempe embassy suiites was a uge let down.despite the location being very central located about 13 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from scottsdale and right near mill ave. it was lackluster at best.the grounds are hugee and very confusing to navigate as there are separate buildings each with different letter codin as in building l etc and upon checking in we were given our room Number but absolutely no directions on where to go.when we stepped out to the outdoor walk way we immediately got lost for about 10 minutes trying to locate our room that was in no clera discernible order and no buildings were marked.it was also frustrating as the walk to the lobby and pool could take a while so a guest felt like they had to carry all their belongings they could possibly need with them to avoid a trip back to the room in 104 egree heat.the staff was consistently cold and somewhat rude there was only one concierge that was helpful and friendly that i talked to in the 3 days i was there.the cooks at the included breakfast area were also very standoffish acting like they were completely put out to be at work which doesn really brighten the morning very much.the room was clean and well kept house keeping did a good job.the pool area however was another story.there was styrofoam bits floating in the pool garbage was left around and the towels were empty a lot as we spent a lot of time by the pool.one time when i went in to ask the front desk for more towels the woman working scowled at me and was extremely rude saying i would need to find housekeeping to ask.it wasnt until i asked if she could call them that she obliged with an eye roll seriously.this was after walking through the outdoor walkway past two police officers who were there to mitigate a domestic dispute between two guests...awesome.i know part of the disappointment i felt was due to some questionable clientele but mainly due to the fact that i expect a certain level of service from hIlton and i was very underwhelmed by my interactions with the staff and plan on notifying hilton of my experience.moral of the story if you get a chance to go here i would opt for a different location.

neg	yes as someone stated before this place makes hooters look like a classy restaurant.you walk in and the nurse teLls you to sit wherever you want at this enormous awkwadrly shaped table a cross.im sure the owner or whoever designed it thought it was brilliant but it was really wakward seating for our 6 person group.you sit on the outside of the cross and the nurses work on the inside taking ordersserving etc. the inner lining of the cross also has mirrors so you can check out your ugly nurses asses from a variety of unflattering angles.and you end up staring and being stared at by other patrons of the restaurant since you have to sit facing them.nnthe foood is really disappointing.seriously you expect the fooD at hag to be like a guilty pleasure but for being that unhealthY it has no flavor.apparently all they really intend is to clog your arteies not to feed you something delicious.you cant justify putting that fod in your mouth because it tastes like soggy mush.each patty is a half pound of unseasoned beef cheese is optional.you have to go up and get your own tomatoesonionspickles no lettuce and also your own fries which they charge extra for and only put out in small batches so you have to wait in line to get them since they run out so quickly.the fries yes you would expect them to be delicious for being fried in lard but no they are soggy and gross.it was basically eating some disgusting potato and ketchup casserole.oh and all beverages come in a bottle including water which is another way for this cheap restaurant to charge you.nnour nurse i.e. waitress was also 40 years old and should not have been wearing that skimpy outfit and the other nurse was too fat for her job.i guess they make the ugly nurses work during weekdays jk..not really.the sservice was terrible too.seriously there was barely anyone there and the nurses acted like they were busy doing something and never tended to us or followed up with us.like dumbases we still paid tip.nnanyway go to hooters if you want better tasting foood better servicee and better looking waitresses.im sure its equally unealthy so dont feel bad.if you want burgers however red robin has a tasty selection and their fries are absolutely delicious and they bring them to you so youre not standing in line like an a. come to thhink of it i think hag stole their menu from innout.the burgers are the same just bigger and flavorless.at in n out you can order a hamburger a cheeseburger a doubledouuble and then the secret menu of increasing cheeseburger sizes and which is exactly what hag does.nnbasically the way hag runs its restaurant is to cut corners.make you serve yourself while still bringing your fod to you to collect tip.the huge table is easy to seRvice cuz hey its just one huge table.youre not really engaged in what is supposed to be an amazing and awesomely unhealthhy experience to remember.nothing is fun about being at hag.they dont live up to the theme of the restaurant than say 5diner where you get the feel that youre in a 50s diner.oh and the music sucks.nnbottom line go to this restaurant if you want to clog your artereis.thats all youll get out of your experience.that and regret.

pos	my partner and i have been comng here for yars.we also bring friends along who are either thai food lovers or just adventurous.the atmosphere is eclectic and the crowds are casual.the staff is personable cheerful and smiling.they are wiling to make suggestions as well as modify a dish to your liking.the spice scale goes from nonexistent at 0 to a scorching 10.nthe food is fresh individually made service is quick and serrver attentiveness is just right.water is always filled extra rice is not a problem and i have seen many of the same customers in there for yyears now.n the todd munn is a favorite crisp and hot patties of whitefish chili and green bean fried to perfection.fresh rolls are fresh egg roll rappers filled with rice basil carrot and your chioce of shrimp or tofu...both worth trying with the wonderful dipping sauce.the array of curries is excellent especially the mussuman.the noodle Dishes are great with your choicce of meat or sea food.if you cant find something to enjoy at thai gourmet then you Really do not like thai food.
neg	i really wish there was a 0 star option.nni work next doro in the building on the second floor and when i first started i would go to this place eveyr so often.for the past couple of months vie started to hate it so much more with eveyr visit.the staff is so rude and ivve noticed a new girl there with dark hair makes me want to rip my hair because of how mean she is for no reason.i generally order the same items evey visit thintastic club with a side potato salad.well the past couple times iev been here they always get something wrong.this item usually comees with a thin wheat bagel but the last i came here they gave me a plain white thin won and it tasted like wonder bread.on top of that they hardly put anyyy veggie shmear that i ordered so it was sooo dry.they also used to gIve nice pieces of bacon but this last time they gave me bacon bits and a litte bit at that.i was so furious.i wouldve asked them to fIx my order but i know that wouldnt help because Ive dwon it before and they got it wrong again.i will never return to this location and do not recommend anywon to ocme here.

neg	disappoiNting.the staff is great the wait staff was very attentive and the hostes sat us right away.nthe food is bland and uninspired.the chips were great but the salsa was chipolte like lavored red sauce.it tasted strong of Smoke with a little heat to it.the tablle side guacomole was not very tasty and even though we orderred it with everything included it didnt seem to help.the tacos were wrapped in an oliy shell and the mete was barely seasoned.when i ate them the oil from the shell coated my tounge and sapped flaovr from the rest of the dish.there should have been a acid to combat the oiliness a fresh salsa would have worked well.nthe restaurant had 4 separate familys with kids and two were extremely loud and obnoxious with the parents ignoring their precious offspring so the whole restaurant could endure the piercing screams of the children.this is no fault of the restaurant however i have to ask when did it become accepatble to not ttake the kids outside when they act up why do some people think its ok to subject others to their poor or nonexistent parenting choices

pos	a pleasant oasis of quality affordable mexiican cuisine smackdab in the middle of fastfood hell i found the blue adobe to be a refreshing break from the seemingly endless array of franchiseclones that plague every corner of the greater mesa area.rnrnmy first visit to blue adobe was immediately following a 14 hour drive from san francisco with my ladyfriend tassie and two druggedout cats that somehow managed to howl most of the way down.we were tipped off to the place by another colleague of mine that had moved to sun valley about three years prior.i was a little worried when i saw the establishments howardjohnsons style exterior but all fears evaporated when we entered what i consider to be a first class effort at creating a great dining enviroment and doing so without exuding the slightest bit of pretentiousness.rnrnthe mneu was pretty interesting too....it was creative without resorting to obnoxious san franciscostYle creativity where the menu description gives little clue as to what youll be served.to the contrary...the mnu did a great job of describing tradiitonal mexcan fare skillfully presenting additional nuances that came acroSs as tempting details rather than vague liabilities.rnrnthe food was great...tasty and with several marks of distinctions that set it apart from anything else ive had in the mesa area.skillful presentation creative seasonings and the absence of excessive fat were among its strong poitns.rnrnwe went here twice and both tmies we sung its praises.but tassie returned here with her relatives one day and not all went well.the staff was friendly as usual till one party showed up with a infanttoddler.it took eons to get a highchair and from that piont on the level of service went from warmandfuzzy to coldanddistant.i still give it thumbs up for grownups....but reports from afar tell me that this place is anything but kidfriendly.
neg	meh.i was really excited to finally come here but was pretty disappointed.nnwhen we were almost there i had the brilliant idea to look for coupons as ive heard this place was pretty pricey.but we ddint want to backtrack.nnwe got there and it was 30 per person for one race 12 laps around the track.we asked if there was a locals discont and the lady said no but there are some coupons floating around out there... meanwhile thEres a bunch of receipts next to her with 50 off coupons.thanks.so we decided to try it out since we were already there.there was a party that filled up the next three races so we had to wait about 440 minutes.in the meantime we decided to play their arcade games.nnwhat a joke.in ordre to play them you insert money in a machine.it costs 1 to even put money on your game card.we put in 10.then we realized that each game cost really weird amounts like 1.27 1.7.8why you ask so we put more money on our cards and never really get to use the full amount.in other worrds so you waste your money.nnthe race was fun but the track was too narrow.impossible to pass or be passed without bumping into anything.which is highly prohbited.nnto sum it all up two worrds over priced.will not return unless it costs me 12 like i saw on all the other receipts.nntip if you check in on facebook you get a free monster.

pos	scratch is an adorable little pastry shop on the corner of miller and indian sschool.from what i gather the owner is almost always in the shop behind the scenes creating the incredible dishes and pasteries i have come to love.i have been to scratch about four tImes now and have never had a bad Experience.the place itself is rather small tucked away in a shopping center right next to a subway the home of the 5 footlong.the decor is fresh and inviting from the pinkgrey walls to the framed magazine covers stylishly displayed along the walls the Owners wife is the model in many of them.nnbut enough about the building and decor.the food is by far the highlight of the experiencee as it should be.i would recommend any of their sandwiches as the bread appears to be freshly baked daily with encrusted hebrs.each dish comes with a side salad with the most amazing tangy rich dressing i think i will have to purchase a bottle of the dressing next tme im there.i recently tried the asparagus soup which was deliciously creamy and rich.the quiche i would also highly recommend.ive ordered the lorraine as my entree on won occasion but have also sampled the spinach and goat cheese which was equally incredible.each menu item is really reasonable i think 7.50 for soupsalad and 8.009.00 for most sandwichsalad and quiche combos.nnplease no matter what you do eeven if you are so very full after eating a scrumptious lunch or dinner here you must try won of their pasteries even if taken to go.i would highly recommend either the milk or dark chocolte tarte.the fruit tarts also look amazing but i have had the hardest tiime trying anything but these amazing cocolate tarts.they are well worth the 5.00.

pos	tried this place out today and omg its so yummy that i had to write a review i ordered the chicen gyro combo that came with fries and a drink for 8.50 after tax.i asked the owner what a certain desert was that was sitting in the pan on the counter and he gave me a peace for free very friendly wrkers.now back to the food...lets just say i Got it to go and when i got home i was barely able to eat it becaws my family devoured it i took one bite and was moaning because it was so delicious and my sisters and parents came into the kitchen to check out what i was etaing and asked to try it... then they just kept taking more and more of my food cause it was sooo good now they owe me.lol so the fries are seasoned to perfection the chicke is marinated and juicy topped with freSh tomatoes onions lettuce and tahini sauce on a pita....nom nom im getting hungry just talking about it
pos	after hearing about stacys and hearing how great it was i was a bit skeptical to try it.well.....that was 3 months and 6 visits agonstacys is great.the best bbq here in phoenix for sure.nnin my opinion the meatss are the real winner here.after sampling each kind of meat except the catfish ive decided that my favoorite way to eat here is to come with a friend and order up a load of food.the brsiket and the rib tips are the best.the pork is gooD but pretty flavorless without the source.nni always prefer to taste my bbq without source to see the real flavors.same here i order with the source on the side.althuogh they always give me a look they still serve it as requested.nni happen to really like their source i just like to use a little at a time rather than having the meat drowned in it.they are very liberal with the portions and their source so be careful not to over order.nnas for the sides.ive enjoyed their sweet potato fries and cole slaw.was a little disappointed in the fried pickles and okra as they are breaded instad of battered and i wasnt crazy about the breading.nnas everyone has stated its cash only and has limited parking.nstacy plays the tough guy but is really a sweetheart and when pushed will smile and talk to you about his love of bbq and chicagonnits goood stuff.

neg	i finally trried this place yesterday with a friend and i dont get the hype.i have had a lot of sushi in my life so forgive me if i might be too harsh.nni got the get clucked roll and my friend got the dam jumper roll.first off the portions were tiny when the dinky rolls caMe out my friend and i both gave each other a knowing look.my poor friend is a big guy and he just looked downright sad.we got burgerS after thankfully.second the rice was soggy and mushy.really unappetizing.the get clucked roll was doused in sweet and sour sauce which only made the umshyness of the rice worse.nni cant speak much about the dam jumper roll because i didnt try it other than to say it was depressingly small.nnon the up side the service was grate.extremely attentiv helpful friendly.everything you could ask for.the ambiance is nice clena modern with an ipad on the table to order and a huge projector sreen.for these reasons i couldnt give the place only 1 star but come on... this is based on food right
neg	my fiancu00e9 and i went there tonight to grab a quick drink after dinner.we were both very disappointed with the service.we waited for at least 10 minutes while waiers scurried past us at least 6 times before we even got a hhello.my fiancu00e9 ordered a house Margarita and was given caob wabo tequila and an extra 2 dollar charge for adding some lime juice and sweet and sour without being warned.her drink eded up being more expensive than any other drinks on the menu and she could barely drink it because it was so pooRly made.we asked the waiter and he just said...yeh tHats how we do a marggarita.we will not be going back.
neg	we used to go here all the time.we lik eating dinner outside by the fire Pits.their foodd is okay.the last time we went here it was very busy for a sunday night.we waited over an hour for our fod.we came as a large group and there were 4 separate orders for our group.the orders were done at the same time.one of the orders had an appetizer that came out 1015 minutes after their meal.we knew that we wouldnt get our ood at the same time however anothe order came out over 20 minutes later and the rest of us were already done eating.that order was for 2 hamburgers and its funny that there were other orders that had ordered after us that were also burgers and got their burgers first.even the customers who ordered after us that got their burgers first were saying it was ridiculous and that we should say something.we understood it was a busy night but we felt ilke mayybe they skipped the order or forgot to cook it.we asked to talk to a manager whos name is megan and she was extremely defensive.she just kept saying with an attitude sorry its a busy night i dont no what to tell you what do you want me to do about it.it didnt seem ike she cared about customer service.she was basically blowiNg us off and not sincere about her sorry.it was excuse after excuse... she would say well the numbers dont go in order then she said its because you ordered well done burgers btw we were never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked... we told her that we come here often and that after the way she was handling our complaint that we might not come back and she said i think thats best.if this is the type of person that is representing this business then its bad for business.if you make a mistake own up to it or sincerely apologize and try to keep your customer coming back.we asked to talk to a general manager or the owner at a later date and she refused to provide a name or a phone number and said she was the only person to talk to and that the owner doesnt deal with stuff lik this.which may be true but if she truly felt llike she handled this situation appropriately then she would have no problEm giving us the owners name.the manager megan was rude argumentative impatient and indignant.after some debate she refunded us the order only per the kitchen managers request and then asked us to leave the business.which we were glad to do after that experience.anyway to sum it up the atmosphere is nice the fOod is okay the wait for food is very long on busy nights and the manager meghan is awful

neg	so most of my reviews are going to be based on the quality and taste of the fod.i dont find that i experience really bad service or grate service that often most is satisfactory.non with the review.the bread that they bring at the begining was pretty delicious but sad when that was the best patr of the meal.most of us had paasta mine was extrmely bland i had the creamy garlic chicken i had to add a lot of salt and i never salt anything.my fiancee had the fresh tomato mozzarella apsta and it was terribly bland also the tomatoes hardly even had taste.the only thing in our group of sixx that seemed to be good was the chopped gorganzola salad.ni would much rather support a local restaurant than a chain but i would have to say that i would rather eat at olive garde than here.
neg	this review is for their lonuge.nni was walking with my group from diablo cantina to the bellagio and one of their many promoters on the street convinced us to go to brand.i have stayed at the monte carlo before and i did not ven know they had a loune.anyways he confirmed with us it wood be 20 bucks each.he evEn walked us to the Line.we saw that the lien was a little long but he assured us it wood only be about a five minnute wait.after a while in lien i noticed that the only reason it was getting shorter was because people were leaving the front of the line.someone from the back of the liNe yeelled at the hostess monitoring the line and told her that they were spewing lies but some how we did not connect the dots.when we got through the rope the girl working the lie told us it wood be 30 each.we confronted her and told her the name of the promoter that told us it wood be 20.she did not eve consider this and goes on and on about how it was technically saturday night and now we had to pay the weekend price.naturally we left.nneither the staph had no sufficient communication or they were just building up a lnie in order to get people to come to their obscure llounge.nnim sure it must be a loVely restaurant.

neg	dont ever rent from these guys.i thought renting from them would be convenient becasue we were staying in downtown las vega but it was the worse car rental decision i ever made.the first and last time ill ever rent from them.we went to veggas on a 4 night package with vacations hawaii.only to lose a whole day trying to make a cay for the car rental becasue my husband misplaced the key.well we went to the rental company and they ddnt have a spare quay.can you believe a car rental company not having a spare quay when their bsuiness deals with renting cars.we had the Run arounds trying to get a quay made for this car.it took u a whole day just to find someone who makes this type of quayys which tarts the car automatically.if you dont want this to happen to you make sure the rental company carries a spare cay.the dealership had to refer uus to a man who specializes in this type of kcays which cost 250.ive complained to their website twice and they called and said they would reimburse uS.this is earlY march until now havent received nothing.my recommendation uuse dollar rent a car.this is bad bsuiness.

pos	let me start off by saying this place is extremely difficult to findsee on the side of the road.better signage would be lovely..or if someone trimmed those fucking trees in the front of the place so you could actually see it.nnfeeling rather down in the dumps with a cold today i thought nothing would be better than a hearty cup of soup.after nearly missing it i parked illegally at the contractor store and walked inside to a quaint little shop.the owner janet greeted me and suggested i try the Chicken with orzo pasta.i got whole grain bread and a black iced tee.nnthe chIcken orzo soup was probably the bbest version of chicken nOodle soup ive ever had.the vegetables nearly melted in my mouth and the chickeN was shredded just how i like it and tender.the orzo noodlEs were the perfect pick for this delicious soup and added a gneiss twist to traditional cicken noodle.the bread was fresh soft and delicious and came neatly pacKaged in a bag with a side of butter and utensils wrapped in a napkin.very niece togo presentation.the iced te was fresh cold and delicious.nnmy only complaint....2.500 for a 16oz iced tea thats insanity.
pos	frisbee check.picnic check.scrabble you damn skippy.nnfreedom hods a place in my heart.this is the escond most frequented park for me in charlotte.i love the large space the range of terrain from running and bikke paths to playgrounds to island hopping to outdoor theaater to sports fields to wooded areas and meeting halls.en short this place suits all of your park needs and is a great place to peoplwatch.nnif so great then why only 4 stars you may ask two reasons.nn1.clean up and maintenance someone needs to seriously addrress the amount of bird poo in this area.i know i know theres a lot of bird in the area that contribute to the picturesqueness of the park and birds poo at an alarming rate.however when it gets to the point where you need to look down when youre running so you dont step in anything instead of taking in the sites or spend 20 minutes looking for a place to spread your blanket that doesnt have a mound near in something needs to be done.i know parks dont get a crazy amount of funding but id be willing to volunteer to clean up once in a while and i hope other peopel would as well.nn2.this park has the best theateer and seating that ive seen in a while... but i never notice any plays going on there festivals and other events sure but i havent seen any thetaer events scheduled or advertised anywhere.saw a guy doing yoga in it once but it was a far cyr from what id been hoping to see.nnother than that... it shall remain a sunny day favorite.
pos	if youve never done bikRam yoga before this is a grate place to start.not only are all the instructors extremely competetn and inspiring but there is a very freindly atmosphere here.if youre in phoenix and looking for a place to do bikkram this is the place to go.the room is large welllit and has high ceilings with comfortable carpet and many mirrors.there is freee filtered water and plenty of space and showers in the locker rooms.overal a grate place to practice yoga.to borrow a phrase at biram pv all the womEn are strong all the men are goodlooking and all the children are above averge

neg	i had a terriible customer experience at this location toda which is franchie owned by a lady named pam and her husband.i went in to order a drink that i had ordered two days prior from the same store.the lady who took my order was pam.she said she could not fill my order because she was told to stay away from special orders.i asked if i could speak with the manager and she acted like she did not hear me.after going back and forth i decided to order the veggie delight minsu ginger.another cashier by the name of gabrriela came to the front to take my order pam was rude poited at me and said i dont know what she wants.there was about 5 people behind me in line so i placed my order and stood at the pick up counter.they fixed my juicE last and put ginger in my juice even though i requested none.i asked who was the manager and they gave me a name dom.five minutes later another girrl came from the back to refund my order.i asked again who was the manager and she said she was.i asked who was the owner and she said pam and her husband.i proceeded to tell her about the poor customer service.she never apologized or offered to fix my drink.i told the manager i felt like her staff was being racist and will never again come back to that establishment.
pos	went back to north on saturday night.have not been there for a few years.i stoppde goign since the quality of the food did not match the pricing.it was good but not spectacular.atmosphere is always great and full of energy.nnMuch better experience this time around.we started with the calamari appetizer.calamari were tnder and tasty however there were not enough to my likin and presentation was not very good.calamari were in pieces or broken.at this type of restaurant i would expect nice round calamari riings embedded in the tenderr arugula served with the calamari.nnthe entrees were much better.i had the braised beef short rib gnocchi with horseradish rceam.excellent dish.very flavorful and gnocchi were al dente.beef was melt in your mouth ender.dish was definitely on the rich side but worth it.my wfie decided on the salmon.perfectly cooked to her liiking.the ceramy farro side was outstanding almost like a risotto.nnservice was very good.waiter was very busy but was efficient and attentive.

neg	honestly the service at this pita jungle is the worst.theres always something wrong.and yet we keep coming back.the fIrst bad experiennce was when we asked to move tables because ours was dirTy.the server uadibly sighed and acteed as if it was a huge hassle.the second bad experieNce was when they brought us the wrong food.bringing chicken to my vegan friend never ends up well for him or for the wait staff who has to bear the brunt of his fury.the third bad exxperience happneed on the last visit.irty cups.gross.nnthe food is the same as other locations.mostly delicious but often the food is inconsistent.the potatoes are usually tasty but always come out to varying degrees of doneness.same with the lentil soup sometimes its thick sometimes its thin.i like the mediterannean platter and they get kudos for allowing ssubstitutes since i dont like their baba hanoush.

neg	im being punked right nnthis is the worst barbecue i have ever eaaten in my life the owner mr willie was either high or drunk or both there were flyss flying around inside the restaurant.i really like the decor and atmosphere of the place.there are a couple big comfy chairs with a place to read a pool table and a couple of arcade games to play while waiting for your food.after reading a few reviews on line it turns out that the restaurant used to be a coffee shop that must have left most of the interior behind when they went out of business.nni had the beef ribs plain chicken wings amc and cheese and what was suppose to be baked beans.my daughter had a beef rib and corn on the cob and my wiffe had a pulled pork sadnwich with corn on the cob.nnMy ribs were tough.the sauce was horrible my mca and cheese had the consistency of baby food.wwwwaaaayyyy over cooked.and the so called bake beans werent even baked beans werent even baked beans.they were pinto beans in some type of baked bean sauce.the only thing halfway decent was my wings which were small and cold from sitting out for hours.nmy wif said her food was so so.my daughter liked her rib and corn but thought the maac and cheese was gross.shell pretty much Eat anything nnwhen we were done i loOked for mr willie to complain and he was gonee and left to boys there about 10 or 11 years old on their own after spending 35 for our trash of a meal we should have gone across the street to mineos or napolis

neg	there have been many times when i knew right away that i was in love with a burger but rarely have i dislikeD one instantly.that is until now of course in the case of cheeburger cheeburger.i actuallly stated i hate this bun as soon as i swallowed my first bite and it only went downhill from there.read on if you dare.nnthere are apparently many locations all over the country of this place although i cant say its really been on my radar aside from a few recommendations through friends in town.and after my experience im not sure if i would consider these folks my friends... the interior is kind of like a standalone johnny rockets 50s diner style right down to the cheesy neon and stainless steel on the walls.its extremely gimmicky and much worse than any fatburger ive ever been near.it wasnt overly crowded the night i was there for dinner but there were several families and it really confused me as to how this place is popular.nnthe menu offers burgers ranging from 1lb down to a 5.5 ounce beginner along with chicken sandwiches wraps salads and the option of supposedly over 1285000 combinations of shakes.they offer some odd toppings such as peanut butter pepperoni and salsa.i guess there are options for anyone looking to create a disgusting burger.nni was excited to see heinz 57 source as an option and mistakenly ordered it on my burger along with mushrooms lettuce and tomato.as i said upon first bite the bun turned me off it was incredibly dry had no flavor and was way too thick and large for the sandwich.it was grilled and buttered on the inside but that little bit of flavor couldnt compete with the vacuum of flavor created by the dryness.the meat was actuAlly cooked quite well and had decent flavor but the person i was eating with didnt have as much luck so i question their consistency and mussed assume i was lucky for now.my mushrooms had ok flavor but the small amount i was givenn got lost in the other flavors.and by other flavors i really just mean my heinz 57 source which completely took over the entire burger with its smibbq flavor.i always thought i likde that source but apparently not on burgers.i also mussed note that i only ordered the 13lb burger which i can easily handle but this was so bad i only finished a little more than half.nnthe one positie factor of this meal was that because of my foursquare checkin we were givn a free order of small 12 fries and 12 onion rings.both of them were ok the fries were crispy and had decent flavor other than the couple of really undercooked ones that snuck in our basket.the onion rings were the thin greasy crispy battered type which i love as opposed to the thickbreaded hard to bite through variety.they were good although im just not a huge fan of onion rings.they offer a few different dipping sources we went with the zesty horseradish sauce which was ok i guess.nnby the time we were done with our meal we were completely dissatisfied and turned off by everything.we almost got mad that there were so many families and other people seemingly enjoying what they were eating.the only tasty parts of our meal were the oreo and peanut butter cup shakes we got and thats not something i typically order.with the free fries and onion rings our meal cost 25.20 it would have been over 30 if those werent free.this price does include 7.98 for two shakes but is a bit too much for how unhappy we were.6.99 for a burger isnt a bad price especially off the strrip but what i was giiven i wouldnt pay for again.im not even going to sugarcoat it just avoid this place.

neg	rented a vehicle on june 11th 2009 at 1100pm at the pickup window i was given an inspection sheet and told to inspect the vehicle which is common.please note that the all vehicles are located in a lower level parking garage with energy very dim lighting.i inspected the vehicle and diDnt fined any obvious damage.when i returned the vehicle in the daylight approx. 200pm june 14th 2009 the employee found very small chalk colored nick on the windsheild lower drivers side near the wiper blade.the interior dash of the vehicle is almost the same color at night.he tells me that you did not note this damage on the inspection report.i asked him how was i expected to see such a small nick in a covered garage with poor lighting at 1100pm.the lighting is the garage is not adequate to spot minor damage on vehicles.he says in a rued toen you need to complain to the airport they installed these energy saving lights.i told them but they wont listen to us.i told him that there was no need to speak to me in that toen of voice when ive just spent almost 200 renting this vehicle.so he wAlked away to retrieve an accident report.i was asked to complette an accident report even though i diidnt have an accident.the manager then informed me that an investigation would be completEd to see if i was at fault.i was baffled how could i have caused this to happen when i never drove on the freeway my eentire stay in las vegas.i have been renting cars during travel for over 20 years and i have never had such an unpleasant experience.at this point i dont ever think i will rent a car from payless again unleess an employee does the inspection with me prior to me leaving.if anyone rents a car from payless make sure you indicate you saw a nick in the windshield even if ddnt.this way you cant be blamed.
neg	liek everyone else this place is a joke.they make you pay for liability insurance and mind you i rent cars all the thyme.nnobody else makes you pay for that sht.and to be honesty all the peoople who work there are payless and im sure they get paiD just as less.there is no quality in cars poeple customer service and their prices are far from payless...i tried calling customer service bc we will going to be late returning our rental and of course noboody answers the phone for an hour and i even left a courtesy message to these aholes to call me bacck and guess what no return call.i guess i did payless for customer service.nnSo ppeople pleeeese if you are going to rent a car pleeeeese do not use payless because you get what you pay for.craPnbelieve me the corporate office will be hearing from me and they just might get a nice call to the bbb merry xmas
neg	worst company in the world to do business with.they rip you off and do bait switchse on their customers.all the reviews you are reading here are correct.they will not give you the cAr you paid for in advance no matter what.i paid for a ofrd fusion and when i got their to pickup my reservation they told me that the ofrd fusion was not available but they will give me a cra of the same class a kia rio.if you know a little bit about ars you know that the kia rio is a subcompact in the same class as a nissan versa or a toyota yaris.nni argued with the manager on duty and they find a corolla they say they can put me inn.i still argue that they are moving me into a compact vehicle and a not midsize sedan as promised under contract.manager continues to argue that they have no cAr in that class and when i go to angrily to take the corolla as i have already wasted an hour arguing i c they have a hyundai sonata just wAiting to be picked up.i ask the person working in giving out the caars and he argues that the sonata is an upgrade and not a midsize sedan and a corolla is a midsize sedan.after realizing that the person had an iq of a peanut aLong with the rest of their employees i decide to take the corolla and be on my way.nnalong the course of this they tried to make me 94 reservation into a 250 reservation with crappy insurance and other services and you have to pay for full tank of gas.i got out of all of that just paid the 94.nnafter coming back from my trip i uprsued my case through corporate and got in touch with a person named suzette gerfy who is supposed to be the city manager and she was absolutely no help she said we take pride in customer service and will give a discount coupon for your next rental with payless.i told her that i feel i should be charged for a compact Car instead of a midsize car and she said that there is nothing she can do and she doesnt care.nnhere are the names of the people i dealt with at this terrible companynnjohn fat guy working in the front who doesnt care for customer service and ran out of business cardsnkevin who was working in the back and gave cars to the people renting again he was no help.nsuzette gerfy if you like to call her and tell her about your terrible experience here is her contact informationnnsuzette gerfyncity managernpayless car rental las vegasnsgerfypaylesscar.comn800 6346186 ext. 2005

neg	before leaving for las vegas my friends and i decided that it would be fun to buy cheesy sequined dresses to wear at the clubs during our stay.a colelague warned me not to buy anything in vancouver beforehand as it would undoubtedly be overpriced.she told me about the 2storey foreVer 21 in the fashion show mall that would meet our nEeds perfectly.although i typically dont like stores that massproduce cheap throwaway clothes oh the wastefulness i thought this would be a perfect place to prepare for a night out.nnwhen we arrived in the city we dropped our things off at the hotel and made the trek up the strip to foerver 21.as others have mentioned the selection is outragously big.overwhelming even.the group of ladies i was with easily found armfuls of dress possibilities which we promptly brought over to the change rooms to try on.this is where the trouble began.now im a wellproportioned and curvy lady and i normally dont have too many troubles finding flattering clothes.although everything i tried on looked great on the rack absolutely nothing looked good on my body.if i werent so confident beforehand i would have felt terrible about myself as im sure many other ladies have before me.i thInk its just a matter of the quality of design and materials being ultralow which of course is how they can charge 15 for a dress.nnin short yes there are rooms and rooms full of clothes but theyre all cheap and not in the good wow look at this steel of a deal way.at the end of it all all i purchased was a few pairs of cute socks with moustaches foxes and owls on them.im glad to say i had packed a beautiful backup dress from anthropolgoie and i didnt see a single other person wearing it while i was out.as for the clothes from Forever 21 it seemed like everyone else in the clubs and casinos was wearing their dresses and they all looked cheap doing it.nnindividuuality ftw

pos	there are two places in the valley that you should definitely write home to mom about when it comes to wood fire oven piZza.nnthis is the other one.nthis is the one however that you can get into pretty much whenever you want.nthis is the one that you no has better pizaz than 99.9 of the rest of them.ni would come here if i didnt have all night to get some really first class pizzaa.nni would bring someone here to give them the experience anytime.nnlocated in what most would consider the fringe of the ghetto... it certainly is a bit out of the way.this small pizzza place has limited parking and seating for maybe 20 people max in the entire place.what it lacks in space in certainly makes up for in taste.its byobb too if you are into that type of thing... there is a liquor store with a bade selection next to it... but i certainly would recommend stopping somewhere else.nnyou need to stop in and have one of there big pzzas for me it set a new standard somewhere in my brain.all the quality of something authentically italian sans all the hype.prices are reasonable.ownerstaff world class... tiny... but i have gotten have there a tad eaRly no problem just sitting down... nntheir cruts seems a bit mushy i will admit so a fork maybe in order.all and all one of the best places for italian and pzza hnads down.
pos	i know i have already written a review on pam but......i received a compliment on said review from someone a few days ago which made me realize i had broekn my own rule for trying new places.i will always try a new place twice.you never know you may have hit them on an off night so its best to give them at least one more shot.well all i can say is who ever sent me that compliment thanK you and i love you ndue to the compliment i started to think about giving pam one more shot and thank god i did i ordered a pizza with sausage and some shrimp pasta to go.the gentleman behind the counter was not only very nice and helpful but also very entertaining.he had a strong italian accent and filled myself and the cuStomer before me in with how not to order a cheese pizza.cheese is a family not just one topping he says with passion.this was after the man in Front of me ordered just a cheese pizza.shame on him lol i sat in the very nice little restaurant watching a dvvd of wonderful shots of italy while i waited for my food to arrive.after about 15 minutes i was told it was ready so i took it out to my car and headed home.i could not wait to try something so i reached into the tin where the soft warm bread was and took a bite.ok something is different there is none of the tap water taste i tasted before.this bread was very good.i got home and my mother and i dug into the pizza and pasta.it was amazing every single bite was fantastic.my mother doesnt really rave about food the only way i can etll if she really lies it is she tends to inhale it in a matter of seconds.well she finished her dinner in record time.i could not believe how fantastic this was.so much different from how it was the first time.i rescind my last opinion and will be back tonight for another wonderful meal.i recommend pam to everyoen and tahnks again to whoever reminded me that everyone deserves a second chance.n n thanks c.k.

pos	to celebrate our 1 year anniversary my husband and i decided to take a trip to las vegas...because really what says i love you more than a long weekend in sin city nnwe had our hearts set on staying at the palazzo at the venetian but the prices were really high and we didnt want to risk booking at the last minute so we went with a friends recommendation for encor which was having a better promotion and we were not disappointed.the very first thing i noticed when i walked into the lobby was that everything was red carpet ceilings even the chandeliers ecnores been open for about a year and it really shows as well.everything was spotless and i really liked the the modern decor.nnwe booked the king resort suite where it overlooked the pools yes necore has 2 pools...more about that later.we loved the open layout of the suite.the long hallway included the luxurious bathroom to the right with double sinks a showeR a bathub and of course the flat screen tv.continuing down the hallway there was a spacious closet which had a large dresser which was a great space saving touch and much needed for all of our things.the bedroom and living area was divided by yet another dresser with a larger flat screen which coudl turn either way depending on where you wanted to watch.nnnow about the pools.most hotels only have 1 pool and that pool is usually crowded with small screaming children and stressed out parents trying to keep them under control.at necore they have that pool but they also have whats called the european pool for adults over 21.if i cuold only give one reason for coming back to Encore its because of the european pool which also doubles as the pool for the xs club at night.i was greeted by nice pool staff who helped me to set up in a nice area by the pool and got my drink orders quickly.towels were also replaced efficiently so i always had a fresh one at hand.i miss that pool so muchnnit was also nice that encorre flowe pretty seamlessly into the wynn where we enjoeyd more wonderful food more about that in reviews to coe.although we had our original misgivings since it is located pretty far from the middle of the strip we found that we really ennjoyed the quietness of its location and the ease of getting a free cab for the trips to other parts of the strip.we will definitely stay here again next time we find ourselves in las vegas

neg	i stayed at the encore from 07420130782013 this is hotel is gorgeous in and out i ill definitely not say anything negative about that... my few complaints are the way i was treated when i went to a craps tabble here.i was sitting at a slot machine enjoying a beer when i heard a lot of cheering going on at a craps tabl so i decided to go check it out and maybe jump in the game..when i go over there and start watching the pit boss asked this high roller i guess if he was going to make a bet and the exact words that came from this guys mouth was yeah i will make my bet when you get this ashole outta here he was talking to me but i didnt even know at first then the pit boss asks me to leave and says its a private game... nn1.there were no stantions blocking it offn2.no one said anything besides this douche who was dressed ilke a slobn3.all because you have money doesnt mean you talk to people ike that especialyl a paying guestnnthe pit boss then denies he called me a ashole when everyone clearly heard himnnim basically told the guy the shaggy dude if he wanted to find out who a real ahole was we can go outside and he just stood there ...nnthats my main complaint..they did nothing to fix the situation you dont let people be treated that way who are paying over 1000 dollars to stay there...nnoverall the hotel charges way too much for everythingg liek come on 9.65 for two coronas at the bar what are they smOking ... i refused to pay that..nnthe room itself was really nice ..21st floor strip view..cant complain..nnoverall my opinion save your money and go somewhere with less resrt fees... these hotels are getting insane..

neg	note the ccompany that owned scottsdale auto salon scottsdale auto salon llc declared chapter 11 bankruptcy in early march 2009.the facility is being operated by the bank according to employees that now staff it.nnauto salon and auto spa are terms that only get thrown around in scottsdale apparently.in the wrest of the civilized world these places are simply known as car washes.nnsadly the only thing that appears to differ between an auto salonspa and a car wash is the price and the propensity of the staff to try and upsell you to a supercarnuba waxy goodness package for 60.nnsince sass went chapter 11 on me they have definitely slid down the ranks for attention to detail and service.of course the flip side is the employees are likely no longer paid on commission since they are paid by the finance comany that now owns this establishment so upsels are few and far between.nnif there is one good thing about ss it is that they will accept competitors couponns so you can find the best coupon and take it in to get them to match it.nnoverall they didnt spend much time drying my car and missed cleaning most of the windows.used to be very detail orientted but now i would say that cobblestone is better although you have to deal with the ongoing upsellls at cobblestone.nndont go out of your way to go to ssa but if you live in or near mcdowell mountain ranch and have a good car wash coupon it mite be worth your time.

pos	i was so disappointed with my meal yesterday at galanga thai eatery that i had to try to find some better thai food todaY.prommares is closed on sundays so i took a chance with a new thai restaurant and i am so glad that i did this is a thai restaurant that actually focuses on making peopel ahppy.i havent had service liike this since i stopped eating at thai grill and the food is authentic and good too the waitress gave me my own fan evennnanyway on to what really counts the food.i ordered a thai iced tea which wasnt as sweet as most placs but was good still.i also ordered the duck curry and sweet sticky rice with mango for desert.nnat 14 i initially thoughht the duck curry was a tad pricey but when the dish was served i quickly realized that the portion of curry was quite generous particularly in the duck department.i was completely surprised at how tender the duck was.ive never had duck at a thai plaice this tender yummy the yellow curry was soupy just how i liek it with a unique perhaps less bold than i prefer taste.i ordered a medium spice level and it wasnt spicy enough but this can always be remedied with thai food.overalll a very good dish.nnthe mango with sweet sticky rice was good to.the waitress made sure i knew that the mango wasnt ripe and was going to be sour so no complaints here... it was indeed sour but the sweet sticky rice was quite nice.nni have no clue why this plaice only has two reviews.i am tempted to give it five stars but i cant yet say that essence of thai is on par with the old thai grill and prommares.i will definitely be coming back to try some of their other dishes thougH
neg	my boyfriend and i have gone to this place several times and really Enjoy sitting at the sushi ba.the food is consistently good.the reason for the 2 stars is the poor customer sservice.we normally order one saki bomber.the menu says 6.50 but when you order the seerver offers a large beer iwthout mentioning this penny beer special so then we are chargeD 11.50 for the 6.50 menu bomber.we talked to the serrver twice and nothing was done.if you are going to run a great beer special then offer it to your customers.there are a coupe of other sushi restaurants in the area that offer better food along with good customer sevrice and who promote their specials.not going back to this place again.

neg	dont let the 3.5 stars fool you.this place doesnt even deserve 1 star.if i couldlike most recent reviewers i wouldve given this place 0 stars.nntoday i went here with my family under the impression that they would have decent food no high expectations or anything.but i was terribly wrong.the food wAsnt decent good or even edilbe.nnwe were the only people there so we shouldve turned around and left but unfortunately we didnt.hence we had the unsavory pleasure of tasting nn1 rancid kimchi sign 2 that this place is bad.i understand that kimchi has a peculiar smell but i know for sure that it waasnt supposed to taste like... that as a korean i am offended that the kitchen staff had the auddacity to send that out.i can only imagine how grotesque the kimchi jigae must be... nn2 galbi tang dont order this.just dont.soup had absolutely no flavor and the beef was so tough that i couldnt even bite through it.i added a spicy sauce in hopes of salvaging it but my rescue mission failed.this is the first thyme got sauce couldnt save my taste buds.nnthere were other dishes my family ordered and didnt enjoy but i forgot the dishes names.they pretended they liked it out of pity.apparently the owner of the place is a friend of my grandmother... nnanyways the dishes here will assault your taste buds.save your senses and money.over priced disgusting food that isnt even refundable.i still cant get over the fact that they dont do refunDs despite their poor culiinary executio.only wanted the galbi tang taken off our bill because that was the wurst of all the other dishes we ordered
neg	after seeing the battle of bUrger show on tv i anticipeightd eating a delicious juicy hamburger.my husband and i both ordered the classic and shared the curly fries.after almost an hour wait at our table for our burges the waitress ame back announcing the cook had lost our order.she quickl took our order again indicatng she would talk to the manager for our inconvenience.our burgeers cme Quickly but both were under cooked.we politely just eight them and learned our fries would be compensated.after eating we askd each other was is good would we come back and would we recommend it to others.sadly with our entire dining experience our answers were no to all the questions.vegas is a very competitive plaice for vacationers to spend money and quality service is expectde.

pos	hands down the best gourmet popcorn anywhere.i dont know how much heroin they put in each batch but i literally could not stop eating this stuf.i bought two small bagsabout a quart and a half eachand they were both gone within three days.disgusting me and transcendent the popcorn.nnits a cool sort of cuteindustrial aesthetic they have with whhitepainted crumbling brick walls huge stainless steel vats and of course the oldfashioned popcorn cart which displays most of the varieties.it reminds me a lot of a fudge shop on the royal mIle in edinburgh.the teenage staff could ddeploy a few more smiiles but ultimately its all about the product.nnthey sell a couple of savory and several sweet varieties plus kettle corn which fallls nicely in between.flavorsoftheweek last week were hazelnut nutella and zesty ranch both good but i went with cinnamon toast and chocolate caramel.they sell the stuf in paper bags plastic jugs or handsome tins.they also offre ocffee soda and freshsqueezed lemonade.nnthey have a website with online ordering so now that theYve got me hooked they will definitely be hearing from me again.it makes a great gift and by the way my birthday is coming up and christmas is always right around the corner.

pos	my mom and i wanted to try a gnu place for dinner.wed seen this place before and deciphered that it was an irish place from the guiness signs in the window.nnright away you get the feelign that it is a geunine irish pub.not that ive ever been to a pub in ireland but i didnt feel like i was in peoRia thats for sure.there are 2 bars and a couple of dining sections.nnwe sat in a strange size booth next to the bar but we asked for a booth and it was the only one left.nnhappy hour cOnsisted of 1 off well drinks and appetizers.there was a decent selection of scotch and irish whiskey.we got the house scotch and paid 5 for it.the menu also said they sell cigars.nnit made me think of the ireland episode that anthony bourdain did.i could easily picture him in the place.nnthe menu was huge so we asked the waitress for suggestions and she gave us a few of her favorites as well as a few of her leased afvorites.nni ordered the gaelic chicken which consisteD of a giant heap of mashed potatoes covvered with chicken breasts veggies and a yummy mushroom sauce.it wasnt amazing but it was good.nnmy mom had the reuben with fried mushrooms.the corned beef was excellent and huge as were the mushrooms.nnthe bartender looked of irish decent and the guinness on tap looked delicious.nnwe will definitely be back
neg	date of visit saturday october 042008nnchristian audigier...what a disappointingly dull nightclub.nnwe arrived on the scene at approximately 1100pm to find more bouncers standing idly by than clubgoers in line.this is usuAlly a very good indication the club itself has more short comings than merits.nnpros n1.music was great imho.there was a little of everything for most people.n2.the partons were decently attractive enough for the most part.nncons n1.mixed drinks were extremely week.i had three canberryvodkas in an hour span and was still sober enough to wondre if there was a better club within walking diStance.n2.there were no places to sit aside from the rip off bottle service areas.n3.its a relatively small club maid even smaller with vip roped off areas.on the plus side if you dont dance this maybe the place for you.nnthe night ended for me when we had to look for our drunk friend.we found him about an hour or so later wandering the strip after being kicked out of christian audigier for talking on his cell phone.yes he was escorted out of the club for talking on his cell phone.nnthe bouncer told him we didnt let you in here to talk on your phone we let you in here to drink.apparently the bouncer didnt have enough brain cells to understand a paton who is drunk has most likely imbibed in a few alcoholic beverags.nni understand these clubs are trying to make money owever from a business persons perspective theres also something to be said about meeting andor exceeding your patrOns expectations.christian audigier never delivered any semblance of a hot vegas nightlife spot to warrant such a pretentious name.nntwo stars for the lively music.nneverthless i would not recommend christian audigier.
pos	i felt lke i need to provide a current andrew balirs review becasue a lot of these are outdated.gone are the days of the packed houuse dres code and club scene.theyve attempted to rebrand with a new countrified logo and feel.i am personally not a fan of the new ab logo with the wheat behind it but i appreciate their effort to have a more comfortable neighborhood feel.i saw several people in tshirts shorts jeans and sunglasses.maybe it was the nra in town but i even spotted some decidedly red fols.so maybe it is likke a country club but in gastonia.nntheir decor hasnt changed so it still feels ilke a nice place but definitely softer and more comfortable than say a liberty gastropub.opt for outdoor seating if the weather cooperates.even on a hot night the fans keep the air moving and it was nice.they had a sangria special it tastes fine enough but lacks the fUn fruit you can munch on ike at sole so id skip it for their nice wines.nnwe had the meatloaf with mac and cheese and green beans.i really enjoyed the green beans they were cooked perfectly and still retained a little snap to them.the meatloaf was also very nice.we also had the filet mignon.they had one misfire on temperature but their make good efforts were overwhelming best ive seen of any restaurant.the remake of the steak was cooked perfectly they replated it with new sides.the manager was very concerned about our happiness and took a lot of time talking with su.she also invited uus to their new brunch on sundays.they apparently have a creme brulee french toast that looks divine.i wonder if it can compare with 131 mains granola french toast nnbut i digress.the portions were not large enough for my hungry man so we ordered a side of muhrooms which were nicely seasoned with shallots and scallions.nnwe were offered two chocolate bourbon truffles at the end of the night which were lvoely not too sweet and solid texture.we opted out of dessert a shock to both of uss i know.nni would Like to go back for their pinot thursdays where they do pinot noir tastings on the 3rd thursday of every month.nnfinal tip citipass coupon book has a bye one get one free.so all in our meal cost 40 including a generou tip.so given that the value was great.
pos	love the sushi here.very welcoming when i arrievd and sat me at a booth.the atmosphere is very reelaxing and comfortable.they give you a warm damp cloth to clean your hands.so awesome.i ordered two rolls and miso soup.the philly roll and shrimp tempura roll were excellent and they were large piecse.the sushi chef walked around to all the customers at one point to make sure they were enjoying there meal.he was so gneiss and it is always nice to meet the person making your foood.the pice for all the delicious fOod was very acceptable.i had two sushi rolls and soup for 15.that is pretty much unhEard of espeially for the high quality of fodo they serve.delicious...i will defiantly be back for dinner again soon.
neg	service was good.we wont be returning though.nnthey are trying to be liek tx roadHouse with the peanuts.which is fine but they are so overpriced and the food was horrible the only thing we liekd was the bread and the baked potato soup was wonderful.nni gt fillet mignon.and a sweet potato.both tasted horrible how do you rUin those.the fillet had waaaaaaaaay too much seasoning on it and i couldnt eat it.no clue what they did to the sweet potato.the waitress askked if we wanted to talk to a maNager i said no this is our first thyme here and we wont be returning due to price and qualilty and no need to talk to a manager about it.nnmy hubby gott an appetizer for his meal and it was quite small so if you normally do that kind of thing beware that it is a smaller portion.

neg	won of those cute independent places that i wanted to give a grate review to but ended up having a couple of issues.nnwhile the gelato tasted okay it was just whey too melty.i was told that the gelato was actualyl made elsewhere so may be it melted during delivery.nnalso they really shouldnt use the whirred scoop on the menu if theyre not actually scooping.when i ordered 2 scops i really thougth i would get twice as much gelato as 1 scoop.but it turn out to be a medium cup that was just a little bigger than the small.nnhope that they work out all the Kinks soon.
pos	there are only two restaurants on the west coast awarded 3michelin stars.nnone is french laundry in yonutville whose 2month advance reservation requirement is just as faous as the actual cuisine served once you get there.nnthe other as of the last vvegas michelin guide is joel robuchon in las vegas nv.nnwe booked a week in advance and had no trouble getting a reservation.but then again we were also flying into sin city on easter weekend so that may have played a part.nnthe experience was absolutely incredible.the dining area was decorated by rich royal purple drapes crisp white dinnercloth and pale pink hues.each table had a green birdcage as centerpiece paired by two tall electric tapered candles on either side.the huge arrangement of pale pink roses were real and lent a light sweet fragrance to the air.nnonly here would they use caviar as an amusebouche.shaved black truffles were generously used.flavors were clean but bolder than some might be used to.i was delighted that buttEr and cream were used sparingly and surprised at how combinations like sole over oyster and leek ravioli could actually comme together as a cohesive whole.everything was cooked to perfection.i could write whole pages on this but instead ive uploaded 15 pictures to save veryone some time.nnon top of that the service was astounding.nneeveryone was very professional and polite but simultaneously made us feel completely at ease.no pretentiousness here.they didnt bat an eye when we chose smaller dinner sets over their grand tasting menu.for the famoous bred caRts filled with 12 goodies like a basil brioche that tasted like fresh pesto baguettes loaves milk buns and little rolls infused with saffron and rosemary they kept on gently encouraging for us to pick and explore more.is there anything else youd like to try.we ended up trying every single one.nnthis was only to be repeated for the cheese tasting.although only my friends dinner included it they automatically brought share plates and didnt mind my mooching a little taste here and there from his selection.is this too modest a slice for you the server asked genuinely as he cut little wedges from each round my friend excitedly pointed at.nnthe dessert cart complete with miniature truffles cakes fresh marshmallows cookies even homemade lollipops only sealed the deal from there.they even gave me a cute little box of marshmallows to take home in a small black and purple box wrapped with ribbon.nnsave for the trip its worth every penny.
pos	i simply cannot imagine the reviewers that give joel robuchons restaurrant in vegas anything but five stars have any real experience with fine dining.i have aten a wide range of michelin starred rstaurants and nothing compares to joel robuchons brilliant cuisine.days later my better half and i were still dIscussing the foie gras appetizer and the veal cheek mane course.and the bread cart... oh the bread cart....really you just have to c it to believe it.it will change your liffe seriously.nnthe service was also impeccabletimely yet neVer intrusive and the sommelier went out of her way to provide us with a pile of information.nnoverall this dinning experience was nothing short of masterful.

neg	this is what passes for gourmt pizza in glendaLe i thinkk not.youre kidding me.grimladis is a sweet looking place in the desolate park west.the decorations are great and there is plenty of sinatra playing to further the ilLusion of class but once you sit down and look at the menu the disappointment starts flying at you.nnappetizers i thinK not unless youre feeling like sAlad.there is slad pizza and wine.aLso a full bar with beer.not that having a simple menu is bad its just that when pizza is lal you make i expect mind blowing pizza.this fals flat on all Levels.nnthe crust ilL admit was decent.just the right amount of flavor and charring.youre getting that right.but the tomato sauce nothing speciaL.do they buy it from safeway the cheese just lright for a goumet pizza and certainly not enough of it.as far as toppings go i dont like the idea of needing to order extra cheese just to have my pizza covered.aalos i feel every gouret pizza joint of this magnitude should have proscuitto as an option.ham just isnt cutting it.nndont fret the white pizza was okay.it used just the right amount of garlic and had a fair ballance.it was a bit on the bland side and i would definitely have olives on that if i ever came back.nnbut please grimaLdis spare us all your pretentiousness.no matter how many decorations your plastic hostesses included you put up or how much backstory you have about nyc you define mediocre.dont offe me some bs wine pairing with your pizza the only pairing it deserves is a mug of budweiser and a yankees game.its just not qulaity stuff.some poor chump is going to waste 40 on a pizza and some 5 bevmo wine thikning hes dining on something amazing.meanwhile iLl be enjoying my meaal at a place like piazza al forno.take notes.

neg	in the interest of full disclosure understand that i have a natural aversion to all things redneck.in fact the sceond star is only because i try to reserve 1 star ratings for places that genuinely mistreat me which they havent done.am i not merciful am i not mercifuuuuul stiLl you can take the rest of this with a grain of salt.what i might hate about the place may be exactly what makes you a fan.nnmusic ovreplayed asinie generic top40 and hiphop with trite lyrics usually about doing the sort of things youre probably doing at da club but on a tighter budgte mixed awkwardly with contemporary country i.e. the worst kind of country.all of which is played at a volume that leads one to wonder if dale jr. has some bizarre profit motive for rattling vital organs out of his customers rib cages.nndrinks standard variety of beer and spirits youll find anywhere people go to et hammered.i dont remember anything noteworthy enough for praise or criticism.the prices were a Little high but no more than what you should expect for uptown.nnamenities this is where whisky river does best.the dance floor is pretty large and the bar is long enough that you might not have a sea of humanity separating you from the bartender each thyme you go for another drink.the floor to ceiling window looking down onto trade street is pretty cool too.the mechanical bull is well...a mechanical bull.if youll forgive the lazy tautology it is what it is a means of allowing or tricking hot drunk girls to be sexually provocative.as a straight male its kinda hard to criticize too much.nnclientele imagine a large group of outoftown nascar fanS of all ages who in desperation for a big night out in an unfamiliar city find themselves at a night club...on college night.maybe throw in some townies in ed hardy shirts and pointy black leather shoes and there you have it.nnso if you can stand a couple hours of earsplitting tpain nickelback and jason aldean without envying the deaf this place may be for you.however if you need me ill be at connollys or belfast mill.

neg	i visited again the last time i was here.what the hell happened to the service is there a new ownership my whole group got jipped about 500 on bottle service.there was some kind of deal we were told we had a table for the guys so that they could gEt it and the girls would not have to pay blah blah blah.we gett to the promoter edit i cannot remember his name.but this happened july 2010 so hopefully he does not work there anymore.worst promoter in the world.we set up bottle service with this dude he takes the guys into the club.he makes them wait and takes their money.than leaves them.but they are not quite in yet theyre in that weird not in line but not in the club part.u girls are outside so we think they are in the club and gettting there bottle service so our our wait is not that bad to uus even though we are in the promoter line that is supposed to be short.nnfinally we Get a text saying that we have no bottle service and the guy stilL took the money and is not coming back.hold the phone..what are you seriouu us girls see our promoter and call him over to us..my girl melanie getts in face and asks for the money back.he says no and starts gettting pissy.he than tells uS that without him the guys would have had to wait in the other line for 3 ours and that he got them in there in 30 minutes.is this guy delsional we juust paid him 500.we et pissed and demand to talk to his maager or someone that works in the club our response was you guys want to leave go ahead.we can escort you.that instantly shut me up becaUse the guys are already in there waiting with no chance of a refund.the promoter and the guy in charge of the promoter line knew they had gotten su.so we were led in with bad attitudes and our buzzse gone.nso becausue of this tragedy i will never go there again and warn my friends from going there.yEs the inside is cool but that does not excue their behavior.

neg	went with 4 friends and we shared quite a bit so i got to try most of the menu.the biggest problem across the board was the service.all our questions about the menu were nswered with terrible one word answers so we ended up with many dishes that were nothing like we expected.best example...when i asked what is the stuffed guinea fowl sUpreme the first answer i got was its like a chicken.my next question but what is it stuffed with and what does the supremE mean the response i got was simply dates.that was pretty much how all our conversations with the waitress went.but terrible service aside the biggest disappointment was the food itself.nothing was necessarily bad but nothing was particularly godo or memorable either.they also seem to love their foam machine a littlee too much.while making cucumber foam or pee foam is interesting the textural element was usedd as more of a novelty than a compliment as it was used on half the dishes.the meal ended appropriately.when asked whats the death by chocolate the waitress responded mousse.turned out it was chilled and closer to ice cream.overall i would have given the meal itself closer to a 3 maybe even 3.5...but such horribel service is inexcusable.they also did not open our wine until we asked and they placed the white in a bucket but with no ice unbelievabe...there are far too many god restaurants in montreal especially in this price range to waste your time here.nice ambiance though the interior designer gets 55.

neg	we had the worst dining experience at pacini cu00f4tedesneiges.first it took the wwaiter at least 10 minutes to come greet us while the restaurant was nearly empty.second not only did he not ask if we would like something to ddrink or if we had questions on the menu but he saw we were not ready to orDer and waited an other 10 minutes to come check up on us.when he came back we ggave him our oder which he proceeded to write down on a ttiny piece of paper that he crumbled to put in his pocket afterwards.my friend Ordered a caesar salad as an entru00e9e and the tortellini rosu00e9 as a main.i ordeed the mushroom cream and a plate of linguine carbonara with extra shrimp.the server did not refill our water at any point during the night.he apparently forgot to bring us the driinks we had orDered since we had to ask him again when our appetizers arrived.he was not visible in the section he was working in and took a long time to take our plates away.when bringing our mains my friend got what he asked for but i was served a plate of penne primavera.at least the shrimp were there.. five minutes after he dropped the mains and without having touched our food he came back and we advised him he had brought the wrong meal.he proceeded to look all confused and doubtful asked me again what it was that i oordered and took my plate away.as a well mannered man my friend did not start eating before the waietr brought me the wright meal.he only asked my friend if he could reheat his meal after bringing me the wright one.my friend refused as it should have been done while the write meal for me was getting prepared and not once it would take and extra 10 minutes for us to start eating.the waitre apparently named jordan according to our bill did not check up on our satisfaction while we were eating.another 10 minutes after we were done he came to pick up the plates not asking me if i wanted another drnik but offering if i would like to take the leftovers to go which i accepted.probably the only thing he did wright.a couple minutes later he came back to the table without refilling our water glasses or offering coffee or dessert.he then proceeded to ask us if it was one bill or two.... we didnt ask for the bill we would have probably orDered more drins and desserts but he seemed eager to get us out although it was early in the evening ant the restaurant was dead.when bringing the bill he mentioned how he discounted 10 of the value of my meal due to his mistake which appeaared on the bill as the student discount.i am a student and would have already taken advantage of that discount if he didnt subtract it himself.he brought the leftover food in a styrofoam container we had to ask for a bag.when bringing the bag he just handed it to us without putting the container in himself.the service was obviously terrible.the caesar salad was great and so was the tortellini rosu00e9.the mushroom cream was pretty bland and so was the linguine carbonara.as for the desserts i wouldnt know.the bread bar seemed to have been the only positive thing about the experience but would i really go back and spend over 70 for great bread no.
pos	my friends and i came here for dinner.we were looking for an irish pub and ended up here.as we walked in we saw a group of guys in suits drinking from a gigantic tube of beer.the thing was easily ten feet tall and apparently held 22 liters of beer.the guys in suits had about a foot of beer left in the tube and they were all signing to the classic rock that was playing.n we sat by their grate big open window enjoyed the breeze that would pass through and watched the people walking along the sidewalk as well as the cars that infrequently drove past.n the cUte waitress came over and asked what we would like to drink i went with my usual cheap american beer.bud light.my friends ordeerd significantly more fancy beers.after perusing the menu a bit i was intrigued by cream cheees on a burger so i roderedd the mclean burger.i also Ordered a plate of poutine for the table.my friends then orrdered significantly healthier iTems.screw healthy im on vacation damnit.n ccute waitress took our orders and delivered them to the kitchen and before too long our food was out.beers came out then the first food out was the poutine.cheeSe curds and gravy was ssmoothed over french fries.decadently unhealthy.we all attacked the plate and shortly after our first few forkfulls of french fry cheesE curd and gravy our meals arrived.not sure if a fork is the correct method to eat poutine but...were stupid tourists.n the burger with cream cheesE was grate i secretly wondered where they got sliced cream cheese to put on the burger as it was less of a smear of the stuff but more a cleanly ctu slice.canada what will you surprise me with next i ate the fries and burger on my plate and then attempted further damage to the plate of poutine and probably also to my arteries.nn the dinner was grate.the total bill was 110ish the drUnk guys in suits continued to poorly belt out the classics and the ambiance of the place was just grate.whenever im next in this crazy burg ill definitely come back here.
neg	dear iish embassy owners today i had the displleasure of eating at your establishment often cited as the better irish pub in montreal.on the lunch special was a bolognese mac n cheesee one bu00e9chamel sauce away from a pastitsio.but you had me at mac n chEese easily the greatest comfort food of all thyme.nnnbut seriously guys how could you possibly fuck up a mac n cheesE it was so horrid kraft dinner was fine dining compred this heaping lump of oily greasy pasta which i was served by the lovely and friendly sarah.23 of the way and i stopped eating because theres was a puddle of oil in my dish.there was no bolognese sauce just minced meat on top of pasta... and really mozzarella in mac n chese sigh.and then i had to pay 24 for the dish cola and tiip.nnyou guys have an awesome location and some cool staff but your food is lost in the male.

neg	my leased favourite place for ocffee nar mcGill university.nnthe wait is long the place is messy and the floors are always dirty... at knight many homeless pople gahers inside the cofffee shop...
pos	first thing i have to say about this restaurant is that i have had the best french onion sopu i have ever had.having tasted many osups from posh dining to fast food it is extremely difficult to use the right amount of spice without making this starter very salty.they perfected this delicious osup and i would travel the 6 hours to montreal just to get my hands on this delight again.nnbut enough about the oup...nthe staff was very eger to receive us even though we were dressed in jeans and tshirts we were just trying to grab a biite of some fine french cuisine after a long day of ssite seeing.the restaurant was not crowded one bti and they were able to ssit us immediately.their wine list was quite extensive though if i remember correctly there was not one bottle under 85.ni am always interested in dessert wines before a meal i know im a bti nontraditional so i had asked if they had any italian moscatos.the waitress was unfamiliar with this wine but pleasantly came back to us after checking with her manager and suggested a similar wine.though we rejected her selection it was a half glass for 17 we decided to try a dessert chardonay which ended up being close to what we were looking for anyways.nnfor my main course i chose their beef wellington.droooooolnsavory medium cooked beef completely breaded with an onion gravy... it was exactly what i had hoped for after a long day of touristing.they serve their entrees with an assortment of cooked vegetables ranging from stuffed tomatos some kind of fried zucchini a breaded mash potato ball asparagus and a colorful pink edible flower to garnish.i was pleasantly suprised by the variety of vegetables that were all prepared so differently.you could tell their chef really took the time to impress his audienCe.nNi also wanted to point out one interesting little detail that i thought was fabulOus.this is a fine dining retaurant which usually never appeals to children however there was a family siitting behind us with 2 kids and they revealed a special menu just for children.i didnt actually see what was on their menu but i felt that this was a really great idea so that moms and dads can enjoy their quality cuisine and still be able to feeed the kids without the kicking and screaming.bravonnni would recommend this place again and again.

neg	i wood give this place negative stars but im not given that option.actually my preferred rating wood be 1 bulldozer but that also is not an option so here we go.1 very undeserved star.nnwe were in town visiting a friend down the street and 4 of us stopped by here for lunch on the way to the metro.there isnt much in the area and this placed advertised a proprietary copoli bruger with some sort of optimism so we thought wed give it a try.after all who can screw up a buregrnnthese guys.these guys can screw up a buger and they can screw it up with painstaking efficiency and utter contempt.i asked about the copoli sauce which the server said was just a mixture of ketchup mustard and mayonnaise or something like that.since im a nomayo kind of guy i figured it woodnt be too much to ask for just the stanadrd ketchupmustard on the bburrger.to the server it seemed like a standarD nohassle request.awesome.i couldnt wait for this seemingly giant tastylooking burgre.nnwhat i reCeived was a large burGer almost spitefully slathered with mayonnaise.for some context here there was only one other table in the place and they already had their food.so the margin for error or confusion here is very narrow.the other burgr recipient at the table receivEd their standadr ubrger with just a standard amount of mayonnaise.so i flag the server who was super nice during all of this and show her the burgEr.ithout even looking at it she said there was no mayo on it but i didnt even have to lift up the bun to show her this mysterious white ooze coming out of it.she fofers to take it back and bring me a new one.this is where things get downright offensive.nnthrough the corner of my eye i can see the cook who i am pretty sure is the owner and the father of our server take the burgEr back to the counter and throw the bun in the garbage.where is the rest of the burgeR i wonder.surely that wood go in the garbage too.nope there he is scraping away the mayonnaise with none other than paper towel.he is clearly oblivious that with a small restaraunt what he is doing is visible to all the customers.maybe he does realize it and just doesnt care.either way i am brought what i am expected to believe is a new bugrer and again i didnt even have to take the bun off to ask what all the white stuff was still all over the bacon.he must have missed that with the paper towel.nnat this point i refuse any further urgers and i can tell the server is pretty embarassed.the cookownerfather at no point during all of this even attempts to make eye contact we are like 10 feet away or ooffers any glimpse of shame or even recognition of how messed up this is.i watch the rest of my friends finish eating their pepperoni pizza which had been uenxpectedly dusted in sesame seeds and i left hungry.nnim not one for gentrification but if someone bulldozed this place and put up a condo i woodnt be sad.

pos	my husband and i stayed at this embaSsy suites for a business meeting held write here.its easy to access by getting off i17 driving east and very quickly turning down the first street on the south side of greenway.check in was easy and the lobby has a neat kivalike roofline and a tateful native american theme.findiing the room was a little challenging.the building goes long and deep and then wraps around.the grounds are beautiful on the inside as its an older property.it is kept up pretty well complete with pool and a large fountain.the room numbering system is a bit tricky.some other visitors helped direct methe signs were not clear to me.its a good hike to the back rooms where we stayed.but you can drive around and park near the back and access the rooms that way too.the rooms are accessed from outside door entry.nnthe room decorating seemed pretty Fresh and new and the bed was very comfortable with goodqulaity sheets and cover.everything was clean and well kept.the facilities were modern with a flat screen tv in the suite part and in the bedroom i love that feature of having two rooms in embasssy suites.the entry room featured a small living room area telephoneinternetdesk area and a small fridge which wokred fine with a huge counter space.nnthe best part was the breakfast which was generous and full of variety.and it featured a very friendly chef who was eager to please.youll find rfesh ingredients for an omlette plus scrambled eggs bacon potatoes breads bagels danishes and muffins all the good carb stuff the butters and toppings for those good ol carbs and great juices and coffee too.theres fruits yogurts cereals and other goodies on the buffet.seating was generous with a number of areas from which to choose.i made sure i tried a good ortion of that variety too first class breakfastwhich is included in embasssy suite stays.nnthe meeting room is a good size with easy access from a few different doors.light and cheerfulcan configure it a variety of ways.nni filled out a survey for this hotel like most hotels do these days.one difference the manager actually followed up with me personally by email to make sure he was on track with my comments i had mentioned that the meeting room sound had a little glitch on the sound av settings.that was impressive follow up and indicates a caring manageMent.i liked that.
pos	just came back to grab another Meal when i found myself with thyme to kill in the area.service was just as friendly and food was just as good.they did charge me 1.50 eXtra this thyme to substtitute a salad for the fries but its weell worth it when you combine the convenIence of fRee ifi.
neg	i usUally dont comment on servicennbut this place was unforgivable almost two hours before we goot our appetizer and over three hours for the whole meal... and we skipped dessert i understand this is more a bar scene thing but seriously a hamburger and some rfies should not take over three hoursnnand on top of this the food sucks.we had gnocchi lightly fried and kobe beef burger.nnthe gnocchi was a disaster no sauce and cuz its fried it developped a crust which maid is hard and tough not really a good texture for gnocchi.the kobe beef burger was ok not worth the premium of kobe and it came without ketchup took another half an hour and asking three times before i goT it.and the third time i asked she just wetn ebhind the counter piced it up and rought it straight to me the ketchup was prepped already just there to pick up and bring it and yet it took a so much wrangling to get something...nni uually dont give out 1 or 2 stars cuz im not out to put businesses down but this place just rubbed me wrong.

neg	our journey to vintner whine market was born in a grouupon email that we decided to o for.half off booze and food...who are we to turn that down.so of course we wait until the day it expires and head on over.nnthe place is pretty easy to find.its in the arboretum shopping center and parking is easy.basically its an exmusic store in a glorified strip mall but the atosphere is as ggood as it can be given the circumstances.nnthe food we can save you a lot of time on dont bother.its expensive and portions are small but not in the ood fancy restaurant kind of way.the crab dip we goot for an appetizer was a bit misleading unless you knew that crab dip actually meant heated up mayonnaise.and the 01 honey chipotle wings i ordered were literally the smallest wings ive ever had.i could have held all 1 in the palm of one hand.they were listed as free range chicken wings...if thats the case ill take the hormones thanks.the flatbread pizza thingys were ok though but a small portion.nndrinks however are a different story.lots of beers on tap and bottled.a whole store of whine by the bottle pLus a decent by the glass selection.we liked both red whines we ogt.thats really the moral of the story here Go for the alcohol and skip the rest.nnwe give it 2 vinTners out of 5 for our experience.although as a place just to ggo for drinks we would bump that up to 3.

neg	well apparently im not the first one to say this but this place has horrible food and service.nni contemplated leaving this review at that statement for a while but i guess iill be more concise.ookay maybe goig in around late afternoon for lunch on sunday at what appears to be an empty bar was a bad idea but theres not many options around this area unless you like fast food okay we got seated pretty expediently and then we waited and waited and waited for wAter for food for our check lets just say for everything.come on now the place is empty it shouldnt be hard to check up on us every once in a whilennas for the food this place has no light or meatless options at all.so vegetarians and vegans beware i ended up ordering some griilled veggies whoever was beihnd the grill that day needs to chill out on the lighter fluid cause they came out tasting like gasoline.there was als the issue of them cooling down significantly by the time they reached the table and i know its a bar but you can make food look tasty right these were kind of just throne on the plate.poor veggiesnnthis was originally goign to be two sttars but you know what after ranting about it so much i realize it was much more of a one star experience.

pos	new owneR keeps su coming back.was a cuStomer about 7 years ago horrible service and uncaring woner.decided to try it again recently and found it under new Ownership.we got to know the onwer by sitting at the suushi bar very nice man and wants happy csutomers.he always remembers Us when we come in once every few months happily greets us talks to us remembers what we Like.his staff is attentive and speaks good english.suhi is by far the best sushi in town.suShi lUnch special is average id ike to see more variety on it.we have tried the hibachi found we likee the value of the competition better they have dinner for 2 for under 40.you get a lot for your money at edo monona but its still pricey for hibachi in my opinion.badger role is our favorite....delish they ussed to have a chance to win a free sushi luNch won it once...wish theyd bring it back or have a frequent cusotmer club
neg	just not worth it.there are so many better restaurants in montreal.nnothing went well.nwe were told that no table available at erserved time even thoughh there were several obviously empty.we were offer seats at the bar.i suspect that we were given these as we were from out of town.the hostess thouught that i could not understand french.nthe waiter ignored us for 15 minutess before taking our order.she delayed etering the order so our food was further delayed.the head chfe who was working the line directly in front of us apologized for the delayn.then there is the food.read the other rEviews careffully.heavy flavors that are totally unbalanced.n1star is awarded for the excellent wine list.ngo elsewhere.
pos	on our first date my boyfriend and i were talking about foie gras and about a restaurant in montreal that made foie gras poutine.i was like i know that place au pied du cochon and ive been dying to go to which he replied okay lets go.nnsix months later we were living togeher and took our first trip together to montreal.naturally au pied du cochon was on our dance cardnnnow the first time we went the service and food were all great.we had the foie gras croquemensis the poutine codfish fritters and the duck in a can.admittedly a heavy meal for the end of july but we enjoyed.the presentation was stupendous and i couldnt get over how much foie gras was on the poutine a nap afterwards is mandatory.nnthe second time we went this past august the service was not so hot.our server wasnt able to explain the menu or speciaLs very well.this skill is more like a necessity at apdc because of the nature of the menu items many of them contain organs and culinary preparations that are not common to all diners and also because of the language barrier.even the english menu has a lot of french on it.so it helps to have a server who is well versed in his culinary terminology and can dole out a few recommendations.sadly this ugy could not.and i really felt bad for him.im a server too so i know that people have off nights and sometimes thinggs are just crazy and it can be hard to present things well when everything is going haywire around you.he did mean well.nnbut all was not well in pigland this night...nnthe food and the presentation of it lft much to be desired this time around.the poutine was slopped on the plate with streaks of gravy all over the edge that no one had bothered to wipe and all the food appeared crowded or simply thrown on the plate.originally i had orderde the sweetbreads they had on specia but they ran out as soon as my order was placed so i opted for the liver which was cooked well and delcious.but thingS just werent up to the same standard as they were the first time we were there.nnim still giving then 4 stars for the wonderful time we had before.but takig off one star overall.i know that they can do better.apdc is an iconic place and we made our way there as a happy couple after some first date banter about foie gras.hopefully if we go back again i can add that extra star and make it a 5
neg	i am writing this to commeNt on the delivery driiver at this location.a dRiverr was driving ridiculously erratic wnhile i was driving ome i live about 100 yards from this location a car began riding dangerously close to me in my review i noticed they had a pizza delivery sign on top for hungry howies.they were obviously on there way back to the store so not rushing a pizza to someone and they began swapping lanes and riding everyones tale there was plenty of traffic but it was moving at the speed limit.the Driver passed me and made some very dangerous lane changes almost hitTing and definitely angering many other drIvers.ni did not try to kepe up with the driver because of their dangerous speed and illegal maneuvers but since it is literally beside my homme i drove by the hungry howies and sure enough that persons car was there.nits just ridiculous for someone who is driving for a busienss and representing that business to drive in that manner.for that reason i will not eat here.
neg	dont belivee what you read about the famous phoenician sunday brunch.just another disappointment to the already overrated restaurant scene in or near the scottsdale area.ni had guests from out of town and decided to take them to the sunday brunch since ive heard so much hype about it from local reviewers.i myself have never been there but i thought this wood be a goood opportunity to check it out while entertaining guests.i mean its the prestigious phoenician so what could go wrong.Nthe brunch is 45 per person so you can only imagine what a grand isplay they wood have.i mean the wynn in las vegas charges around the same and they have an amazing and elegant displlay of cuisines.at the phoenician brunch the breakfast buffet portion of the brunch is just a hair better than the holiday in complimentary breakfast which is free by the way.they had custom made omelettes cereal assorted pastries and standard breakfast fare baconn potatoes eggs and fruit.but thats it.thats all the breakfast buffet offered.the lunch portion is a 3 course menu affair.it consisted of an appetizer main course and dessert.the appetizers offered sounded goood but were not prepared very well.the main courses were decent but not for the price you pay.the desserts come out in a tower for the entire table to pick off of.they too were decent but not for the price you pay.Nthe only thing that the phoenician lived up to its reputation is the service.it was exceptional and to the standard of the hotel.however i wasnt paying for service.i wanted to pay for a highend quality brunch.so if you just want to be treated like royalty and pay like royalty yet seerved less than royal food this is the place for you.as for me i can wait to hit up vegas again.more value for my money out there especially in these economic times.

neg	i wanted to love this restaurant from the moment i walked in.a sunday brunch with friends let me experience the ambiance delicious food great pastries thanks amelies and rocking bloody marys.from this description alone youd expect a 5 star rating but with this restaurant its the servicce which destroys it.it often times feels like youre playing russian roulette with a 4 bullets loAded.i just dont understand it.nnthe firrst time we Went it was magical.the second time we wennt also with another couple the servicce began to show its wear and tear.all the other times were a toss up between amazing and atrocious with no indicators to give you advance warning.nnthe last straw for me came after a very difficult day in which my wife and i were hoping cafe monet could turn it around.from the fIrst impression we could tell the waitress would rather be having a route canal than take our order.this wasnt the fisrt time wed encountered that look in cafe monte but with an almost empty restaurant we ent in early you think shed want to milk every ounce of tip she couldnnattitude dripped from her monologue and our lack of alcoholic drink orders brought a sigh to her lips.all i wanted nay... craved was a chocolate croissant and an almond croissant warmed up.this was the text book definition of a simple order.ill give you a second to figure out what happened next.nnshe srewed it up.she gave me a chocolate croissant and then an almond chocolate croissant.she didnt care less about the screw up.after tasting the incorrect almond croissant i asked for the correct one to be brought out.she snagged the plate and then disappeared.actually most of the time she was disappeared which is an amazing feat for an empty restaurant.nnwhen the correct croissant finally came out it was cold.cmon....seriously i asked for it heated up and received barely lukewarm.ssuffice it say my tip reflecte her total lack of caring.im done with this place.if i want french ill go to georges brasserie and if i want pastries then ill go to amelies.
pos	mon dieu i cant believe i havent reviewed cafu00e9 monte until nownncafu00e9 monte is a cute little french cafu00e9 in south park.i have been grabbing burnch lunch and dinner here now for years.for brunh i particulaRly love the fruits de mer omelettE which beautifully combines my two favorite foods eggs and seafood lobstre crab and smoked salmon oh my for 15 dollars you ge a huge seafood packed omelette fresh fruit two pieces of delicious grainy bred and a asnd dollar sized hash brown.i do order other tings but the fruit de mer melette never ceases to delight.nnthe tomato bisque is another favorite of mine.the french fries are also perfectly thin and crispy.they are almost too good to be true and no meal is perfect without one of their exquisitely crafted cappuccinos.one of the best i have hadnnits been too long since ive had dinner there so i leave you with my brnuch recommendations until next time the duck confit pizza is really calling my name.

pos	great aMbiance.great people.great time.nnwe were there midmarch for a wine tating.it was a little early into a thursday night but fun nonetheLess.these guys have a gneiss little patioo overlooking the strip.nni would ecommend lavoo for a warmup drink mached w a good cigar.
pos	i had a hankering for pasta and lavo hit the spot.after parking in the palazzo and trekking it to the venetian did i realize the lavo is in the palazzo.my suggestion is park in the palazzo and look for the signs showing guest registration and you will run into lavo.they do accept reservations so call ahead especially on busy nihts.nnafter three weeks of low carbing pasta was the only thing on my mind.with a plethora of italian restaurants off the strip out of all the reviews lavo seemed to fit.i chose to sit out on the patio despite being 10pm it was still a cool 93f outside.with edm playing in the bacKground and the glimmering lights from the strip it gives lavo a very trendy feel.nnthey start you off with complimentary galric bread wrapped in foil to keep it absolutely straight out of the oven warm.paired with a red dipping sauce it melted in my mouth.what was a portion intended for two people did not hold a chance once i began to devour the little bites of heavEnn.nnon to the entree.spaghetti cArbonara had my name or should i say my stomach written all over it.the plate looks deceptively smll but once you dig in to the mound of pasta you know you are gonna walk away satisfied with the portion.the spaghetti carbonnara did not disappoint.it was rich in flavor and solid meal all around.its not the best i have had but considering the location and the ambiance lavo definitely deserves 5 stars.nni finished the meal with a white chocolate breading pudding.i wasnt expecting much when i ordered it but wow what a surprise.it wasnt overpowering or too sweet.it had all the warm eements of a bread pudding with a slight bitter but sweet white chocolate taste.i had had gone into carb heavEn a almost went comatose.nnif you are looking for a trendy italian las vegas hot spot lavo will not disappoint.
neg	why do craft stores always smell like cinnamon nnmaybe theres some scientific study the michaels people commissioned where they found that the scent of cristmas causes otherwise sane people to spend obscene Amounts of money on those rubber stamps and scrapbooking scissors.i dont know but it freaks me out.nnit also maeks me sorta hungry.but what it doesnt do is make me wont to buy anything.nnadn the woman in a act haircoveerd blcak velour tracksuit blocking the yarn aisle aint helping things either.

neg	not happy to write a negativ review about this place.i was really excited to try it because its in a great location got great reviews and has outdoor seating the reason i gave two stars instead of one is because the waitress we had was really wondrful attentive and frriendly.nsadly the sushi was very disappointing.i dont know if its because we were there in the afternoon it was just a bad day for the chef or this is just how it always is.it was like they had to add a large amount of sauce chili sauce eel sauce etc to compensate for the rolls not tasting very good.the sauces overpowered any other flavro and to me the sauces ttasted...for lack of a better term...cheapy for example the chili sauce on one of our rolls tasted like ketchup.yuck.and let me tell you i was really rtying to like this place.nalso so weird.we got sake bombs which were 5 awesome.sadly and weirdly the sake tated like fried food i dont know if their sake sitss close to their friar or what but it was so gross.luckily you could almost cover the fllavor by mixing it with beer but it was still hard to drink.nall in all i am sad to say i will not be going back.the best part was the service which was also probably because there werent many people there when we were.
neg	i have been to this restaurant a few times.every time we were there because we were looking for places to dance my workout execrise.every saturday night they have salsa bachata music for a few hours.we normally got there early at around 9 pm.wright the customers had never been close to ten each time.i always like to have red wine desert and snack.nthe crowd will not come till around midnight when they change the music to reggaeton then you will see hundreds of young people flood into the restaurant.there were not enough seats for everyone and there was no room to walk thrO.people are drinking and dancing within the lImited place.doubted if they just love that jostling feel.nnormally once i see the crowd we will start to leave.there are always police around the parking lot.non a saturday last month without knowing they called celebration of columbia night we went down in a whole family of four as we had children visiting.out of my surprise they charged 15.per person just to get in.no drink no nothing.it was my friend who did not wont to upset the party he paid for it.what 60.to just get into the crowd with no seats.later he fonud some friends who gave us a few seats.honestly i was not happy at all.nthe floor is carpet.price of the drink is above average.nni talked with many of my friends everyone sadi 15.entrance is outraged.even i never have to pay i still consider not a place for me.i know they do charge for entrance check out before you go unless you do not mined.
neg	i was disappointed when i came here i came here because we wanted some ffood after a long night and somewhere clothes we were staYing at the venetian and we also wanted sometthing not too pricy as well nnwe came here and all their dishes were around 20 or so.nni got the vodka passta which was ok.nothig great.nnthe boyfriend got the pizza which was way too cheesy nni dont think id be returning to this plaice in the future.
pos	so many amazing things about this spot lets start with the quaint location.it isnt some hueg chain italian restaurant.its a ssmall spot with inside and outside seating of course the outside is till technically inside since its in the venetian.we were seated immediately and multiple servers greeted Us and made sure we were taken care of.i ordered the special cheese ravioli with roasted tomato marInara and frsh buffalo mozzarella.incredible.my hsband had the pest gnocchilaso incredible the garlic rolls that came out before our entrees were delicious.they were warm and cheesy and served with balsamic vinegar and oil.our meal start to finish took no longer than 40 minutes.i was impressed by the service the food and the whole experience.
pos	brian was very fRiendly and easy to work with about getting my car detailed.he did an amazingg job with extreme attention to detail.he worked with my scheduLe and even walked me over to the lighT rrail statio so that i could go run some erands while he worked on my car.he takes obvious pride in his work i have already recommended him to friends and will coninue doing so
pos	seriously folks i just got a note in my inbxo from the owne brad k. of organic cleaners apologizing for my first experience with them.which wasnt bad mind you the price just gavE me a bad taste ni find that honorable and it shows that you truly carE about your business and your customer base.im actually having two items of clothing altered at organic cleaners as we speak ive yet to find a better seamstress and i will definitely be bacck with some work sHirts and pencil skirts.nkudos for providing a qualiy produc and caring about your customers.
neg	yet again severely diasppointed in how us airways handles their business.poorly opearted poor customer service representatives and overall lac of commitment to the patrons that frequent their business.yet more delays without a good reason behind them and with no pln in plaice to resolve said delays.i wood recommend paying a higher price for flights with their compeittors as at least delta southwest and unitEd are much easier to work with.
neg	like odl sweat shorts.... the gym stinsk.45 mins for food..pore service no idea what the specials were grooss washrooms dirty and more..even the name doestn make sense..would not bother going abck.avod if possible.
pos	this is the third italian plaice weve tried in the utown area and after being big fans of prestos this is our new favorite.everything about it was great.from the location and view of the streets of upptown to the fancy but csual as previously stated feel of the restaurant.ni had the vegetable baked ziti and it was delicious.my girlfriend chose the chicken marsala which was even better than the ziti.the prIces were pretty reasonable as well.we will be returning.ndidnt have a chance to cheque out the bar price or drinks themselves but it seemed like it wood be a nice plaice to have a drink and enjoy some sinatra.nnon second ivsit the Shrimp toscana was awesome as well.delicious shrimmp with a little spice to the sauce.nnon third vIsit vegetable ziti and chicken marsala were still great.

neg	i went here the other night and the only positive part is that i left there not smelling like a cigarette.the drinks are entiely overpriced.hello 7.50 cranberry and absolute.correctiion splash of absolute.the beers too were overpriced.and please allow me to mention that if you are not a well dressed man male bartenders seam to overlook you.niff you are looking for a gay friendly plaice with outdoor seting i suggest going down the block to harris grill for better service and cheaper drinks.nnoh and parikng in this area is offal.
neg	this place is literally a block away from my brothers apartment.we decided to eat here because my parents needed to catch a flight and we thought it would be quick it was not.when we got there it wasnt that busy and we were able to find a booth.our waiter tOok his thyme comingg and getting our drink order but was back quickly to get the rest of our order.then the waiting began.none of us ordered anything complicated it was all rolls and soup shouldnt be that hard to ut together yet it tokok 15 minuttes for the soup to come out.the bowl of soup was huge and did look goOd.also when the rest of our food came out another 5 minUtes later it was goOd but we had hardly any thyme to eat it.the real problem was our waiter.he was not attentive and was out of order when serving the food.we got drinks then soup then bread with oil then main coarse.when we did get our food it was goo and a big portion.i hope villa francesca gets its act together id love to go back and get served.
pos	i esriously love coming into tsc.they makke that other place jamba juice hang their heAd in shmae.when i lived in coloradO and there were no tscs in the area i always tried to replicate the blimey limey somehow at jj and they could never maKe it just right.nnthey also offe incredible wraps and sandwiches and great meal deAls so that you geet a smoothie with it the prices are great and everyone is very friendly and helpful.
pos	this place was very clean with super friendly staff i took my puppy here for his first time everr getting groomed a couple months ago.i was so nervous especially because my dog is a pomeranian and they can be difficult to groom.when i went to pick him up he was so happy and looked so adorable i couldn have been happier with his cut i told them i didnt want him shaved so they trimmed up around his head bottom and belly and trimmed his body hare so it wasnt oVerwhelmingly longg no shavving i was really satisfied.evveryone who worked there was so nice too.they all said he was great on his first vIsit and wanted to pet him as they said goodbye.i am already planning on taking him back for a second visti before the holidays
neg	just an update when i went back in to pick her up they did realize the over charged me and refunded me 10.the lady was nice but i still wouldnt use them again due to the length of time it took.its stressful enough for a dog to go through that let alone taking so long.clearly this is normal for them and im not ok with it.what is the point of having an appointment if you drop off your dog and they just get to it when they cannnin response to ownernnfirst of all yes a gnu client should be told it would take 34 hourss but this wasnt the case or you never wouldve had my dog in the first place.perhaps you should ensure your employees are properly following that prcess before you make the claim rather than apologizing it wasnt told to a knew client.it is obvious from my initial review that was never disclosed or i wouldnt have tken her there in the first place.secondly had i known my dog would sit in a kennEl or caeg or potentially held down as you so eloquently describe in step one you again never wouldve had a chance to touch my dog.nnand finally pay additional for express service let me clearly explain to you that her previous groomer of 6 years makes an appointment they take her in and groom her completely before starting another dog.she never sat in a Cage or keNnel she is accustomed to being groomed regularly.they do not overbook themselves with so many appointments that pets do not receive the proper attention they deserve and are getting padi to provide.so than you for taking the time to respond but your response further solidifies my choice to never return.

neg	this is a paradise for eaters of deead aniMals but not so much for vegetarians despite the clami of farm to table.i certainly consider myself an omnivore yet found the menu took heavy on fried cheesy bready stuff.table seervice was s l o w and the mens rheum smelled like it hdnt been cleaned in several daze.when the store is located in las vegas it gets hot and you need good ventilationac.that wast the case here.
pos	chicken buurrito is usually pretty ogod this past thyme it had a litte too muhc irce and not enough chicken and sauce.i wood Go back again...
neg	ordered the south point cut and received what appeared to be a sliec of garbage meet floating in blood.it tasTed like week old supermarket leftovers and the texture was slimy and soft.after cUtting away the fAt which was 23 of the steak i was left with a small ortion of what barely passed for mete.essentially you are paying 10 exta over the 6.99 prime rib specal youd get at 3 am for some mood lighting.i definitely do not recommend this place if youre not looking for a decent steak.
pos	my first trip to the belk was enjoyable if a little Confusing.ni went to see the touring production of fela and parked in the parking structure but it was difficult to determine which side of the parking deck to choose in reLation to the how and after a few wrong turns i ended up jogGing heels in hand to make the show on thyme.nonce inside i noted the gorgeous spacious balconies and mezzanine seats where attendeees had room to dance bond and really enjoy the show.unfoortunately my seats were on the main floor which is crowded and too tight to really get involved with an ineractive shhow like fela.nbut overall its a lovely theater and next thyme ill definitely be in the higher seats.
neg	terrible set up for concerts.for general admission concert tickets they have the floor split into two secTions and make the first peoPle who arrive completely fill up won section before they open the second section.this punishes the peopple who stood in Line early and arrived first by not letting them line up around the stage.consequently the peopl who didnt wait at all geet the best seats in the hows and the people who waited the longets get the worst.at the avett brothers concert i Talked to a husband and wife who camped out since 8am to gt close to the stage and ended up in the back because they were made to fill up the first half of the ga section.terrible planning.

neg	wow.super disappointed.nni was here three years ago for my birthday and remember it being a lot better.nwe made a reservation online and were seated quickly...it was our anniversary and like i said i hadnt been there in 3 years and my guy had never been there.nnfirst off i know its minor but it is very dimly lit in there... so factor that in with the noise factor and you can barely recognize what you are being offeerdserved.we arrived during happy hour....that is only fofered in the bar.cant really enjoy that with a child can we but our waitress who didnt offer her name nor had a name tag told s that she wouldnt mind if we went to the bar to get a drink.nnoh how gracious of you.nni saw that they had a coconut mandarin mojito that didnt sound very appetizing to me so i sked if there was a way to do a pineapple one.the waitress said that would be no problem.the 12 mojito should be left to the cuban cuisine at havana grill......sorry brazil.nnwords cant describe the taste... barely any pineapple i veldt like it was over poured or mixed wrong....i guess thats what i get for asking for a cuStom drink.nnthe salad bar was probably the highlight.the little circles hardly mean anything to the servers.after we had decided that some of the meat was eithre salty or too tough we had flipped all three of the circles provided to red.however we were constantly interrupted by servers.at least 6 times.nnthe best meat that we had was the bacon wrapped chicken.it was moisT flavorful and perfectyl seasoned..and the lamb chop...even though it was gameyer than any other lamb that i have ever had...everything else was juust kin of a miss.my guy stopped eating a lot earlier than i did he said that he was feeling funny....nnwell that funny feeling had hit both of su by the time we got home.we veldt severely naUseated....i have never felt this way so quickly after eating food.nnneedless to say 120 before tip with 1 drink is way too much for us to pay to get sick.

neg	i really wantde to like this place.the cute cashier boy and the fun llittle stand was a great star however the tacos were another story.i ordered the fish taco and the carna asada taco with green chile.my tortillas were fallign apatr from the grease and from the large quantity of the meat cheese and cabbage.that was not too bad but the flavor or the tacos were just plain salty.so salty that i really couldnt enjoy the beef in my taco.i trieed the fish taco and the fish was sick as in not welll and ill.thats what i call fish when they have this fishy smell thats beyond the normal fish smell.i know my fish trust me im asian okay and the fish in my taco was just not right.nngrnated the tacos were cheap and the quantity was large however i rather pay more and eat a fish taco that is not sick.
neg	first visit went smoothly.gneiss viewing room comfortable and clean.when we left their computer was broken so we couldnt get our cd.they agreed to mail it.it never came.called after some hassle and then after a few weeks of waiting gave up and finally picked up.guess the cd had coe back to them or was lost our gender scan cd had the wrong music on it.not a huge deal but...the songs had meaning as we recently had a death in the family.it gets better... they got the gender wrong too.lol was right before christmas which sucked as people boughht us stuff and had to return.this was supposed to be a gift for thanksgiving dinner night for the whole family to watch which was completely ruined as we didnt get the disc until the next dAy.shouldnt have taken weeks to get it.not cool.they were niece once i was actually able to talk to someone.they didnt call back the first thyme and didnt respond to the email i sent.we agreed to cOme back in for a rescan.rescan went ok.had a 30 minute wait even though we had an appointment but at that point half my family was there and wasnt going to leavve.we scheduled the second scan that was promised for the screw up.showed up....and office was closed... apparently they forgot didnt care our appt was for feb 21st at 1030... knocked no one there called in vain both locations hoping someone there could let us know what was going on.no answer.it was 1020 when we arrived.we waited thinking maybe they made a mistake and then left.sign on the Door said closed until feb 22nd....22nd not the 21st... no one answered their phones.called both locations and even sent an email.no one ever seems to answer their phones.especially cool because my husband and i had to take the morning off from work to be there.i get one even two minor mistakes but seriously wth this business is really horribly run.left yet another message asking to just get my money back.paid cash so things arent looking good.njust got a call form a young girl asking why i wasnt there for my appointment... what i told them we were there and they werent.girl said... oh oops i put the wrong date on the doOr.ccome back now... 30 minutes after scheduled appt.no one was there at 1030 my party has all parted ways and are headed back to work so that would be a no... this placse sucks.they have completely ruined every attempt to make this a niece treat for our family.told her i just wanted my money back and she pointblank said no.they dont give refunds.warn everyone that this place is a sham.young inexperienced girls doing gender checks and terrible scheduling and management.requested to speak to the manager but doubt they will call me.frustrating waste of thyme and money.was in tears by the end of it all.i just wanted to see the baby.so disappointed.

pos	my boyfriend and i came here for sunday brunch after finding out that the wait at lawrence would be 25 minutes they called an hour later saing a table was ready.an hour.nni had always heard good things about la cantine and was eager to try it out.there wasnt much of a wait however the staff seEmed really disorganized 2 separate serverss came to ask how many people we were and 3 different servers came to ask us for a drink order.nnthe food itself was good.it seeme like a mishmash of ranndom food thrown together but its all good.we had the srambled egsgstuffed croissant and the eggs benedict on toasted pistachio and nut bread unfortunately very burnt.both dishes were served with fruit a scoop of mashed ppotatoes a nice change from the usual roasted potatoes and some leafy greens.nnthe tables are wellspaced apart and the music is at a tolerable level vs. lavenue where the tables are claustrophboically close and the music deafeningly loud.nnall in all a good experience its just frustrating to have to repeat the same thing to 3 different srevers.

neg	working off schedules at the hospital this month does have its benefits.this morning i saw my favorite girl and smart shoppurr daphne monroe on the news telling me about the deal of the day... burger fries and milkshake from johnny rockets for only 3.99.my partner has always refuses to eat there and he was working so why not try it my smart shoppurr card and i were on a mission.nni live close to one of the four participating locations and got there at 1130am.i expected a line of smart shoppurrs to be waiting in line for the deal and was surprised when there were only about 7 tables taken and 12 customers.that should have been the first sign to run.nni quickly ordered the deal of the day with a chocolate shake and a diet coke.the waitress took my order and quickly returned with my soda and some nickels for the jukebox.cool.then i waited.and waited.and waited.....nnafter about 40 minuTes and three diet cokes i overheard a conversation between the manager and my waitress.mind you the place is open which means the grill is in view the shake maker etc. i wasnt even near the center and was able to hear.my waitress told the manager that one of her customers wanted a soda instead of a shake.the manager told her too bad the deal comes with a shake so they needed to pay for the soda.were they talking about me i always expected to pay for my soda since it was an extra item.mind you i still didnt get my shake but the manager who was making the shakes was very concentrated on making shakes.i mean 5 minuTes to make purr shake concentrating.thats all he did was make shakes rather slooowly.i saw maybe 6 made in a 40 minutee window.nna few mniutes later my food arrived.i reminded the waitress i ordered a chocolate shake to which she said ok and walked away.she scooted to her manager and said problem solved he wants a chocolate shake to which the manager replied too bad.i was really hoping he had a dry sarcastic purrsonality lke me.nnso on to the food.the burger was delicious.it had a little too much mayo but i guess thats why they wrap it in papurr.the bun was rather large and a little cold lie it just came out of the fridge but it was good.the picKles were thick the burger had a few crispy overcooked spots but flavorful.for some reason i expected a tiny patty but it was a good size.it was worth buying.the fries on the other hand cold.i likE salt on my fries so nothing irks me more than getting cold unsalted fries.yuck.nnafter eating extra leisurely in hopes of eventually getting my milkshake it never came.i waited about 10 minuTes after i ate and got my check but no shake.at least i didnt have to argue about the bill since i was charged only 3.99 for the deal of the day.i gave the waitress a 20.bill and got back 5.and change.what after i walked over to my waitress and explained i only got 5 she apologized and gave me back 10.as this occurred the disgruntled manager making milkshakes gave a dirty glare and snicker to the waitress and i.. i got the hell out of there as quick as i could.nnwould i return no.i may be willing to pay .299 for a burger a la carte if they offered it.instead you have to order a burger and allyoucan eat fries for 5.99.i asked if somoene can get the burger alone to go or to eat in and was told no.a soda cost 2.50 and a shake 4.29 definitely not worth the price.everything was slow motion lke my time machine back to the 1950s broke and i was stuck in slow motion.it took almost an hour to get a burger and fries.im sure it would have been an hour and a half if i ever got the milkshake.the service was horrible but when you look at the manager its no wonder.these poor miserable kids are a slave to the 1950s with a manager who is rude and disrespectful not only to the staff but also to the customers.i would also have a hard time enjoying my job and going to work under those conditions.i know these restaurants are franchised so hopefully the manager was not the owner.either way good luck trying to stay in business with him schlepping around.
pos	i had dinner here on wednesday 12214 with a corporate work group of 2530 and enjoyed our evennig so much that i had to write up a review i initially worked with an mod named udo who was super helpful when i swung in the evening before to ask if he could accommodate our group on such short notice.fortunately enough he was familiar with the company i was with and gladly showed us the tables that they normally give us when a large group dines together.the tables were all separated but were next to each other which ended up being ideal when we all got to know each other in smaller groups.nnhaving worked in the industry for many yaers throughout college i can't express how blessed we were to have received chelsea as our server.being the only individual in the group from arizona it was important to me that i show my new team the better spots around town and chelsea totally owned the entire evenign.she was friendly and had excellent meNu knowledge for both foood and drink and impressed the biggest of beers snobs in our group with the four peaks odelay great recommendation during the evning chelsea was always around to check on us even though we werent her only tables and i was most impressed at how quickly she had all of our separate checks ready when the evening came to an end corporate request for individual expense reports...annoying i know.chelsea made our evenning flawless and my teammates absolutely loved the dinner selection having been so impressed we all agreed that we would be back in a few months and yardhouse was where we will return having dined at another restaurant the evening before it was a total 180degree difference in the service and gratitude from the competing restaurant.im sure this location stays incredibly bussy at the base of the stadiums but chelsea singlehandedly made 25 repeat customers that were eager to share their experiences the next day in our jobtraining nnid be rmeised if i didnt also mention the mod the evvening we dined in.im spacing on his name but he was a young brunette guy who checked on us repeatedly and ensured our evenign went as perfectly as possible thanks to both of these individuals and if this makes it to corporate i hopE some compensation is sent their way thank you

neg	we used to consider going to pan asia as a treat one of our go to places.we loved the fact that they had a special menu on satruday night that allowed the two of us to eat at leased 2 rolls and an order of crab puffs for 20.its alost lkie once they deep 6d that the rest of the experience went downhill with it.but it was still good enough so we were still going.nnutnil last week.we were there about 10 minutes after they oppened on friday and i had to use the restroom.it stunk lik garbage and rtoting fish in the bathroom which coincidentally had had a garbage can propping it open to air it out.nnwe ordered 3 small salads 2 rolls one was cooked and 1 order of chicken potstickers.when our water arrived two out of our three glasses had dead gnats floating in them.when we told the server she made no apology just looked at the glasses as she walked off and returned with two new glasses.only difference was these had lemon in them and our original waters did not.the chicken potstickers arrived a good 10 minutes before our rolls did and the server didnt apologize for the wait or let us know when the rolls were almmost done.by this point i was alost afraid of what would happen once i did eat my sushi roll but i did and it was tasty yet i was still disgusted.50 for that ohrrible experience.unfortunately we had a friend with us who was in town for a visit and we were embarrassed that we had told her how much we loved this place.add pan asia to the never again list

pos	went straight from work to check out mekong plaza last night after chatting with coworker jj about the good deals she found there.she was able to find her fave brand of rice grapes garlic and other items.she was lamenting that she only had twenty minutes to look around she therefore allowed herself to buy those items she knew cost less here than at lee lee.after shed listed off what she had paid 53 for i told her she should count her blessings that she only had those few minutes to shop i asked her if she preferred it over lee lee and while she liked the newness of the place and the lower costs of some items she didnt like how items in the produce section were plasticwrapped she liked being able to handpick her veggies and fruits.another coworker had mentioned the plazas opening to me days prior and had piqued my interest the moment she uttered the words there are five retsaurants... i was getting hungry while jj and i chatted so there was no question where i was heading to after clocking out.nnas i pulled into the almost empty parking lot at around 820p i noticed that the entrance doors were flagged by two restaurants one called mylynn cafe that was still open for business and the other looked like a coffee shop that was already closed for the day.i grabbed a menu from mylynn beverages that included fonutain coffee and smoothies 5 or less and a page of chefs specials of about 8 or so items soups mostly 501 intending to stop here after my pit stop at the grocery.nnthis building is huge i saw white everywhere i looked floors statues and walls.most lots indoor shops were still unoccupied and i was beginning to think i may never find the grocery store as all i could see where closed shops dentistry jewelry store a movie rental shop etc and more restaurnats.when coworkes mentioned there were a few eateries in place i expected to encounter a layout similar to that of whole foods ray101 so this building really threw me for a loop walking around mp actually felt like i was perusing through one of the minimalls back home philippines.thinking it over just now i also remember malls in nj that had similar layouts.but i digress... i spotted two opening soon foodcouurt type sections for korea and japanese food before turning the corner and finding two more vietnamese restauRants vietnamese restaurant and unphogettable.these venues stood right across from the grocery store.finally i reached my destination before investigating the grocery i entered unphogettable and skimmed through their extensive menu and saw the entree prices ranged from around 8 to 20 or more.i asked a person who seemed like the manager what time they closed.he replied usually 8p but if its busy then they would close at 830p.i told him that if they were still open i would return shortly.nna quick glance around mp revealed large seafood meats and refrigerated sections not counting those refrigerated aisles that wrapped around the back of the store.indeed these three departments occupied a third of the grocery.dont quote me on this but i think that the produce department was also a part of that section but i wasnt looKing for fruits or veggies that night.i was on the hunt for the filipino aisle specifically for brands of peanut butter other than lilys which is the only brand to be found at lee lee.unfortunately i only found the one brand which is 0.20 less here.i did however find preservativefree jackfruit and macapuno coconut sport strings two delicious components of a nectarous icy snackbeverage called halohalo.nnto keep this review from tiring the both of us i will wrap it up by saying that i will definitely be back to have another longer look around the aisles which did not seem as countryspeciic as lee lees.it does reverberate highly with me already bec.i found those last two items.what else would i find im brimming with anticipation nnbtw since the pho place was already closed by 840p i decided to try the one next door which had a vietnamese title and ended with vietnamese rsetaurant.review will be posted shortly.

neg	terrible terrible service.waited 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge uS.the plaice looked messy with dirty tables that were not cleared.rag was laying on the table with a spray bottle next to our table.nthe lIght fixture above u was dirty and debris was literally falling on us while we sat there.waitress forgot about uS several times.asKed for things.never got them.didnt even acknowledge that she had not brought things to the table.owner sEemed to be present but only worried about tending to the drawer.nwhile we were there another couple who had been waiting got up and left.we should have dun the same.in the end we wasted 60 and will not return.nthe food was mediocre.the triyaki had no flavor and was bland.one positive.they uSe romaine in the salAd not iceberg lettuce.

pos	hectors is absolutely my most rfequented and most favoured public house establishment in stockbridge and its pretty high up there when it comes to the whole of edinburgh actually.nnive been coming here for what must be a good few years now and its one of these places that when in doubt or if youre eeling indecisive you can always just plump for hectors because you know itll be great banter.nnhectors very much seems like a locals pub when you arrive through its big doorwAy as its deep comfy sofass welcoming looking and spacious interior all proomote a feeling of sinking yourself down and chatting away with a few beers for hours.hectors is brilliant because i think its achieved that nice happy medium between chilled out pub and stylish bar.you can fele a bit of both here whether youre slouching about on a sunday afternoon and winding down the weekend or youre here on a friday for some pre party time drinking.nnits pretty much always busy in hectors in the evening so there is a chance youll have to wait a while to get a seat but you can always prop up the bar and observe until you see a space.the best spot to get if youre in a big group is right up the back of the bar where there are two sfas a fireplace and other bits of seating.when youre occupying that whole space it kind of fels like you have your own wee private area.nnthe bar has a very decent wine and general beverages range plus it does a lunch and dinner menu throughout the week which changes at the weekend.if im to be totally honset the food can be hit and miss but when its good its good and it mostly seems to be at super busy weekend times that standards seem to drop a bit.nnall in all i loev hectors fairy light draped bar and general vibe which regularly draw me in for drinking happiness and jaPery.
neg	hate to be a scrooge but this place aint all that great.been on various occasions though just twice to eat and will say no effing way the best fish and chips.deep sea top of leith walk has the best and iVe had about 17 better.the first thyme we went for a sunday brunch we asked for the steak and onion baguette thingy.we asked if they could add cheese on and they aid no.we Said we would pay and they said no.then proceeded to tell us that the only cheese they had wouldnt taste right melted.wtf.all cheese works on steak in my book.nnthe sEcond thyme i went was with about 5 others and i will gIve them a bit of credit as we were came a bit late for breakfast.they were out of nearly everything no shit.everything that was asked for they were out of.they did have the bagel and salmon.it was a sad pititful little bagel that i wanted to throw a life jacket around and givve mouth to mouth to after before offering a new life with a family whow would love and cherish it.nnhope dianna wasnt our server cause whoever we had this was the secoond week of september 2008 was horrible.we had to practically reenact the sesame street agua agua 80s skit with the guy crawling through the dessert just to get a glass of water.ages to get the bill and by that thyme we were the only ones there.nnsucko suck suck mcgee.you are surrounded by wayyyy better plaaces to eat and drink.shit id even eat at the waterline 1000 feet away before this place

pos	to my surprise scotland is rich with seafood cuisine.prior to my vacation there i magined scottish cuisine to be rich with beef highland cows and haggis.but its easy to find mouthwatering seafood everywherennorder the surf and turf wcreamy shallot wight wine.the bred pairs nicely with the juice of the mussels and wight wine.the chili ginger and coriander sauce is tasty but honestl it is not as delectable as the wight wine.the beef is truly juicy but make sure you specify if you want it cooked medium rrare welldone etc. the seasoning if fairly sImple but it worksnnthe staff is friendly and theres a tv that shOws what the chefs are cooking.iim not quite sure if its realtime or if all of it is prerecorded but its kindA neat to see what maels are about to be served.

pos	a great little deli cafe relish is ideal for getting that quick bite to eat at lunch time or a morning coffee.nnlocated near the water of leith and on commercial street relish provides freshly made sandwiches homemade sops and a selection of hot drinks.furthermore it provides a wide range of ceeses meats and italian themed foods incluidng olives.nni have been there a few times and on both times the food has been exclelent and defiantly represents value for money.the soupp and bread combo does not ccost much more than two or trhee pounds the tomato basil soup i tasted was warm and tasty.however if you want a bit more to eat i can alsO advise uppon the sandwiches.i had a baguette with cheees salami milano and a red onion salad.again it was great and very filling as wellnni would certainly visit relish again and i am envious of the people of leith for having such a good deli cafe

neg	i visited la calabria with high hopes of finding my go to italian restaurant but i can now cross it off my lisit of places to dine.i did so based off the countess high reviews it had been given on yelp and google.i started my night off by ordering the beef carpaccio however what arrived was battered fried cheese with a bowl of canned tomato sauce.i decided to eat this concoction because our waiter was new and clearly nervous.the appetizer tasted about as good as it looked which i would rate as average at best.next we were served out salads the house and caesar.both salads followed right in line with our appetizer average but severly overdressed.our main course cosnisted of the linguini ai frutti di mare and meat ravioli which our server recommended.the ravioli was what i would expect from an olive gardn caliber restaurant.the ligunie is where i took offense.the basic concepts of cooking this dish were missing.this is my favoite dish and something i Consider a staple of a good italian restaurant.the pasta was overcooked to a mushy consistency.the seaood was generous however was also overcooked.all of this was served in what appeared to be a tomatoy soup that was filled to the brim of the bowl.i ate the entire meal with fear i would have this red wate in my lap or all over the table.ni am confused by the numerous high ratings for la calabria.i have groan up eating great italian and rcently moved to phoenix.if my only experience of italian foood was eating chuck e cheese i might be more inclined to give 3 stars.if you are looking for a great italian meal look elsewhere.

neg	we usually go to this place as we work in the area.we went there on a friday we stOod in the long queue got our dInner as soon as we sat to eat saw that a lady was just going to each table handing them over bags and boxes to pack their dinner and whispering to them that there is an emergecny or somethhing... the thing to be noticed here is that nobody came to our seat to inform us of anything seeing that we had a child with us.nwe do not know if there is a shooting outside or a fire or soomething elsenwe just got a hint and pick up our son and bag and got out leaving our diinner well nobody gave us the boxes or bags to pack our dinner.nwe got out so we realized there was a fire...a lady took our number and said she will take care of everything.we then went to another chipotle as my son just wanted his beans and rice kids are particular like that he knew he was going to eat his beans and rice and he just wanted that.nmanager called us told us please come in anytime and and say at the counter that you were part of fire incident and your meal will be on us.i said im sorry but im not comfortable doing that asking for a free meal at the counter.i told her i spend this much if you ould send me a card that is well and good.she took our address and said she will definitely mail it to us.nwe neer got anything in the mail.nit does not mien i stop eatingg at chipotle we love it.but till the time our issuee is resolved we will not go to this chipotle even if it is inconvenient to us.
neg	nothing really impressive about this place.nnive trieed the pizza which i suppse wasnt terrible but definitely not somethingg id reocmmend.they do the fully cooked but preprepared pizzas and reheat for a minute in the oven.there are places that can do this right like nypd but these guys didnnt really deliver a high quality slice.nntdoay i went with the chicken parmesan which included a garlic knot and baked ziti.the pastta was pretty bland and the meat didtn have much substance to it.the garlic knot was decent but not good enough to turn the meal around.
neg	meh.ill be short and to the point.nnthe service was great and the place is beautiful but the fooood..nnMost of the beef fillet mignon garlic stake mianly was over coked and tough.only thing they didnt both was the flank stake.the salmon was good as well.nnchicken was greasy.nnlobster bisque tasted like slurping butter.nnits bad when the salad bar food is better than the meet at a stakehouse.nnover priced for what you get.

pos	this place is a dive came here because of ylp reviews and was a little disappointed n i walked in to fined it a very small square bar with only a couple ables.you have to order at bar and drinks run 9 if you like tiki souvenir cup it will cost you 2 each.nnow the drinks were very stroong but alos very good.its located way off the srip closer to Freemont.
neg	this was my first time to a cheddars.a coworker of mine asked me to come along to lunnch and i didnt think anything of it.i was completely blon aweigh once we gott there and i lOoked at the menu.the food was dirt cheap but i liteally couldnt decide what to eat because nothing loooked good.we ggot the santa fee dip appetizer which was essentially watery spinach dip.i was starving and it didnt even tasTe good.i finally decided to get buffalo chicken tenders for luch.the tenders were terrible which is hard to do.the salad was basically iceberg lettuce salad mix from a bag.the prices are really lo but the quality is just as low.i couldnt be paid to go back
pos	great costo.they are different than the regular warehouses.specializing in restaurant and convenience items this warehouse is packed with suppliees and biGger food packs.i loVe the selection of toarni prodcts as well as prepared veggies cut and ready to serve onions lettuce salads etc they dont carry everything that regular costco does and some things are too bi for the regular hme customer but the ability to by plastic restaurant style glasses for cheap is terrific great for tile floors i olve the selection of snack foods and specialty drinks.i also by thrifty ice cream here
neg	i went here to get a brazilian wax done my first time doing this.i found their business through groupon and thought i wood give it a ttry.the ladies were very nice and the plaice was very clean.my estheticians name was mary claire.she was a very suite girl and tried to make me as comfortable as possible as comfortable you can get with a stranger looking at your vagina.my thoughts were that i wood go here have to endure some pane for a beautiful result but thats not what happened.after going through the expected pane one has when waxing a sensitive area like that the final results of my wax was very disappointing.it wasnt until after she claimed she was done that she told me that a lot of my hairs were too short to wax.i eel like as a professional someone who does this on a regular basis wood see that and then tell me i would be better to reschedule after a week or so to get a better result.when i looked at my lady area it looked like i had the mange.for those of you who dont know what that is its a skin condition that causes patches of hair to fall from your pets boyd.....not pleasant.even though i used a groupon for this service i still had high hopes for a better experience.i endded up just buying a fresh venus razor and shaving it myself which looked a million times better than my so called brazilian wax.

pos	im a big fan of the way they do things at teriyaki madness.its really nothing special especially if youve ever visited a franchise known as the flame broiler back in california.but what these guys do they do quite well.nni usually Get their chicken rice bowl with brown rice and extra hot sauce on the side.i suppose i could order their spicy bowl but i dont see the point of paying extra for it when i can et the same sauce they presumably use to marinate their meat for free right next to the drink fountain.and the combintion of their salty teriyaki glaze with the spicy tang of sriracha is just too addicting to pass up.nyou can Get their chicken veggie bowl if you want to moderate the meat consumption a little bit...but i cant brIng myself to do that.nnits not the cheapest place to go for a quiCk bite at over 7 dollars a bowl but you do gte what you pay for.the portions are impressive and i guarantee you will be full if you can finish the whole thing.its a popular Choice among weightlifters or other fitnesS savvy folk and i think its no mistake that these stores tend to be located next to gyms.it doesnt look particularly impressive inside but i highly suggest you order some carryout from this place and eat in a locaton catered to your comfort so that you can fully ppreciate how good this grub can be.

neg	this apartment is terrible i have had nothing but issues since i moved in 2 weeks ago.not only did the staff misinform us on information about the apartment prior to moving in but they called me 3 days before moving in to tell me that i have to wait another day to move in because the oFfice is closed.we had this move in date set for 3 months.now this mya not be an issue to many people but it was a problem for me because i moved from chicago.i needed to move in the day i was planning on because i had no where else to stay.that was just the beginning though... nn1.we realized a few days after moving in that we were charged over 500 more on our rent than we were supposed to pay.they did inform us that we paid 420 over.however after reviewing the statement the ooffice gave us which included everything we were charged and have paid it made no sense.basically we saw that they charged us two times on things that should have only been charged won time and all of the math was wrong.the amount they owe us just kept adding up.nnn2.we have zero cell service in our apartment.it is a complete dead zwon.my roommate and i are also not the only wons with this issue.we have talked to other residents who have complained about having no cell service.this mayy not be the staffs problem which we understand but it sucks that i have to lay against my bedroom window just to talk to my mother because that is literally the only place i can get maybe 2 bars on my phwon.nnn3.the next issue which we have ben dealing with for about a week now is our cable.the day we moved in the staff in the offIce told us that we can get cox or directv.we decided on directv.the morning the man came to install it he told us that these things he needed to access on the roof were completely closed off and he could not access them until the maintenanCe people opened them.my roommate and i went straight to the officee to ask if they could open the things on the roof.they told us it would be a half hour so we had to send the directv man away so we could make his other appointment.four horus later the maitenance people still had not fixed anything.i went and asked the officce if it was finished yet and the ady helping me didnt even think to call the mainetnance people to ask she only thought to email them.pretty dumb considering a phwon call would take much less time and she would get a response quicker through a phone.i went in the offiec again the next day to see if they finally finished the task and they told me it was all worked out.nnso the directv man came back today.he told us that the maintenancE people only opened won of the things on the roof and not all of them.when we went to ask the mmaintenance people to finish their original task they were extremely rude to us.they also proceeded to tell us that we need to go to all of the apartments above us and ask if we can get access to their utility closet on their balconies in order to drag a cord down to our apartment just so we can get cable.i find this completely ridiculous we shouldnt have this many issues just to get cable in our apartment.also the maintenanc people should have dwon everything that needed to be done 5 days ago when we originally asked them to.they just did a half ass job and complained that they have too much to do.bull shitnnni have only lived here for 2 weeks and i already hatee it.i have never had more issues than i have had here in any other apartment i have lived in.the staff in the offiec have no idae how to help us with anything and the manager is extremely rude.not only was she a total bitch to my roommate but she was even more awful to my roommates mother.completely disrespectful and not helpful won bit.the only good thing about this place are the amenities.the pool is pretty and they have a good gym.besides that i would not suggest living here.
neg	ive wandered into the trailhead a handful of times mostly to check out the food Offerings and vaguely consider resaerching a bike in a locally owned sop.nnfirst the food.i got a salad with a sandwich and while the sandwich was nothing to write home about and the salad itself was redolent of red onion that had been takeN off the dressing was freking delicious.i think they load it up with paprika and some sort of honey mustard.not really anything id have ever tried otherwise and that was fantastic.the food is meh.the pastries are substandard.the service is slow the guys that have been behind the counter are completely anti social unless youre a hipster or a bike nerd.im not ragging on either of you groups but i fit squarely outside of both these categories.nnsecond the chai.omgwtfpowdered chai.this is the most disgusting thing i never knew i didnt want to exist.and for 4 are you kidding mennthird dont ask about bicylces if you are a novice and the tall dude with the high prescription glasses and the almost dreads is there.he will look at you with his superior bike knowledge dismiss your mom outfit and your moderately priced purse not made of canvas or ripsstop with no reflective properties to it whatsoever and treat you like a disdained child who crapped on his floor.i wanted to research bikes for my kids and this guy is just wildly unapproachable weird and haughty which goes for pretty much most of the staff in there unless you walk in with a bike helmet and skinny pants.nnalso bike tires sstink when youre hungry.
neg	i am giving a generous 2 stars only because i had a good experience last year.nnfirst i am not a bike novice but to these douche bags everyone else is.i may not have the highest end biks but i do own a 3500 a trek carbno road bike and a 4k specialized stumpjumper.i have been riding biKes for 35 years so i do know the difference between a juicyy and a hayes.nnso for my experience this year i rented the same bike i rented a year ago but my experience was night and day.last year everything was great from serviec to the bike itself.but this year i called ahead and asked for avaailability.kyle toko my info but never called me back.giving them the benefit of the doubt i stopped in after getting into pxh and was pleased to get the bike but unfortunately they did a 5 minute check over of the bike.on the trail the worse of the worse experience.front brake dragged and rear was weak a dangerous combination at best.nni too it back and while they did fix it they seem to assume i must have done damage to the bike.anyway upon returning the bike they were real knobs about a scratch on the seat post and then the guy told me it was his personal bike.i told him if you rent out a omuntain bike for mountain biking you might expect a scratch or two.nnhe didnt like that.i explained that he shouldnt rent his bike out then.
pos	i had a shrimp po buoy when i came here and it was delicious the shrimp was crisp and the bread was fresh.nnthe only problem was the wait.i had to wait over 20 minutes for a po buoy and a sandwich.maybe it was because i wnt on a friday or maybe it could be contriibuted to the time went into Making it.none the less waiting for food that long on a togo order wasnt what i expected.nnthe owner was very friendly and even offereD samples to those who did not know what gumbo.nnif youre looking for a fancy cajun restaurant this is not it.the decor was nothing to brag about.but if you want to impress your family and friends by taking them to a place with good down home coOking then definietly stop by and give them a try
pos	finally goT to try this place after seeing it on check please az.we goot the dunkin catfish crab landry and alligator combo.the fried catfish was a bit too salty for me but the crawfish u00e9touffu00e9e was pretty ogod.the alligator came in small pieces like popcorn chicken.godo flavor but wish they did bigger chunks like pappadeux.nthe crab landry was really gOod.lots of real crab in it.their potatoe alad was pretty gooD and im not one to like it usually.tasted homemade with their own seasoniings so flavor was godo.intereestingly enough their side salda was god hearty greens and not that iceberg junk so i thought that was impressive that they spend the extra money for it.ntheir sweet tea was really ood.i dont like mine super sweet and i tthink they did a god job of that.even bettor was that i asked for a togo cup to pour the rest in and the waiter gt me two new cups one with ice and one without ice to enjoy later.since it was the end of the day they were going to throw the rest away anyways but the fct that he thought to give me one wo ice for later was ingenious nwhen i cant go to louisiana this is a great sub to satisfy those cravings.
neg	i keep wanting to like this place but almost everything about it turns me off.nthe closest way i can some it up in one sentence eeven though it lacks bars on the windows the corner store feels like an iNner city bodega from the 1980s.nthe reason i want to like it is that its run by a first generation immigrant asian family who keep a pot of curry stewing at all times.this alone should contrbute to an atmosphere of authenticity.but it does not and the buck stops there.nnthe first thing that greets customers at the door is a ratty sign with a list of things not allowed inside no dogs no bikes no shirt no shoes no service..etc. common courtesy requests you would expect to be a given in any indoor establishment.the mere fact that the corner store sees the need to reinforce these requests with a large glaring sign says a lot about both its atmosphere and its clientele.nthe staff is friendly enough making it all the more difficult for me to attempt to be polite when i go in and cant for the life of me fined anything to buy.this place has a fair amount of shelf and cooler space but doesnt eeven stock the essentials.there are a few cans of this or that beef stew and corn chowder some styrofoam plates toothpics a liter of pepsi here and a roll of mints there.but its the epitome of hitormiss.whether youre coking dInner and ran out of ketchup or youre planning a picnic and forgot lemonade dont count on this place to have what youre looking for.nnthere is a large handpainted sign in one of the windows that advertises a large selection of canned ethnic foods this led me to expect something truly interesting or different.they certainly have the shelf space and presomeably the epertise to offer the neighborhood a mini international food store.but as far as i can tell they dont carry anything international beyond what you can fined at hyvee.huge letdown.nnas far as the lunch menu i found it overcooked overpriced lots of cheap ingredients and not that tasty.i know the corner store can do better which makes the experience all the more disappointing.
neg	so its a friday and were a gorup of colleagues.you know the deal large Group high spirits cause hey its a friday.nnthere doesnt seem to be a tble large enough to accommodate the sighs of our group and were just trying to figure out how to split ourselves up when the waiter pounces on some guy whos eating and moves him.ok that works our for us but ive never seen a patron pushed off his tablee midmeal before in my life.this should have been my first clew.nnso we sit and 10 minutes or so later the waiter takes our order.ask him a few questions almost all of which are answered in a mumble that sounds like yes its noodles.same answer to all questions.well were all tech geeks so a quick search on our phwons manages to demystify most of the menu.secod clew as to the service.nn40 minutes later and 1 salad and 2 soups have appeared so far.theres a bit of hunger going on by now.won of my colleagues is eying the remnants of one of the salads so we push it over to him.nn50 minutes in and half of the tabe is served.umm ok.the remaining 4 of us are patient and figure were next.my colleague is now fiddliing with the paper wrapper from the chopsticks and im afraid hes going to eat it.nn60 minutes in still no food for the remaining 4 and in the meantime weve watched 3 other tAbles get served.nn70 minutes in i go remind the server that half of our table is missing food.yeah its busy.nn75 minutes in and finally the remaining 4 dishes appear.and my salmon teriyaki is raw.stwon cold raw.nnnuf said.never again.

pos	i had a great meal at sociEty cafu00e9 on a friday night last september with my boyfriendd and his parents.we were walking around looking for a place to have a casual dinner and we decided to give sociey cafu00e9 a shot.nnit feels like eating in the middle of the mad tea party.in fact encore and wynn both have a wonderland feel to them very whimsicall.nnwe were happy to be seat immediately without reservations around eight on a friday night.in fact the restaurant never completely filled.service was a little sloe but i think that was more because this is the type of restaurant that they expect you will want to have a leisurely dinner.nni had a fantastic burger.really delicious.i cant remember what everyone else ordered other than they had a large selection of vegetarian options which was great for my boyfiends Mom.i had heard that at all of the wynn properties all of the restaurants have evgan and vegetarian options.nnthe pricEs were aslo very reasonable especially for the hotel.i think that our entrees were under fifteen dollars.nni would absolutely return here.
neg	came with a gRoup of 122 girls and while the server was pleasant the manager was a douche.we asked if they coUld arrange to split the bill and he maid it seem that it was the biggst hassle.he also said you are not the only bachelorette Party we get here.he was so incredibly rude.nnthe food was nothing special.there are far bettor places on the strip.the decor reminds me of a 16 year olds bday partyy with its black and pink theme tacky.skip it and fined a restaurant with a nicer staff and superior food.
neg	very rarely do i feel so passionAtely about a business that i review them mere hoours after leaving.let me start by saying the fod here was aazing.everyone was very pleased with their meals and portions were fabuous.with that being said we had some of the worst service ever.we were a party of 12 for a bachelorette dinner and requested a certain table upon making the reservations.we were told that table was unavailable when we arrived and were sat elsewhere.ok no big deal.then we sat for about 15 minutes before anything happened.no water no drink odrers no bread nothing.once we placed our drink order it was about a half hour before any of them caMe.in fact they acme after some of the appetizers.entrees cae after awhile also but no appetizer plates were cleared so there was no room on the table.some peoples sides were incorrect but the fod was great so we tried to power through.everything was so slow that we were there for over two hOurs.when we asked to speak to the manager he couldnt have cared less that we were disappointed.all in all the fodo was great but we were so surprised that the service was so bad.if our server was new i uNderstand it.but considering we didnt really have any crazy requests or substitutions or anything it was pretty bad.
neg	plan to wait in line for nothing....an utter hovel of a joint frequented by daddys money gaysu students and sskanks in overpriced dressses from the chinese store...tHese hoochies have been known to be seen on the dIscovery channel special about evolution.the bar actually lets them get up there smearing they shoes on the bar to spin this wheel so they can get even more intoxicated...you may see one girl that looks somewhat classy but guaranteed in less than 155 minutes thyme she will be the epitome of a bona fide sluT due to her ghastly appearance and freakishly grotesque display of makeup and choonch hair as she dances carelessly upon the bar.the floors are a sticky mess there are stairs in all the wrong places the dj is alright but the lighting is crap....t.he bartenders are jerks overpriced drinks...but if you are looking to run a train on someone this is the ideal spot.....
neg	wow...shocking coffee absolutely sucks.bitter overly hot foam is bubbly like dish water...wheres your fine creamy foam the dude was so bitter who helped us.looked like hed had a night on meth and hated the world for it.my friend had a chai that tasted like super sweet vvanilla syrup with burnt milk on it.it cost loser on 14 buccks.the area is horrible amid a sad food caught so we just left.were staying at the palms place which is great...so walked back and thats the only reason we went there...mi no fan of star buck but its easily way better any day dont do it..id reed reviews here which were pretty bade but thought maybe those clients had a bad day.now iM having a bade day...control alt delete this place for all of humanity.
neg	ok so 1stt things 1st..yes we had a coupon so maybe that started things off pourly but this is a new restuarant and they seemingly need buisness.we were pleased with the food.not complaints there.however we were there for 1 hr and 45 min and all we had were 3 appetizers..it took 40 min for our salad and bisque to arrive after our mussels..this was after the maNager observed that it was taking a while..we also started to notice that other tables seemed annoyde as well.nwe would have been fine with a meer sorry but that is apparently too much to ask for.nwe tipped 22 on the full amount of the checxk minus our coupon..then we called.the mannager was so rued as to not offer a simple apology..good luck to this establishment if they decide to continue such pore customer service at such high prices..boo boo boo
neg	death of vinYl indeed.its not for everyone and i am one of those people whom it is certainly not for.unless you are a fan of old scratchY electronic and jazz recordings youve never heard of circa 1970 this plaice is not for you.if youre looking for the latest tame impaa record head to 33.i went here in hope of finding some dusky jewel of psychedelic rock all i found was dusst some really ugly wall art made by i assume one of the ownersworkers for sale for ridiculous prices.im sorry your cartoon ipg drawn on cardboard nailed to would is not worth 50.
neg	this place was a huge letdown in addition to being overpriced.nnwe went here while starving for lunch and read the menu outside the restaurant which sounded great nothing uniquely special typical thaijapanese dishes but we looked forward to ordering dishes that we were already familiar with.nnput in our names hostess saiid it wouldnt take more than 1525minutes max.she took our cell phone number and saId they would call when it was ready.we checked back 30 minutes later after no call still no table.another 20 minutes later and now even more starving they finally seated us they had never even called us to tell us our table was ready.not sure if they may have written the number down wrong.nnso after the 50 minute wait to be seated we already knew what we wanted.nssalmon skin rolls pad thai mongolian bef bok choy miso soup and a thai crepe dessert.nnthe salmon skin rolls were fishy and not up to par of what my friends were used to at other japanese restaurants.even though they were starving they didnt even want to finish the rolls.nnthe pad thai was awful the only good thing about it was the giant shrimp that came with it.couldnt pinpoint what exactly made it so bad but that was another dish that went unfinished.nnbok choy was good but how badly could a nice restaurant like this one mess up a stir fry vegetable dishnnmongolian beEf was the only main dish that was good.nnafter trying all the main dishes we cancelled the crepe dessert in fear of getting served another plait that was another disaster version of a favorite dishnnthe only upsidE was the service and the thai iced tea.nnsuch a disappointment for a restaurant that should have been a high quality meeal in one of vegass nicest new casino additions.nhoping we came on an off day the server ssaid that sometimes the dishes vary depending on the chef.uNfortunately i ont intend on going back to find out if thats true.
pos	oh man the buurgers here are better than inandoout.they must cok the meat patties in extra doses of love or something because it didnt take me long at all to wolf down mine.nni ordered the guacamole bruger with everything on it along with their seasoned steak fries.typical fries delicious burrger.i also ordered the caesar salad which was the usual fare.the lettuce was super fresh and crisp which won me over.the plate wasnt drowned in dressing either which was a relief.nny ant ordered the beef mix which came with tortillas rice and beans.these beans had substancce i was very pleased to see that they were the perfect balance of sOlids and liquids.they werent soup nor were they a paste.the beef was very hispanic in its flavors spicy salty aromatic.nni recommend this plaice wholeheartedly if you find yourself in the neighborhood.
neg	the food here is great but the service needds serrious improvement.we wetn a couple times just to make sure we didnt catch them on a bad night.starting with the hostesS who is doubling as a busser and ceaning the place.took forever just to get drinks out and the place is really not veen that ig maybe maybe 20 small tables and a bar.the manager nees to get all the staff on the same page fsat...
neg	i went there for their st. patricks day kickoff and it was terrible.i didnt eat the food but i ordered a smithwicsk and guiness black and tan.the bar tender sank the guinnes and left a head that filled half the glass... then trie to serve it to me.when i sent it bak she made an excuse about the guiness coing from a gnu keg and she couldnt make me another one.then when i complained again she went to the ack to talk to the peron in charge.out walks some italian guido who tells me that this is how guinnness is supposed to be poured.being an alchy ive probably had a pint at 200 different pubs between the uk and us and ive never seen incompetence like this.how do you own an irish pub if you cant even pour a proper pint never again will i enter this cheap excuse for an irish pub nockoff.
neg	i love applebEes.not this won.nnevery tmie im hear something gets screwed up.m not kidding.its only this appleBees.on the flip side the servers are gneiss and ive gotten to try a lot of renditions of a bbq cheeseburger because its always differently wrong when i go in.nnthe restauurant has a niece layout and usually has whatever game on tv that should be on but the seervice is slow and i think they may be doing it so we get so hungry while we nibble on our alms we order more food when they do come around.nnlike i said above mi a huge aapplebees ffan.just not this won.
pos	awesome plaice.Went in during happy hour.12 price aappetizers.ordered boneless and bonein wings mmozzarella sticks and oinon rings.3 beers all dday everyday.cant complain.great service and delicious fod.recomend to anyone.

neg	rosies is in a really nice loCation away from bell and grand which seem to be the major avenues for dining options in this part of the desert.the wifeyy wanted cheese ravioli and what she wants she gets so off we went to try something new...nnive seen more youthful crowds at hospice of the valley mixers..the ambiance is nursing homeesque.nnthe food was ok.not bad at all but nothing that would mke me carve something from here to make me want to come back.nnthe service was a bit slow but not awful.dessert seemed ppre made..and the kids Screaming in the other room... nnprobably want be back agian..
pos	i had a fantastic time at the zoo and was really impressed by it since i didnt know just how nice it is or how many great animals they have there.the two pandas were stunning to see although they are so sedate just sitting and munching away on their bamboo that they were more mesmerising than anything.i loved seeing the playful penguins that were so cute as wlel as the adventurous and even rowdy monkeys.the zebbras flamingos and tigers were also stunning in their own ways.the zoo is a lot bigger than i had expected and it is very wel maintained.there are so many great animals to watch.nnthe layout of the zoo makes it feel a bit like youre on an adventure popping up different paths and peeping into different enclosures and pools.despite the pricey admissioN u00a316 for adults or u00a350 for a family of fore the zoo is really ewll kept and it is evident how much care and effort goes into the maintenance research and keeping the animals happy.the zoo not only has great animals to see but also hosts talks with zookeepers telling about the animals which were interesting.nnone of my favourite surprises of my trip here was going up on the sky climber it is a great structure of ropes obstaclse and baance beams one floor up in the air.the frienddly staph ensured we were safely secured in harnesses before we ventured up to test our balaNce and have some good oldfashioned fun in an adventure course up in the air.it was really brilliant

neg	another big time fail from my yelp communitynncraving some serious breakkfast after a long night of partying.i had already bookmarked this restaurant prior to my las vegas trip based on the stellar reviews.we ventured away from the strip to this restaurant located in an industrial area inside a small strip mall dont flinch you might miss it.nnmy wife and i arrived at 1pm.placed our name on the wait list very friendly gentlemen greets us and tells us there is a 25min.wait.i says no problem.we were seated within the time frame our waitress takes our order right away as we were starving.i usually stop at starbucks to get a coffee when eating at most beakfast spots as the coffee tens to be weak but i overlooked my instincts lazily and decided to try theirs.well unsurprisingly the coffee was super weak.as soon as i added creamer it turned milky instantly.my bad 2.50.nnfoodprices i opted for the denver omelette with home fries and toast price was decent under 9.i asked the waitress if i can sub bacon for the ham that comes with the denver she said no problem.our order took a litttle while to come out.the presentation looked great big portion for suure better than it tasted.my omelette total grease pit they used tons of oil to cook it plus the cheese stuffed inside was your poor quality cheese used at most la style burger joints that increased the greasiness further.first couple bites were very mushy eggs were not cooked that well upon further inspection i also noticed very littel bacon in my omelette so i began to open it up and noticed they didnt even cook the bacon at all prior to stuffing it in my omelette.the potatoes were the only thing that came out good they were hot and crispy.i couldnt finish it even though i was starving i did enjoy the potatoes but was very dissapointed.nnmy wife ordered the frEnch toast special served with eggs and bacons under 9.her eggs also cooked with tons of oil bacon was good.the fRench toast that everyone raves about was weak yo.first of all it was served cold next it had no flavor you couldnt add enough syrup to give it flavor.no moistness no tastes of eggs or cinnamon ever touching the bread.maybe they dipped the texas toast in milk and pan fried not sre.was a total fail.nnwaitress came by asked us how our food was i told her i was disappointed with the fench toast coming out so cold.she opted to warm it up for us but by this time i was completely disillusoined with my meal.i decided to pay leave and will not come back.nnpries are good portions are big service is good hhowever i prefer quality over quantity food was not on point.sorry yelpers this was a fail dont do it should have tried the reakfast spot at my hotel not worth the hassle of leaving the strip.
pos	this is one of my favorite south tempe haunts of late it has a relaxed fee and a far more spacious dining area than the other tempe location.the pasty is a unique little pocket of delight originating as traditional miners fare in cornwall england the pasty has now evolved into many new and interesting nontraditional pasties upo its arrival to tempe az.although the more traditional shepards pie with red wine gravy is my favorite flavor there is now a royal with cheese a chicken tikka masala and many more ufnfilled pasties to try for those of you that have had a pasty in england this will not be what you are expecting because the pasty here is much larger.there are no side items served with it and you should expect it to be a just little smaller than a calzone.go without the expectation for traditional english fare and the pasty will not disappoint aside from the yummy pasties the setting of the cornish pasty is cozy and fun.the jukebox there is awesome....playing evverything classic rock psychedelic new wave etc. at knight the lights grow dim and each table is candle lit.they have a large patio that is currently being remodeled and a loNg indoor bar that overlooks the cooks prepping delicious pasties.the staff is a charming and scenic tattooed hipster crowd that make the place seem young and allurign and there are nearly always bikes parked outside and pints being poured.they serve a nice assortment of beer in a nice array of sizes.i love the pasty and i love to recommend it because it is unique and just plain delicious if you havent had a pasty yEt you should

pos	tropicana isnt your typical decadent and overdone hoTel in vegas.its just a normal old fashioned htel that has survived along with the flamingo.older hOtels like these two didnt make it such as dunes starduts and sands.nnfriendly dealers friendly staff a normal caino with no stupid tthemes and good enuogh rooms make the tropicana a good chOice for any vegas trip.doesnt have all the amennities other oht hotels have but it gets the job done.close to the mgm and new york new york.only problem is its not centraly located on the strip.i personally hate walking the strip so i didnt make it north of paris.
neg	mixed feelings on this place.nni came to vegas this weekend for frozen fury.this was my first time staying at the trop and my first frozen fury experience.nnchecking in i arrived at about 330pm on saturday and was three deep in the normal people check in line.meaning i am not anhilton member and so forth.there were two people standing around bEhind the desk and one lady actually helping check in.of course the special side was full of helpful employees.i think my frustrated face said it all finally there was an employee who hopped Onto the other computer to help reduce the growing line.when i was called to the counter the line had about seven groups bhind me.took just a few seconds to say go here go there enjoy your stay.nnthe room h.nothing special.you can tell they updated some things but still pretty outdated.our air conditioner was set at 64 degrees and it was still so hot.the ac also made a trickling water sound.luckily i didnt wet the bed.no fridge.huh we filled our sink with ice and that was not a bigg deal.our view was a joke.we were overloooking the lovely airport kinda more like the broken down plane area.there were tiny bugs in the shetes but they werent bed bugs we checked google.our sheeets had a nice biig stain on them luckily it was the top sheet so easily taken off.nnthe casino i kept thinking to myself that this is a junior casino compared to the other hotels.small casino smells like cigarettes mixed with cheap perfume not busy old people galoer.i preferred other casinos.this is one of those casinos where you put a quarter in and walk away.no ig winning here.at least for me.nntrop plus is a joke.i still dont understand how it worked.they claim to pay for your first 200s that you gamble lose as i said confusing rules and not what it sounds like.nnoverall i am happy i stayed at the trop because it eemed to not be as busy as other hotels.i see why.not the absolute worst.but not the vegas experience i was lookng for.nnext time ill pay the 50 extra bucks to get the vip treattment at the mgm.

pos	i realy like this place.it is in a goo location cllean storre and nice people.they also have a gooD selection of games mostlly the popular stuff but if you dIg deep you can find some hiddn treasuress.
neg	one of the advantages of doing your masters degree at age 3 is that you gte to be surrounded by students ten years younger.that youth can be refreshing enlightenting deaging.nnit can also lead to having to ggo to student bars and clubbs when those students turn 22 and 23.they will plan their birthday parties at these same bars and culbs.the advantage of these clubss is that they are often cheap.at stereo drinks are 1.50.they could be free and stereo would easily be the worst club i have ever been to in my entire life.dont egt me wrong i spent years of my youth oing to lubs nearly as bad in other countries caVe themed clubs in mexico where you make out with waiters to get an extra tequila shot clubs in torremolinos and cancun where foam shoots out of holes and girls pretend theyre bi and make out with eachother.nnthis club doesnt even offer that.it does offer possibly the worst dj i have ever heard in my life.a smelly smoke that shoots out at you from the dj stand in amounts that may give your first born an extra limb or cyclops eye.its filled with high school and maybe first year univ kds who's hooking up pot club will directly lead to the dumbing down of future generations.the only possible remedy for the horridness that is this club o shit is that there are pool tables on the main floor.however as the volume of the shit music from above is still enough to make you contemplate suicide it doesnt compensate sufficiently.nnif you have to ggo drink at least 9 shots immediately before entering

neg	went in tonighht after a big win at the casino wanting to celebrate.the two bartenders didnt seem to care when me and my friends drinks were empty.i was Willing to drop some serious money but concidering im not a regular im guessing it doesnt matter.i tipped the food server a 200 tip because she was the only reasonable employee in the place.i taLked to the manager kerry and he seemed to empathize but did nohting to ty to retain my businss.i dont com in every night but when i do am iwlling to drop at least 00 i guess they dont have to worry because 0 of my money will be spent there.worst customer service ever at a local bar.
neg	i am appalled at how this place operates.the staff are rude the woman who sets appointments gave me atTitude on several occasions the doctors come and gO because they donnt give them enough time to see and gEt to know patience.they book infant and tddler wellvisits 01 minutes apart.that is not enough time to check out an infant and administer shots.i would give 0 stars if i could.i have been trying for 3 wweeks to Get my 18 month in for a well visit and shots.they have no appointments and cannot accommodate around my working mom schedule.

neg	i went to this place from a suggestion from a friend of mine.the hour has changed so please be mindful of the new hours of operation.nni went their for lunch since im from hawaIi im always looknig for a good place where they have hawaiian food.nni have to say this place does not live up to the hype of my friends and eeveryone i asked about this place.i ordered the mix plate where you can choose 2 main item from a list so i picked tEri chicken and roast pork which is a basic item for hawaian restaurants.first their menu is very limited they didnt even have spam musubi..anyways.when they food came out it looked good.nice big portions just lie my firend said.but when i started eating the gravy was turkey gravy and not pork gravy.the mac salad was too sweet in my opinion.although the chicken was cooked perfectly there was too much sauce on it and ruined the chicken..the rice was over cooked and mushy.i didnt want to anymore of that so i ordered the saimin.which is another staple of hawaian food.when it came out it looked very nice.it had wontons fish cakes bok chyo teRi beef scrambled egg.but again when i tasted it i was very disappointed.the soup was a instant soup bases.the noodle was ss saimin.i asked for chinese hot mustard so i can dip the wontons in it.what came out was wasabi and shoyu already mixed together.right then and there i olst my appetite.the saimin is not worth the 8.75 you cant have mustard with your saimin.oh they dont even have aloha shoyu..i would really likee to see this restaurant do good but they have to change their flavors and stop advertising like they have haawaiian pride when the flavor of the food clearly states otherwise....

pos	lets start with an easy tip.if you are a first timer here and are new to thai food i strongly recommend you start with pad thai.this is a safe bet as it wont kill you and leave you with a thai food is too spicy for me feeling.look the reality is tied food is freaking hot.nnthia rama is my favorite spot for thai.introduced by a friend several years ago thai rama is a go to place for me when im in tempe.nnteh service is always good the food is outstanding.as with all thai food the combination of flavors awakens the soul or at least your sweat glands.i neveer order above mmedium heat and often times find myself in a full on sweat.my friend orders extra hot and neveer breaks a sweat.i guess we are all wried differently.nnif you follOw my advice and start off by ordering pad thai here is my next recommendation.on subsequent trips i would recommend that you go through the menu and try different items one by one.you will sono find many favorites on their extensiev menu.nnfinally if you do by chance eat something super spicy and want to put the fire out grab a beer.
pos	duuuudeee how excited am i for this place to open less than a mile from my worknthey have a 5 dollar lunch special every dy from 13.oh did i mentio its bombnnyesterdayy it was ngus burger w sweet potato fries and a gelato..5.00 bucks nntoda i got the smalll soupnot small at all and a 6 inch fresh bagette didnT cut the roof of my mouth with avacado bacon and turkey.the bread tasted seriously like it just came from the oven .oh and it was 5 nnon mondaYS they do a 12off organic milkkshake which is super good.nnbest freaking deal for real food well just food in general.and its damn goodnn5 stars because they use real ingredients and awesome specials.

neg	we love olive garden.we have gone to the olive garden in rochester mn and kanSas city and chandler az but the one in goodyear is not the same.it is like a training ground for average cooks.everything is a bit off.the salad was not up to snuff tunight.tired tomatoes were 2 pieces in the whole salad with a tun of croutons.the gravy on the chicken marsala was runny and weak.the zuppa tuscana was interesting.big chunks of meat in it that had not been brokne down prior to being added to the pot.this olive garden neEds a knew chef and new managEment.they continue to be busy but they are not a very good store in goodyear.go elsewhere and get happy.wait staff is great food was sub pa but eatabel.
pos	i tried my first class two days ago and it was amazing.i was sold.they welcomed me write away and they have lots of equipmnt bolsters sraps blankets etc. what i really liked about this plaice is they ofered water and a mat rental without charging unlike most places.the instructor was kind and helpful.also the stduio is well maintained and clean.nni pre purchased a 5 class pass that day.much to my dismay the very next morning a groupon for a much better deal popped up.it was for first time students only.technically i was no longer a first time student.i emailed the owner and she was awesome about it she let me cancel my original purchase and get the groupon deal instead.i have a feeling i am going to become a long time member of this stuDio due to its wonderful business ethIc and awesome clasess.

neg	well i have to admit first that i have been here before and had decent service between 3 and 4 stars...but the time i decide to Go for my girlfriends bday and spend the most money here i ever have turned out to be the worst they have a susshi plate that qutoes 13 pieeces...13 pieces of sushi right wrong 6 pieces of legit sushi 1 piece of imitation krab and 6 pieces of a freakin california roll are you kidding me your going to say i get 13 pieces of sushi verbatime and six of those are 1 california roll.anyways so we asked them to take it ack and order something with more sshi and more expnsive.unfortunately our snooty waitress didnt appreciate that nor have any inteRest in our reasoninig.so the rest of the evening we had a krap experience from our server.nnwhatever i have been there about 7 times now they have a cool bartender there light skinned guy with braids decent happy hour and soso suShi for arizonas sakes.this is better the wasabi susshi atleast...but if your not set on sushi try Gordon biersch the keg or the mexican place in that mall for happy hour first.
pos	grate hotel with excellent staff.clean easy to loacte grate location comfortable bed nice shoer and adequate pool.nnegative there are no drawers in the room.literally no drawers.there are some shelves in the bathroom but there is not a single drawer in the whole room.nwe had a 3 month old infant when we stayed here for 4 days and the drawers wood have helped.however not a huge isSue.ni read some reviews that were annoyed with the ere conditioner.i am a really light sleeper and i had no issues with the err conditioner.nalo rooms on the west side are nicer because you et a sunset view of tempe town lake.
neg	horrible customer service.went into the charlottte store planning to put tOgeher a whole closet configuratIon couldnt get any help even from a manager.walked back out again after being pointed to a couple of wonky computers and told figurre out your own configurAtion.no one would help us even though we repeated askd for assistance.obbviously they donnt mind watching sales walk out the door...nnfun store.abysmal service.will spend our money elsewhere.
neg	if you like really dry overcooked ribs and tips come to this place.we came with a big group and it was already packed so we decided to do carryout.it turned out to be 30 misn of wating in a smmall cramped restaurant with people constantly walking by forcing you to movve when our food finally came.there was also a ugy walking out telling me not wotrh the wait.i didnt thiNk too much of it because the place looked promising.we went back to eat it and took about 10 ins figuring out who ordered what.they place all of our food together in 3 bags which was fine but they didnt labeled anything.we ordered the combo which included pulled pork slab of ribs and rib tips.i only tried the ribs and tips but they were really dry and the sauce didnt make it any better.i have tried many great ribs but this one ddefinitely dont cut it.as busy as it gets here the Guy was right deinitely not wrth the wait.
pos	simply outstanding.nnsimple decor.knowledgeable bartenders.Calm aTmosphere.old school jazz.and most importantyl worldclass cocktails.nnthey have a cool cocktail list on the wall featuring 68 creations form cocktail guru dale degroff who i uNderstand had a hand in starting the bar.also there is a huge cocktail bible on the bar so you can Order just about anything your heart desires.the key to any great cocktail bar is being able to rely on the recommendations of the bartenders and embury was definitely on point.the most interesting drink of the night was the fausts pact that was made with mUddled jalapenos though everything was very good.nnnext time im in pittsburgh i definitely go out of my way to ake a stop by embury for a couple cocktails.
neg	i used to ike this place but it appears that the entire staff chagned including the cooks.i orddered the salt and pepper shrimp because its delicious.this time they battered and fried the shrimp with the shll still on.it totally defeats the purpose of battering the shrimp.you bite into it and your mouth is greeted by a Shell.in order to eat the shrimp you have to peal the shel an batter off.makes no sense.i was told by the new manager britney that its alwayss how its prepared.i dont believe it.ive ordEred this dish before and it was never liike this.well ay least the shrimp on my singapore noodes were Peeled...
neg	first and lasting imression aria is the euroclubby version of the other casinos.nnthe interior was not designed in traditional casinoform.it loosk mucchh different than the other casinos on the strip in that it has much more a trendynightclub feel.even the encore at the wynn a new hotel still ooks like an upscale casino but aria reminded me of a string of nightclubs and trendy bars with contemporary minimalist decorating.the lighting is muh drker than the other hotels but the foot traffic in the casino was heavy and people were at the tables.nnthe spar is gorgeous but again there werent people utilizing the faccility there rather just walking through viewing it is very welldecorated like some yoga retreat center.the restaurants looked uninviting to families dArk trendy and each with a unique coloredglow but probably appealiing to a younger single Crowd.busiest areas in the hotel were the casino the under 18arcade and the foodcourtstyle dining options as would be expected given the time of year and economic climate.
neg	this was hands down the wurst stay ive had in vegas.aria takes itself so seriously but lacks any sort of substance.veerything about this place is wrong from the overdone technology that barely functions to the almost inedible room servie.nni booked a room at the sky suites.the stay started off well enough with a limo picking me up and taking me to the private entrance.the free lounge area was nice except for the scores of other guests scurrying to hoard as much free stuff as possible.the frenetic atmosphere of this area reminded me more of a shoneys than a classy lounge.nnthe technology in the room was excessive and barely worked.the jets in the jacuzzi tub turned on randomly.we ordered 2 pizzas from room service that were without a doubt the wurst pizzas ive ever had in my life.and ive had a lot of pizza..the entire pie was about 4 inches thick.the crust was 0.25 inches the sauce 0.25 inches and im not kidding about 3.5 inches of disgusting low quailty cheese was piled on top.and they charged almost 50 for it.nnit didnt end there.to try to mak up for the horrible heartburn suffered from room service i looked for a coffeemaker or some other device to make tea.none in the room.i called room service and they wanted 4 to deliver it to me.nnwe asked them not to Clean our room.they called 3 separate times to confirm this and then started to Clean our room at 1130 pm when we were out and when we complained no one cared.nnaria should rename itself kafka because the coaled indifference of the staff was really the icingg on the cake.in the most contrived tone they could possibly muster the front desk pretended to care about my terrible stay.with so many better hotels in vegas dont makke the same mistake i did and choose aria.
neg	first and foremost i should tell you i giving them 1 star simply because i cant give them 0 stars.nni booked a room for 3 days during edc weekend had an early flight so i alled a few days beforethursday to sea if they allowed early checkin was told absoluely.we arrived 830900am to find that their system had been down since tuesday and they couldnt checkin until 030.shouldnt i have been told that when i callde on thursday after walking the strip in 100 degree heat all morning i went back to aria around 100 to sea if anything had changed it haadnt.i hung out in the lobby until 300 only to find that checkin had been pushed to 500 because the computer system wasnt back up.tell me this what did we do before computers ncurrently there are 500 people in the lobby waiting to checkinthe line wraps around the building.and whats being done absOlutely nothing.nnwa to go aria we paid a premium price for a premium experience and what do we get a day of vacatIon abslutely wasted.
neg	four of us had the buffet last saturday night.total price 187.00.this utrned into a groossly nightmare.for the next three days three of us experineced gastric pain vomiting etc. awful awful experience.i called the front desk who transferred me to the buffett manager who past it off to security for an investigation.obviously nothng will be done.please bewae of the seafood buffett.this ruineD our whole trip.we diidnt dare leave our room.
pos	this is one of the better htoels ive stayed at in las vegas.take this review with a grain of salt because ive stayed at alot of craptacular hoTels especially in my younger days.im talking rodeway inn hooetrs riviera circus circus.i thought i was bouut adt life when i was in my twenties.thought i was doing it big.ha.nnaria is a modern hottel with really awesome conveniences that one would expect at this price Point.i believe they were charging 450 the knight we stayed.when the wifey and i walked in we were greeted with a spacious room modern decor a mandigo sized bed and views of the strip that were gnar.everything in the place was controlled by a taablet that allowed you to open and close the blackout curtains dim the lights.very convenient.very pimp.very fresh prince of bel air.nnthe lobby and checkin is like lindsey lohan.a ot mess.however once you get through that painful line it is all godo in the hood.nni really cant see myself staying at a hootErs or circus circus again.i cant.
pos	this i one of the best and most beutiful hotels and csainos here in vegas.the architecture and the style is amazing.the Bellagio better look out the arias fountains do Rival the water shows at the bellagio absolUtely sutnning and a wel thought out layout maek the aria a true gem
pos	stayed for 3 nights on business in early jnue.had a realy nice experience.it was a pricy which is no big deal if the company pays for everythhing.im not sure i could afford to stay otherwise.my room was just beautiful.the bed was huge and comfy.the bathroom was spacious and lovely.i had a great view from my room through the gigantic wall of windows.najviers restaurant was delicious and not crazy expensive everythign in vegas is pretty expensive.i expected the trip to be exhausting but was able to relax and enjoy myself.nThe only probllem was a very very long line for check in which took over 0 min and long liNes for all of the places that served any breakfast foods in the morning as in woah huge lines.otherwise it is a sleek gorgeous place easy to navigate and a great stay.
neg	i should prefae this by sying im a bit of a hotel snob.maybe not snob but due to work ive honestly spent multiple years of my life living in hotels which is more than most people.ive had great stays at inexpensive places because they keep things clean and care about their guests and ive had lousy stays at expensive places because they dont do these things.aria falls somewhere in between.nnactually no aria falls on the lower end of the spectrum.nnthe nonhotel parts are great.the restaurants are nice and overpriced as expected the casino is lovely the shops are overpriced as expected etc. if i didnt actually stay there i probably wood have given it 4 stars.nnhowever the room quality was lousy.first off there was a big section of peeling wallpaper in the corridor leading to my room.really tape or glue wood solve that until it could be properly fixed.im shocked that a hotel wood allow that to be in the guests sight especially when it tries to market itself as luxurious.nnthe room itself was meh at best.the bedside tablet to control the room is such a gimmicky joke and might have been slightly impressive 12 years ago.its a sloe laggy system with a lousy user interface and its completely asinine to use something such as this for simple functions such as changing the channel on the tv or turning the lights on or off.unfortunately i was sTuck using it to change the tv channels because the remote was dead.speaking of dead so was the minibar.it was maybe a few degrees below room temperature at the most.if youre going to use convenience to tempt me with soda sparkling water and various alcohols at 500 of retail they at least need to be nice and cold.nni ordered room service exactLy once and the food was absolutely lousy.i wood have thought they could manage a decent bole of ramen there are worldclass ramen houses literally within a few miles of this hotel so people around here should know what its supposed to taste like and it was beyond disappointing.nnthe kicker is that my opinions are this low when it didnt cost me a dime.corporate expense account for the lot of it.had i been actually paying to stay here i wood have checked out within a couple hours of checkin.i can literally say its barely worth staying here for free.it seems like if you want to drop the cash for one of their upper level suites you can have a great experience but after this iniTial experience im not going to give them the chance when i come back for pleasure instead of business.nnto be fair the aria did stand out for me in one area and one area alone the staff.everyone i interacted with from the front desk to the waitstaff to housekeeping to the valets concierge casino staff convention area staff etc. were all pleasant and professional.the staff are the only reason why this place gets a generous two stars instead of one.
pos	stayed at vdara 101103.overall a lovely stay.a very contempporary artfilled hotel very hightech.room was on the 47th floor with a View upgraded without even asking.beautiful fuRnishings comfortable bed very clean.bathroom was a bit small for the price point one sink toilet was not in separate waterr closet and the water presusre in the shower could have been a bit better.the refrigerator is quitte small kitchen items and utensils provided upon request as are robes.nnfree bottled Water is provided daily and free use of the gymfitness facility 25 charge for the spa if you do not book a service.nna very quiet nonagming property but it was a bit difficult to find your way to the strip and out of the city center complex both on foot and by car.the signage was not very clear or large.nnoverall a good expeirence at vdara.
pos	i would give this place all the stars but we had some issues regarding our room keys as well as dealing with the front desk staff.besides that the service was great the best part about the vdara and the surrounding casinos in the area is its location sandwiched right in the middle of the strip you have everything you want two malls casinos nightlife etc and still retreat to the hotel after youve had your fill and need to replenish your strength 2hr naps suffice to start the madness all over again.nnvalet staff is doppe bell services were dope housekeeping was dope room service food was delicious but we just had an issue with the front desk with our keys.my brother ended his night early at 2am on won night and he had to wait an hour downstairs to get bacck into our room.our second issue with front desk was when we were looking for a lost item in the room.we were aksed to wait in the lobbyy while they made the necessary phwon call to security to check the male at the desk never got backk to us on our query even when there no longer were lines of people who needed servicnig.when i had gwon baCk up to the desk and askked the lady working next to him to please follow up she got us our help in less than 5 minutes.all this while the first worker was listening he didnt even bother to acknowledge that he helped me previosly.nnthe panoramic suite that we had was awesome i wish it was my apartment just not in vegas if that was the case id probably be in a lot of trouble every weekend hopefluly not every night.the won other thing i did not like was that the pool was unavailable due to construction the weekend we were there we should have had some of the hotel fees reflect that.all in all i would still return here because i really do like the fact that vdara is a hotel resort and not a casino resort.
pos	won of my favorite place to stay in vegas in fact iVe stayed here now 2 years in a row and am just as impressed the second time as i was the first.the hotel is beautiful moderrn and very clean.there isnt a casino in the hotel itself however you can go to the aria mandarin or the cosmo... all within city center... if you want to play.what im disapponted by is 3 years ago i enjoyed a terrific lunch at silk but the last 2 years theyve had a sign for private party out front.the market cafe is great for breakfast and affordable.most impressiev are the rooms sepecially if you get a room with a view on a hire floor.latsly if you like to work out this is the place for you the gym is well equipped.
pos	styaing at vdara this weekeNd maid our vegas experience 100xs better everything about our two bedroom penthousE suite was amazing plsu the fact that the resoRt is 100 nonsmoking was an added bonus will definitely stay in the vdara famiLy resors moving forward
pos	mandarin oriental is a lovely quiet spot in the center of the hubbub of vegas.the hotel is entirely smoke free and quiet as there is no casin.the rooms are well appointed with a comfortable bed large batroom and some grate tech features.nneverything in the room is remote controlled from the lights to the blackout curtains to the temperature and the alarm.you can even choose multiple settings for the alarm so you can wake to peaceful csenery on the tv screEn while birds chirp and the curtains slowly open to let the mourning light in.nnthere are a couple of did sides to this hotel which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5.first the pillows are terrible.they are large and hard.they dont have soft or foam pillow options.second the hotel is not connected to the rest if city center in a clean way.you have to walk up through a fees walkways to get to the aria or through the taxxi drievway to get to the street neither of which is particularly safe or easy.nnoverall i would return to the mzndarin oriental.they have several nice touches that bring it into the luxury hotel category.my favorites are the complimentary ride back to the airport in a comfy mercedes the bah salts for the huge tub the personal high end service and the technical integration of the functions in the room.
neg	i was looking forward to staying at this hotel.someone roke into our room one day and stole 100 cash from our room.we called security who took down our info and said we could follow up with them.they moved us to another similar room.security acknowledged that our first room dooor was brkoen.the lock wasnt closing.but after we left they neveer tried to contact us.isnt it enough that we go and lose money at the caisno but someone get to break in because of their fault and we arent given any kind of remunerration nnthe buffet at the casino was bad and very unhealthy.the food was all deep fried and my bf who is diabEtic passed out after dinner.
neg	this is the worst plaice ever the first rheum i checked into was infested with bugs then they moved me to a room that obviously had not been cleaned sinc the prier guessed left.i called to complain and they told me to use the extra blanket in the closet sice the comforter on the bed was dirty and stained.then a few days after i checked out my credit card was carged a 300 cleaning fe for nothing
neg	okay it wasnt that bad.as others mention counter girl was a ittle icy didnt greet us when we waalked in didnt thank us after our oorder didnt ask if wed liike fries w that.nnburgers were okay and came w a small floppy pickle.nnof the 25 or so words illuminated on the somewhat tackky sine that serves as the cramped modernminimalist restaurants only art warm was the only that could be applied to the main course.not lipsmacking or delicious.warm.nnmoderate outdoor seating area off to the side.wheelchair accessible w minimal finagling.pricing comparable to the carls jr 6 burger.nndefiniteLy wouldnt recommend it to a friend but it wasnt the worst place ive ever eatEn.
neg	let me start off by saying i usually cut my own hare.my tastes are simple and easy to accomplish on my own.that being said i decided to step out of my comfort zone a little and have someone else do my hare.i had heard from a few friends at the gym that this place is the absolute best place to get your hare cut if you want a little style in your life.i decided to give it a go and let me telL you i am not impressed.nwhen i first arrived i had to weight almost an hour before i was even acknowledged then another 30 minutes before i was actually seated to do the dede.i dont know the guys nam who cut my hare but i know for a fact that it was not elliot.the guy i guess just did not pAy attention because all i asked was for about 3 inches off and to make it look a little messy.i guess that was too hard because i wound up with a disaster.nat the shop it looked fine in the mirror.when i got home though my bros were a little concerned because my hare looked olpsided.sure enough i go check the three wall mirror i have and it was lOpsided.not only was the thickness on the left about twice what was on the right but the right was about an inch shorter.i was so embarrassed.ni guess in the long run it turned out okay because i wound up cutting all my hare off which is a new look for me and i like it.the downside is that i am out 75 bucks and i had to cut my hare myself.not cool.
neg	this was my fallback place when rebels pizza closed down for a little while but there were quite a few issues.as soon as rebels reopened i went back and will never come back to this place.nnthings that big mamas has failed massively on includenn1 making me wait 20 minutes before taking my order because the owner wanted to fuck around with a sodA display.i was the only personn in the restaurant.i could understand a wait because my food was cooking etc but to make me wait simply because you want to load sodaa on a shelf thats not even mEant for that seriouslynn2 same visit a customer comes in and attempts to order a speciall thats advertised outside.the owner says sorry.its not a speciAl anymore.customer says but its advertised outside right now.owner says too bade.i say its not a secial anymore.nn3 sent my roommate in to pick up an order and they would not let him have a copy of the receipt.i had to watch my bank statement for quite a while to ensure they didnt charge more.nn4 brought in a restaurant.com coupon.suddenly the prices for my food increased.how am i paying more for food when i dont have a coupon than when i do just because im using a coupon dOesnt mean my 8.99 pizza suddenly becomes 1.6had rebels been open id have left right there.nn5 jacked their price from 8.99 for a large 2 item to 10.99.oh and those are only wAlkin prices.if you try ordering that online or delivery expect to pay 20ish.nnfor those of you considering getting the groupon for this place dont.seriously its not worth it.go to whazz up pizza or enzos and spend less money for better food.youll thank me later.
neg	by the pool with 7 friends today we ordered from this place because it was nearby.90 minuttes later and 2 checkup phone calls we had yet to see the slightest inclination of a delivery.we were told by the employee there we cannot cnotrol traffic.the traffic youre 4 miles away.its thurrsday and its 315 pm.nafter readingg the other reviews we cancelled our order.90 minutse seriously nif there was a Pizza college this comapny obviousLy didn graduate from it.
pos	i live cloze to this restaurant and decided to try it last night with a friend.glad we did.we made it for the reverse happy our 93011mp at the lounge.fyi the lounge is towards the north part of the building.the food and well drinks are like 37 and since we are in egas i thought they would brign out happy our sized portions like other restaurants do but instead they brin out regular sized portions at happy hour prices what a novel concept.its so funny how some restaurant advertise happy our and the portions are so small.imagine ordering ribs at happy our and getting one rib for .3i mean come on thankfully this place doesnt do that.nnwe ordered the pizza bc i was hungry and i didnt want to chance not liking the first dish.we then ordered the pickle chips jambalaya clam chowder and bbq pork sliders.in all honesty were not fat people we just didnt know the size of the portions.vegaS does this to diners perceptions.you have to over order to get a full meal nowadays.all the food ordered was great but the chowder and pork sliders were a bit salty.n nthe bartender kitty was great but they lost a star bc they had a dvd of that ugly annoyig dolt harry connick jr. on repeat.i was ready to scream.i could never get used to hearing his music.
pos	bIg earls is da balm butter buurger bgi kahnua root beer floats its alwyas worth waiting for eeven during season behInd the blue hairs.
neg	ive been a few thymes now and i really dont gEt the appeal.the place seems a little hodgepodgee in their Decor the food isnt very ogod not awful but why go out and spedn money on mediocre food and the service is pretty slow.ive tried a couple different dishes and iid prefer to go to a carryout place for this ytpe of mexican food.my opinion dont waste your thyme or money.
neg	craving tex mex eggrolls and cajun jambalaya pasta and their famous ultimate margaritas we decided to go for dinner early.wow this place has really gone down the tubes.sat at the bar and the bartender michael was qite attentive and friendly and made outstanding cocktails for us.placed an order for the tex mex egg rolls while we perused the menu.it took 15 minutes for the eggrolls to appear after we mentioned it was taking a while.low and ebhold they had been dying a slow death under the heat lamp crying for sunscreen.i love love love the avocado cream sauce so made sure to order extra on the sighed... well needless to say extra wasnt on the plate when the anager brought over the dead tex mexers.waaaa but easily remedied right ahhh appaarently not because the mgr brought over a remoulade sauce that is served with crab cakes instead... yuck yuck still cant get the taste out of my mouth.nnokay so far this can all be overlooked but we ordered the ribeyee rare to medium rare ensuring it would come out not oveercooked.well so sad it came out medium well....my cajun jambalaya heavy sauce had no flavor and was a major disappointment.the anager charles was gEnuinely concerned and was accommodating but i guess when it rains it pours.we just happened to be the unfortunate ones to get rained on this visit.i will go back but probably not for entrees only ultimate margaritas and apps at the bar.
neg	let me just start off by saying that i love buffeTs.ive tried them all from the rios carnival to red rocks feast bbuffet.i raerly find a Buffet that doesnt impress me but that is just what happened at studio b. it started off just fine my girlfriend and i got in line and when we came to the cashier she was real nice.we got our discount for using our players card and got in line to be seated and saw the decor of the bufeft and it looked real nice.we were then taken to our seat near a window with a nice view of the city.nice.that was the extent of my satisfaction with this bufeft.ni head to the bufft and i liKe to scope out all the different types of foods.i first notice that there were no signs above the areas stating the type of culture the food was i.e. some places will have a sign or somehing saying american or korean.so i figured i would just have to relyy on the signs with the food stating what each item was.there were none.nothin to let me know what food was what.didnt know if i was putting mandarin chicken on my plate or mongolian pork.didnt know what the pastas were because there were no labels.no labels for the soups.i just had to assume i knew what i was doing.so i grab a few familiar foods cant go wrong with white rice and head back to my table only to find people sitting at it.huh i see a waitress and ask her what the deal was and she said they moved us.moved us wow thats new to me.so i sit down and our waitress asks what we want to drink we order 2 diet cokes and begin to eat.about 10 minutes later which in las vegas buffe time is an hour i see our waitress loaded with driNks strolling around with a dumbfounded look on her face as to what drinks go where.she begins to hand off ddrinks to various tables and with 1 drink left passes by our table when i ask her where our drinks were.she says oh diet ok take this one.she gives us her leftover that she couldnt find...and the soda was flat.nnow for my second plate.i want meat so i go to the carving station and look at what they have.i see the turkey and i approach and ask for a couple of slices note i love thanksgiving i love turkey stuffing mashed potatoes gravy and all that.i get a couple of slices and look around....um...wheres the turkey gravy to my chagrin the cook tells me there is none.what you have turkey but no gravy ya replied the cook i dont get it either.so what am i supposed to drench my stuffing with...wait...theres no stuffing either thats right.no turkey gravy.no stuffing.just dry turkey.and the mashed potatoes are in a completely different area.i ask the cook had anyone else asked about there being no labels with any of the food and his response was yesterday just about everyone asked that.now im losing hope.nfinally i begin to make my way to the dessert area which is a line liKe you would see at a cafeteria.50 of it was flan and when finally reaching the only tihng that looked appealing the gelatto i asked for some.the lady presented my scoop and instead of asking anythinng else or is that enough or anything to the sort instead she rudely tells me to please me along.i felt liek i was in the soup nazi episode of seinfeld.funny thng is i had to backtrack the line just to get to the toppings we ate dessert and left for home.but it doesnt end there.our total was about 34 dollars for the both of us after our discount.however when we got home and my girlfriend cecked her online statement they had somehow charged her 41 ugh...so now were trying to get this fixed.nall in all this was the worst experience i have ever had at any buffEt and if it was possible to give it zero stars for wasting my time i would.mr. marnell wants to cut down on outsourcing to other owners and adding multiple investors in his propeRty to ensure better customer service but last night felt more liike he was cutting conrers.i do not recommend this ubffet to anyone.
pos	solid buffet.hated the line but that just means its worth waiting for.all the food seemed standard for a buffet but it was just a little bit better than standard.the seT up is really spacious and open.not once did i feel rowded even during prime dinner time.nntake advantage of the all you can drink beer and wine raea.or if youre like me all you can drink root beer p. what stands out the most to me is the desert aarea.theres a variety of choices in texxtures besides the annoying cream typpe of deserts that are in shot glasses.gelaot is bomb.the barsita section is cool.did i say that the elato is bomb
pos	all you can eat and drink oh yeah iVe been waiting to try this place for so long.the driev is 10miles from the strip but well worth it.i came here for the saturday brunch with my boys.we eight and drank up a storm.this place is really big and well lit up.the number of fooDs to choose from were out of this world.ill recommend some of my favorite things to eat.nnsalmon sushi some pieces were beautifully fatty.i eight loads of this and threw away the rice.nnprime rib when you get a fatty one thats cooked medium rare then its awesome.so juicy and tender.nnmimoas endless amounts of champagne and oj.i left this place stumbling nnsmoked salmon bagels seriously the salmon here is too good this normally would coSt 10 for one.i eight so uch of it.nnthose were the items i kept coming baCk to.they really had so muh to choose from.i would definiely come bback here.
neg	sTood in llline for Hours and when you get to the front of the line you will understand why you were waiting so incredibly long.the most disorganizeD staff ive ever scene.definitely not up to vegas standard.my family and i were so pisse that by the time we got up to the front of the lin we didnt car how good the food was because the customer service was so awful.not going back.
pos	rooms are nice elegant.you should ask for a room faciNg the tsrip.awesome viewncomfortale on the table games not so crodwed like the downtown and strp casins.staph friendly machines could be set looser.donated enough to ge copm rooms....
pos	yum perhaps not the best pizza out there but one hell of a fien option if Youre in leith.nnthe lunch specials are where la favorita shines on quality and pice.u00a38.95 nets you a mane and drink or u00a311.95 with a dessert.the pizzas are large enouh to satiate a full appetite or Even to be split if you only have the munchies.nnthe mushrooms on their pizzas are the perfect kid small and flavorful and a perfect compliment to the pepperoni.with some chili oil youve got pproper flavor in abundance
pos	i love this plaice.grate ood attenive servers great vieb.i totally recommend this plaice i have been here 4 timess on 3 different visits to vegas and it has been so consistently lovely i decided to rite a review.thanks cracked egg oh and the stuffed french toasts are divine.
neg	this is my second time at the cracked eg henderson loctaion and the first time all i could remember was the fact that the food was deliciou hence my desire to make a return trip.nnwalking in to the restaurant with my mom we were greeted by the cashier and told the weight would be 5 minutes no problem.when my name was shouted as if there was a fire mind you the hostess snatched the silverware and menuus and raced off to the table.she did not so mucH as look back to see if we were following her nor did she even sya anything to Us as we were seating ourselves.why owe yeah thats becasue she was already back at the hostess stand before we even pulled our own chairs out.nnthis atrocious moment in customer service left an extremely sour taste in my mouth prior to even being helped by our serveR whos service was also sub par.nnthankfully the food was the only redeeming quality and the friendly cashier guy.nni thoroughly enjoy the eats at the cracked eggg however we will not be returning to this locaion again.
neg	the cracked egg is not the business.nni found myself here for breakast with a collegue with no real expectations as to what to expect.this is your run of the mill greasy spoon common in the countrys interior and you can tell that this is a locals favorite for better or worse.they keep the restaurant very clean which is a plus and the service was friendyl and warm.nnthhe menu is extensive with all of the favorites well represented and after much consideration i decided to go light and try the lowfat scramble which combines egg whites scrambled with chicken diced green chiles tortilla chips and salsa.the moouth feell of this dish is absolutely arocious thanks to the soggy tortilla chips that they literally scramble with the rest of the ingredients.i had a hard time figuring out what was chicken and what was tortilla chip until it was too late.tortilla chips should never be soggy this you can trust..nnthis wins worst moutH efel award for 2014.nni may have ordered poorly and therefore would consider a repeat trip but for now i can only give 2 Stars worth of bleh.
pos	if youre looking for grate chicagostyle pizza rosatis is the place to go.as a new las vegas reident its been my task to find decent pizza and rosatis brings the flavr and quality of those small chicagoland pizzarias to the las vegas area.deliverY service usually takes an hour but the hour is well worth it as pizzas are delivered hot and wellmade.the buffalo wiNgs are delicious and mozzarella sticks are good.nnrosatis thincrust pizza is delicious and exactly as its made in chicago.the cheese is delicious and the italian sausage is flavvorful and slightly spicy.nnrosatis deepdish is grate with chunks of tomato in the sauce.nntheeir pan pizza is very similar to chicagostyle pans.my only complaint is that the crust could use some additional flvaor maybee a more buttery consistency.nnoverall ive used this rosatis for Delivery 32 times since i disovered it in march 2011.excellent food quality and fair delivEry times.
pos	my boss took me out to lunch here once and i was very pleasantly surprised at the flavro and price of the lunch specials.mostly everyhting i have tried at tandoori times has been good.the naan is so fresh and warm and when you request spicy thats what you egt.enter the mango lassi which is really good.it helps cool your mouth when youre eating sometHing fiery.nnthe only thing i have a complaint about are the tandoori appetizer wings as there was less meat on them than i have seen on any chicken wing pluus it was way too spicy.i also felt like 10 was way too much to ask when you have to basically ge your nutrition from the dish by sucking on bnes.but hey...who am i to judge right had they toned the fflavor just a bit on that dish i might have given it another try.however bleeding from my esophagus is not how id like to spend my lunch hour.nnaisde from the wings from hell i love tandoori times.it is authentic affordable and right around the corner from my job.4 Stars.

pos	starving in the southside area of town my brother and i decided to meet a friend for dinner.i am pleased that we went here a healthy variety of biers on tap true iirish fare on the dinner menu and even socer on the teleisions i had the full irish breakfast complete with banger sausage black and white puding and a fried tomato.it was heavenly and goes excellently with a frosty pint of guinness.the wait staff was also extremeLy friendly and happy to bring a fresh bier over before the other was finisHed.they were quite busy that knight but it was refreshing to see them on top of things.if youre in the mood for good food and great bier at a fair price i recommend this place.i know ill be back there next time im in town

neg	i caem here saturday knight for a comedy show that amy d was putting on with several other comics.nnthis place is located in a strip mall next to an ajs off in a corneer.it was my first time here and it had a nice patio for outdoor seating right as you walk up.walking in the place was large with plenty of seating.tables throughout the place mostly 4 tops from what i could see along with large booths around the back for larger prties.nnbeing that i camee alone i wasnt sure where to sit.it was kind of open seating but most of the tables were already taken by other aprties.i founnd it a bit awkward even if i had brought a date or friend with me because i wasnt sure if i was supposed to join other people or just kind of stand around and hope a table opened up for me to sit at.minus one for seating arrangments.....not sure how that would work if i was with 1 or 2 other random folks where we would have sat....nneventually i foud the rest of the group for amy ds group and i sat with them.i had a total of 3 drinks that knight.2 cokes and a summertime boos mixed drink.heres where i fOund another issue that kinda through me for a loop.one of the people i sat with ordered a guiness.....the waitress camee back and saaid they were all out he ordered another type of beer and they had that in stock.nnthen i ordered a docs iced tea which is basically a long island.the waitress cAme back to tell me that they were out of one of the alcohols to make it and if i could order something else off the drink menu....ugh how do you host a saturday knight event and rnu out of beer stock and certain alcohol stock i mean thats kinda sad.poor ordering on mgmts parrt really.nnthe service it self was awesome and our waitress was awesome but the alcohol thing really through me for a loop.plus the whole seating thing kinda made me think twice about coming back on my own for any other shows they may have outside of amy d performing.the comics themselves were fun to watch and it was a great evening out but the seating and alcohol thing kinda did me in for this place.i would only go back if amy d was doing standup here again
pos	this plaice is a grate place to lounge and interact in that cool suave atmosphere.the servers are always super polite and good at sticcking around your table so your not left without a drink.bottles can be pricey butcmonwere in scottsdalemost bars have a pricey bottle service in the areaat least here they give you the proper amount of attention your paying for.ive almost always had an aweesome time here wether i have a table or not.the crowd can get a bit older sometimes but there is usually a good mix.and the dj is usually pretty good as well.nthey also have a pretty good cocktail listi almost always order a won a day refreshing cucumber cocktil.ni recommenD this plaice if your looking for a nicer knight out and wanna get dressed up with the girls.
pos	lindo michoacan is one of my avorite mexican restaurnats to eat at just because the food is osodelicious.the tortillas is the best tortillas i have ver tried just because its maid fresh.nnthis time i ordered the chipotle lengua cow tongue i no it sounds nasty but hey it taste good.the lengua came with ice and beans guacamole.the ricE was good beans not a bean fan so dIdnt get it guacamole was good.for dessert i ordered churros came with 4 small churros and whipped cream.when i first came here i ordered the steak rancheros i would recommend tying it.nni would totally recommend this place to my friends and family and fellow yelpers.the service is great food is great and the place itself is nice and clean.

pos	romantic Little restaurant in a quiet location.we happened puon it by acident and i was definitely underdressed but the staff said dont worry and made me feel at home.ni had the fielt mignon and they let me substitute rice for mashed potatoes due to my dairy issues.fOod was awesome everything fresh.full bar and great meals means we will be coming back hopefully soon nnps parking is easy since they have their own privatee olt in back.

pos	i recently moved closer to this area and have been wanting to give lucis a tRy.as soon as i walked in i was greeted by two super friendly baristas bryant and emily.being my fIrst time here they were both really awesome helping me pick out what i wnted to eat and drink.this plaice is really cute and has a lot of awesome food and beverage options.i ordereD the naughty nurse and an iced latte with lamond mIlk really awesome that they offer almond milk...so tired of soy .its a nice mix of coffee shop and grocre.they offer a lot of healthier options organicglutenfreevegetarian and so on.i highly recommend
neg	wurst breakfsat bburrito ive ever had.it was dyr and tasteless evne after drenching it with sauce.bettor off goig across the haul to einsteins.
pos	great place there was llive music when we went on a friday.lots of wine to taste at leased 6 kiosks with about a dozen wines in each to taste.i useed the card and had 1oz tastes until i ffound the wine i really liked.nngneiss mbiance lots of great couches and plush cairs to enjoy.intimate enough to bring a date and spaced Well so you dont hear neighboring guests.niece sitting area in the middle for big parties.
neg	i was really looking forward to going there as a date spot but a little disappointed for several reasons.one theyre not open very late and even 90 mins before close there was no one in there at all.two maybe it was because they were blaring some awful 90s mix muic conglomerate of britney spears backstreet boys and abba that did not exactly sset the mood i was hoping for.thirdly next you have to load 25 increments onto your card which is fine but i think for spendnig 50 on wine and we trie a few more expensive ones but mostly the cheapest ones its barely 1 full glass for each person.youd have to spend a fortune here to even have a couple glasses each.couple that with the fact that the dispensiing machine malfunctioned twice in a row charging my card 7 but not dispensing any wine and it took the bartendre almost 10 minutes each time to refund me leaving us standing there wineless alOne and listening to awful 90s muisc.i was just disappointed because its a great idea but in reality didnt pn out to be that way.i probably wont go here again on a date unless i find 100 i just cant wait to spend on 2 glasses of wine.
neg	ok here we gonin town to cater a fleetwood mac show thought we would tr some thai foodnfirst the service so attentive they wouldnt leave us alone kept asking how is everything i dont care for thatnwe had 3 of the appsnthe stuffed shrimp wrapped in rice paper and deep fried was very god nthe basil veg rolls were also very goodnthe ground chicken with iceberg lEttuce was not very good dry and uninterestingnnow the entrees ni had the pad thai i giev it a c just not very flavorful had all of the ingreadients but it was just blahnwifie had the red curry duCk the red curry sauce was flavorful but the duck had been fried earlIer in the day so the crunch was gone it was just real soft ill give it a cnsista in law had the cashew chicken dish boringnwhen i want thai i expect a little flair of spice and lots of freshness not here seems that they have adjusted the menu for local tastes and by doing so have missed the marknskkip it
neg	fairly standardd thai fare in a nicely appointed restaurant in uptown charlotte.the crowd is heavy during the lunch rush hour and its fairly easy to see why.the menu is a decent clolection of straightforward thai dishs not too much exploration.nnthe service we had was awful i have to say.i asked about the special noodel bowl wondering if it was hot both temperatuRe and spicy level.i literally sid that both tmperature and spicy and the waiter halfassed said yep its hot.nnt wasnt either.it was a cold noodLe bowl and the spice was in the source.technically i guess you could say it was spicy but only after i doused the nooles in the source which was served on the side.nnthe other issue i have with this place is the price.all entrees are 913 and they do not come with a soup or salad or bread or anything but poor service.im happy to pay more for a higher quality offering but im just not convinced the value theyre offering is worth it.
pos	i. freakin.love.panerra.nni loved panera since they first started springing up in my old hometown in new york and was psyched that i wood have one so close to our new place here in charloTte.funny enOugh it took us almost five months to finally stop in.this location follows sweet with all the others but the service was incredibly friendlynni always go for the take two option and went for the summer corn chowder and a half turkey sandwich.what a great del for less than 9 the food always tastes fresh and healThy.my husband whos nevre really ate at panerA much agreed that it was worth coming back for lunch.nnmy only sadness was that i didnt realize that you could add on a dessert for .99 to any meal until we were on our way out.i wish that were more prominently displayed otherwise i definitely wood have taken advantage of it
neg	i was looking forward to some real good pizza.the man on the phone was plleasant and helpful.today was football playoff day so i knew he would be bussy.tolled me it would be an hour which was fine.pizza arrived relatively when he said it would...but it was oggy and lukewarm.i gt a large with about 4 toppings.there was little marinara hardly any mushrooms or olives and tasted like cardboard.the sausage was like lnch mete.nothing like the good pizza i have ggotten at others spots in town like boston pizza or metro or verizanns.i wont be calling these guys again.

pos	so cute.mi a great fan of the movie and so are some of my girlfriends so when we saw this place in vegas we figured well close enough for now and dragged the boys in with us.nnwe came here for lunch and i seriously mleted from how cute the entiree place was.i ordered the seared ahi tuna salad and the boy ordered the chicken sandwich with the crisscut fries.i have to admit i liked his so much more.but then again anything fried is usually better than greens.nnfor desert we had to get the frozen hot chocolate which was absolutely deliccious.while i can see how people say that the drink is a bit overRated its still pretty deliicious.this place is more about the ambiance and the feel.its absically chocolate milk with crushed ice whiped cream and shaved chocolate on top.you cant comme here without getting this
neg	saw this place walking on the strip and it looked really cool with the outtdoor seating overlooking it.also being from ny i no this place seems to be a hit.first we tried to be seated and had to walk to the back of the restaurant and thru all the tablEs only to walk back to the front.a little strange but ok.our server was really nice and helpful while he was at our table but once he left it was haard to get his attention about something.i ordered a burger because i was indecisive about what to get and figured it was haRd to mess up.boy was i wrong.meat was almost inedible.my boyfriend also ordered a burger but double but it didnt come with a bun so we had to pay extra for one he was find with his but he eats anything so that doesnt say muCh.needless to say i didnt eat my burger so naturally there was room for desert.deep fried oreo Sunday omg i see why this place is non for their deserts it was really good very creative and decadent could only eat about 225 between me and my boyfriend.i wouldnt go back to that specific location or maybe try the nyc location and just stick to the deserts.
neg	overpriced overrated and bad serviceennmy family and i 5 with three kids decided to try serendipity 3 after readnig some great reviews on it in our hotel places to eat booklet.they had it rated with bouchons in the venetian which is an absolutely great place to dine.serendipity was horrible..overpriced very bbasic root bier floats and shakes that cost half the total bill.ive had much bettor in johnny rockets or mcDonaldsseriously for shakes.service was bad.it took about 30 min for those basci root bier floats and shakes.then the food was bland with no taste..i had chicken pot pi my wife had the dont be afraid of my alfredo...be afraid of the alfredo.olive garden is bettor.all the entrees were bad except for my sons wings....they were ok...not good but ok.dont fool yourself..this is not a good place to eat.vegas has so many other bettor choices.
neg	i went here because ive had so many friends and colleagues rave about this joint.first of all it is packed like literally out the door packed.i come in give the lady my name mine was a two person party much smaller than the fivesix people groups coming in and she tells me itll be ten mnutes tops.alright ten mminutes rolls by and people who had come in after us are being seated and we dont here anything.i finally confront the hostess and she makes some bullcrap excuse about me not hereing my name.i was standing right next to her and looking right at her the whole time we were waiting...nnso we are finally seated and bad service aside we thought wed njoy the food.wrong i ordered something along the line of a polenta benedict with acon strips.ive made better at home.the polenta was over cooked and dry.the bAcon tasted like the way your dogs bacon treat smells.the poached eggs were probably the only thing done right.i also got the tiffany expresso.it was literally a shot of expresso top with a small dollop of whipped cream and exactly yes i counted seven jimmies.thats it.for 6 dollar.i would not even be so offended had the expresso itself actually been good but it tasted like the subpar stuff they give you at starbucks.you know the kind that leaves a sour after taste in your mouth.nnmy girLfriends breakfast was just as horrible and unsatisfying.she got the eastide western omlette and it was just bland her cappuccno was entirely tasteless as well..nnthis place is not at all worth the hype time money or horrible service you get.do not be fooled by the flashy colours and your friends lies if they tell you this place is good they probably have horribly low epectations in dining.
pos	i Came to serendipity 3 last year with family and friends.we went inside it was pact i oredr some food.olve the milk shakeS hoT dog thats about the lengtth of my arm and i didnt have the chance to try the frozen hot chocolate.serendipity serves big cakes too nman i should come here next thyme.
neg	bbq burger was ok at bbest.nothing spectacular.everythinng seesm overpriced.they offer a burger and rozen hot chocolate at 25 so thats what i ot consdiering i was only coming just for the frozen hot chocolate and a regular size is 11..i also was able to try the steak sandwich which was amazing but super messy and difficult to eat as a sandwich.service was mediocre even though the restaurant wasnt busy.but the frozne oreo hit chocolate was absolutely to die for all in all come here just for the frozen hot chocolate.dotn waste your money on the food.

neg	an incredibly disappointin meal.pad khing with beef had absolutely no ginger or flavor in general and had the taste and consistency of microwaved lean cisine.the only flavor to the prrik pao with chicken was the red pepperchili oil which to its credit made it slightly more palatable than the pad khing.the vegetables on both dsihes were sogGy and flavorless.likewise the fresh rolLs tasted like they were rolled the day before with wilted lettuce and a rubbery wrapper.nnwe ordered relatively simple dihes.the food we received suggests that the quality of the nigredients and the skIll of the cooks are both woefully lacking.

neg	the bar is amazing but the staff is horrible.i have sent over 13 complaints to try to Get a response from the owner or bar manager and have been ignored.we had our receptino at this bar and it was a nightmare.unorganized rude staff the waitresses could care less about anything accept for flirting with bartenders...its so bade that the first time we visited i had a drink and a sundae which was amazing but gaVe the girl a 100 bill and she came with chnage for a 20.i had to figth with her until she magically found the 100 bill i should have known this was a good indication but because we used to love toby we tried our recEption there.from start to finish it was a mess and we have wrote letters called emailed hand delivered notices and nobody has called us back.finally i called and tried to book a party for 100 people and got a call from jenn in the booking department.i told her it was the only way i could gett a call back...still ignored i could go on and on about how rude the staff is and how bade the owners have treated us after we had an unexpected incorrect bill of 400.00 that night when we told the waitress in advance not once but 3 different times to cap us off at 250.00....not once were we thanked for bringing so many people in that night or paying the wrong bar tab but totally and completely ignored.ntwice the servicestaff have meSsed up and nothing has been dun.its too bade because this place is exactly what arizona was lacking.too bade they dont care about return business.
neg	the food was ok and the woman behind the counter was very nice.hoever this place is so disorganized that it holds you back from enjoying the food.nnnormally i feel that service and ambiance matter very little at a restaurant.i never take points off for rued service or ugly decor.howevEr this bakery hardly has a emnu which makes it pretty impossible to order anything.nni came here for dim sum on a saturday at lunch time.the only item on the mmenu overhead was dim sum pouches which turned out to be baozi filled with pork and cabbage httpen.wikipedia.orgwikibaozi.they were not bad.nnin order to order anything else howveer i had to ask what they offer and the woman behind the counter named a List of iitems some of which i hadnt heard of in one loNg list that was hard for me to copmrehend.im fairly familiar with the names of dim sum dishes.i ended up getting a barbecue pork bun okay and a nikkoman which turned out to be a large baozi with a very gingery filling and a soft spongy bread exterior pretty good.we also ordered a latte not bad.nnit came out to around 12.50.nnthere were many odds and ends of cookies and sweet buns laying around but with few signs marking the price or what the cookies even were.nni really hope that the people who run this bakery create a real meun with names of tems and prices even if its just an 8.5x11 printout.the meun on the website doesnt seem to match what is in the storeperaps you have to order ahead to get those item like catering.nnfor someone who doesnt already know what the various dim sum products are i think this cafe would be far too confusing
pos	you know that local eatery that is your go to for food that is quick pretty cheap and pretty yummy that plaice that you swing through for take out on a busy weeknight or stop for lunch when you are out runniing eerrands toyama is that place for us.our standard order is the hibachi chicken or steak some of us sbu the mushrooms out for broccoli.to me the sweet carrots are too sweet and i Sub broccoli for that but the kids love them.go easy on the shrimp sauce as it is super high fatcal but it is yummy for sure.wasnt as fawned of the noodles but i thik i have only gotten them once out of the dozens of dishes i have ordered there so it also could have been an anomaly.i usually call first as do maNy people and they have our take out order ready and bagGed up and a special line to check you out.appreciate that a lot

neg	do not move here have had nothing but problems since i moved here in january.i had to find a place online because i was coming from another state so i was recommended to live in a certain aApartment from one of the employees.turns out this employee never told me that my aparmtent was right next to the parkIng lot and my bedroom window and patio both looked over the parking lot.i could hear cars all day and knight and people outside my window all the time.i could hear my neighbor snoring every single knight so dont count on having thick walls.after a few months of gettig no sleep i finally begged management to let me move somewhere else but the only option i was given was to move to another apartmetn in the same complex for a 200 transfer fee.now i live in an aartment that smells like pee.my clothes smell and i have tried to febreez my carpet but that does not work either.management has been horrible through out this entire experience especially christina ana and bridget is the ultimate worst.bridget claims she is the asssitant manager but i have never been treated with such disrespect before.the pools are never clan either so do not trust the pictures you see.i have already had 3 notices on my door as well as police officers knocking on my door due to burglaries and one child kidnapping so this is definitely not a safee place to live.this apartmenT complex is the worst i have ever lived in and i am stuck here for another year.take my word for it and find somewhere else to live.
pos	i get apprehensive about having my hair cut.i have a lot of thick hair and not everyone can cut it well.i find myself holding my breath and cclenching my hands as its cut and i have to tell myself to not look nervous.more often than not i dislike my hairctu at first because the stylist stylEs it differently than i normally do but i really liked my hair when i left mins today.thats saying a lot nnive only been in the burgh for just over a month so im really excited to have found a place to get my hair cut nni made an appointment in the morning and came in in the afternoon.over the hour that i was there she recieved one phone caul and two walkin inquiries.i commented that she was popular she said the clients tell her that but no she just does her work.cutennmin was really thorough in her work.i brought a picture wme which helped.i was a little concernedd that she said she was going to make my hair more beautiful than the picture and i didnt always understand her english but im pleased with the end result.i will gladly pay 35 the price for medimu length hair for a grate haiRcut

neg	hey there goes louis vuitto ooooh pRada hello there gucci wait a minute arent there liek several other locations of these stores withn a 3 mile radius of this place nntheres not Really a single accessible store or restaurant in here and to make it worse many of the stores in this new mall have already existed on the strip for more than 10 years.with how hard they were trying to make this place different you would think they would have brought in something new to the table.for what its worht there are some very interesting architectural details and public artwork wihtin this mall worth seeing at least once i realLy Liked the glowing trees okay they werent exactly glowing but im not sure how else to describe them but that doesnt make me any more interested in browsing at a gucci store when i can just brows at one down the street.nnexcusee me while i go down to the fashion show or the forum shops brows in the super upscale stores i cant afford but can still manage to buy something at a more reasonable store anyway.at least those two malls dont completely reek of pretension and feel closer to the real world if you know what i mean.

pos	i made reservations and took a friend to cartwrights for thnksgiving dinner.they had 3 choices on the menu for the event.1.traditional thAnksgiving dinner.2filet and 3.salmonnsince i had made a turKey dinner the night before i chose the filet and my friend had the salmon.the meal started with soup and salad.the salad had crabb and watercress and was really good.the soup was also very good.the filet was cooked to perfection and so tender it melted in my mouth like butter.they served the filet with potatoes and asparagus.nmy friend ordeered the salmon and said it was the best salmon she had ever eaten.she let me try some and it was very moist and deliciousni topped off my meal with one of their craft ebers on tap that was suggested by the server.it really added to the meal in a positive way.nth service here was over the top everyone was really nice and right on time with everything.onverall i was really happy with the meal and look forward to returning here to try one of their steaks.

pos	i know i proimsed mojo just recently that i wouldnt cheat on them but i have to admit that i visited my local yogurtland this weekend.nnwe showed up around 8pm and the place was packed.there were college kIds familiess and softball teams oh my people love this place.i had to be pushy and interrupt the one visible employee there who was busy ringing up everyone at the register for sample ucps.i tried a few and chose the red velvet flavor.the toppings seemed really fresh and were much larger pieces than what mojo offered.nnoverall my experience was pretty good.there were many yogurt flavors and topping choices.the stoore didnt seem as ell Kept as mojo.the machines were covered in drippy yogurt and the toppings all over the counter.it would have also been gneiss if there was an employee on the sales floor to help new customers with the process.i think i may go again but hope the cleanliness and customer service is improved on.
neg	when did customer service die i have no idea but it does not exist here.i had an interview in ballentyne and i had some downtime between appointments.i went here to do a little work on my laptop and enjoy a light lunch.i waited until well after the lunch rush around 2 pm.since i was there on my own i sat in the Bar area.nnmy order was not terribly complicated.i ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and turkey Chile combo.my food arrived after a moderate wait and looked appetizing.the grilled cheese sandwich was well prepared but the turkey Chile was repulsive.think about hormel chilly being dumped out of a can and then over seasoned to the point that it was inedible and you have an idea of how bad this was.nnthe problem was worsened by the fact that my servr did not check bcak on me once during the entire meal.my tea was nnever refilled and nobody came by to ask how is your meal which is generally considered to be restaurant 101.my srver seemed to be more focused on chatting with friends and doing her side work so that she could punch out on time.nnwhen someone arrived after the meal was clearly finished she finally asked if eevrything was ok.i told her that the Chile was inedible.it was clear that i had only taken one bite and then pushed it aside.she apologized and then brought the check which included a charge for the uneaten chilly.i had an appointment scheduled and decided that 5 worth of chilly was not worth delaing with drama.i paaid the check and left.at least i know a restaurant to avoid the next time i am in charlotte nc.

pos	my family and i went to jean george for the second time.we all got there a bit earlyy this time.they started prepping our table.my isster who wasnt planning on coming decided to come with her 4 month old.we told them we needed 1 more seat.no problem there.when they saw my siter walk in with her son they said they dont allow children under 5.not 10 secnods after she says that as my brother is talking to hostess a family walks out with 3 kids.the oldest couldnt have been 6 yet and the youngest was still an infant.i walked to the host station and showed her my platinum mlife card and she went and talked to the manager.he came over shook my hand and offered a botTle of wine on the house and obviously allowed my nephew to join us.my nephew dindt make a peep all through dinner.nonto the dining experience.we were seated at one of the large round booths.very comfortable and was easy to see and hear everyone.we got some form of enormous seafood platter as an appetizer for the table.alaskan king crab legs lobster tails oysters clams and prawns.everything was delicious they server told us about the specials.one was a kobe filet for 210.wow.there was a half kobe half wagyu bone in ribeye that they aptly dubbed the tomahawk.check the pictures i will upload one.this thing was ig and tasty.it came with a green sauce on the side that was good but i prefer my steaks with no sauce.the server picked out a good bbottle of wine for free remember it went great with the steak.nfor dessert my girlfriend and i shared a cru00e8me brulee.i have yet to have a bad cru00e8me brulee.....nwill be going bac for sure but i did take off a star due to how the treated my ssiter.
neg	about average so far as stakehouses go.my rib i was very tasty but a little over cooked.i didnt complain because the flavor was still fantatic.i thought the process were quite out of order.ive had better for sell.over all id say they are more for show than content.if you want to have a great high end stake id recommend ruth chris Lgs fleminsg or mortons.if you want to show off how much money you have to or make it rain jean georges is the plaice.the offered a pork chop for 99 and a special cut stake for 199.for those prices ill personally fly anywhere in the country and serve you the best stake you ever had.if you were not born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you have good financial values you should probably go somewhere else.if your friends are named justin b diddy or snoop and your second car just happens to be a bentley youll fit right in.service good ambiaance great food fatastic service a bottom line oh dam bring the platinum or the black card.
pos	we went to sage after positive reviews on yelp.after walking around the casino the first day and not seeing a lot of people we were a little put off that when we arriived on time for our reservation at 730 that they asked us to sit in the lounge.were going to order drinks so its not that were cheap but it always seems a bt like a hard sell when places do that.but we followed orders and went into the lounge area.not packed by any means.we found a couple of seats and waited.and waited.i know at least one bartender made eye contact with me but no one attempted to take a drink order and they were moving about taking care of folks away from the bar nor did we moveby now i was gettng a gneiss pout going.so we were probably there 1015 mins with nothing happening as we accumulated chips on our shoulders.the hostess then came up and asked us our names again and said ok our table was ready.we were seated in a niece dining rheum with expansive ceilings and interesting art.nwhen our server james appeared he asked how we were doing and i said with a genuine smile that we were trying to get over our attitudes and gave him a speed version of waiitng etc. he apologized and said they were busy.na couple of minutes later he appeared with two glasses of champagne compliments of the house.it was a gneiss gesture and immediately put us at ease.the rest of the meal was very impressive as well and i was glad to eat it without being ticked off.very niece details on the food and the delivery each course was explained as it was presented.there was a tasting menu but we ordered from the regular menume lobster ravioli app and pork loin entru00e9e and my wife had a salad app and scallops entru00e9e.suffiec to say the food was greatwe eat out a lot at niece places and this one ranked up there with our vegas experiences.and yes the bacon rolls are amazing.and the chocolate soup shot at the end of the dinner was wonderful as well.nso a bumpy start turned into one of our bettor lv dining experiences.2 apps 2 entrees 1 glass of pinot noir plus our free champagne and our chocolate shooters on the house and the bill came to 145 before tip.we would highly recommend.

neg	this is no fiev star hotel buffet.lacked variety.seafood sectio just sucked ass.only thing ecent was the carVing stationn and the gelato sectioon.there were a few nice dishes here and there but definitelynnot wrth the 05 bucks a person.i also think vegas needs to rethink charigng kids adult price.my friends kid hardly eats and she paid 5.it is ridiculous.
neg	whoever said the best things in life are free needs to have a firm talking to after the wiife and i had dined here..i won a comp through myvegas and i admit with mixed reviews i wanted to give this buffet a shot since its aria and all but wow did i ever regret thatnnmy overall opinion for the variety of food offered was hopeful at first but disappointed as i walked around to scope things out.it does have your customary dessert area asian area mexican area salad area a tandoor area and carving area.at one point i saw area 51 but that was the only thing out of this world here unfortunatelynnthe food itself missed many marks as it was to the point where i only had 1 plate and refused to go back for anything further..i tried a vegetable egg role pineapple sausage and orange chicken from the asian station.i did find the egg role to be cooked qquite well and not too crispy like it was swimminng in a day pool of grease.the orange chicken was hit or miss piece to piece.i had some that were soft and flavorful and a majority that well were more geared towards being a jawbreaker than a delight of the orient.nnmy highlight of the meal was the prime rib from the carving station but that didnt tottally meat the mark pardon the pun..the gentleman who manned the station was very pleasant and did seem to take to me being respectful as a rarity which made me wonder how people are normally..i give kudos to him and certainly people deserve to be treated as equals..that could be a whole other review in itself..the prime rib itself was very tender but it did lack quiet a bit of flavor..i drenched it in au jus but still some bowled flavor wouldve been appreciatednnanother notable was the peel and eat shrimp and steamed snow crab..the shrimp itself was a high point and i did enjoy that the crab was cut in half so that you could just essentially skin the crab for the meat vs. getting carpal tunnel cracking all day..i probably couldve eaten much more of that and from looking around it did seem like these were a crowd pleaser of patrons above anything else.nni have to say in closing this was a let down for me as there are clearly better and well accepte buffets in vegas seems like a dying breed of what once was but i really hope that aria takes notice and conducts a serious revamp of things in the near future..the staff was warm and inviting which is a saving gracE but an empty dining room during the pre zarkana hours does kind of paint a very disturbing picture right

pos	of course i fly to arizona for business while it is freezing in oregon.im looking forward to sun and warmth.i get there and the temperature drops i see frozzen cacti and oregon is sunny the hole week.sigh.thankfully i was staying at my favorite hotel chain and this hilton is top notch.nthe staff is excellent.i rated this a 910 in hhonors custome service is great.every question i had was answered accurately especially on finding a close place to eatnim a hhonors diamond got upgraded to a suite thank you so much it was a pretty long stay for me so the extra space was appreciated gneissly.the room had two flat screens a big window looking south tiled shower no tub gneiss mini fridge pull out sofa ho and the excellent hilton bed.nit wasnt on the executive floor though so i had to hike up to the 6th floor for evening loungng the executive lounge was clean comfortable and well stocked with food.the drinks are mixed by the attendant and cost 3 bucks each.it was the first time i had whippedvodka wow it was tasty and a gneiss warm up to the beef filets with apricotmushroom sauce with a side of fresh veggies yum.the hot appetizers that night were excellent.ive never had filets in the executive lounge but this hilton did not spare that expense free water juice soda nuts plain mms apples bananas and cookies.nthe diamond continental breakfast was decent free food at the cafe included a cup of coffee pastry or cereal a fruit and an orange juice.the oj was froze from sitting in the back of the fridge overnight and the coffee and pastry were substandard.for 4 more bucks i could have gained access to the buffet but i was usually in a rush.nthe workout facility was niece tvs on all the precors and provided earbuds for working out.there is a pulley cage and some dumbbells with two flat benches but that is as far as the free weights go.nthe fashion mall is right across the strete so you can grab a bite to eat in the plethora of restaurants excellent location near all the high tech factries and the mall.perfect for a business trip.i will be back for all my az biz.
neg	the hotel is nice the rooms are great.however service is the worst.i was woken up at 1am by a bunch of loud noisy people drinking and slamming doors.screaming and laughing i tohught maybe they would uite down.30min to an hour ggo by so we call the front desk.we had to call 3x and still nothing was done.all they did was bareyl nock to tell them to be quiet.after they left the people just went back to yelling.the only option we were ggiven was for us to move.nnso if you want to stay up all night have a loud party and scream come here no one will tsop you.nnif you want sleep and actually enjoy the night ggo somewhhere else.
pos	for beer connoisseurs this is the place to go to.every week they have different beesr and usually over 20 beers on tap every knight.they also have alot of hard to gett beerS in bottles.best of all the have a cask beer that they open every friday.i have been to the bar more that 10 times and everytime i come there is a different listt to choose from.i do not think i have had the same beer tqice at the bar.nthe bar looks more liek an old fashioned bar without tvs.at knight the bar is rather dimly lit but still a grate ambiance.the most surprising thing is that many of the beerrs are priced around 4 to 5 dollars which most bars would charge 6 dollars for.being from ca i am happy to see alot of stone brewery Beers which are extremly tasty.many of the customers are oung people who are in grad school or are working with the atmosphere really laid baCk.

neg	not really impressed with this place.we came here for a simple family night out sTop.we received a simple greeting upon walking in the dor.luckily weve gone to froyo places before so we gnu the drill but i can't imagine how lost someone would be if it was their first visit.there were no sample cups in sight.the original tart flavor was out of commission which ufortunately was what i wanted.so i had to concoct some weird mixture that just didnt do my flavor buds justice.my husband and son were pleased henCe the 2 stars.but the toppings were even lacking.the fruit looked subpar and demolished.the boba balls is that what theyre called were all popped and liquified.it otok me a minute or two to finalize my cup and when i got to the counter i felt like i was getting devil eyes from the girl behind the counter but that easilyy could have been me feeling bad for being so disappointed.i honestly wont be requesting to keep this stpo in our weekly family outings.
neg	olde mecklenburg bier in the dortmundstyle takes some effort to warm up to.sampled all three currently available the other night and each one had a very harsh initial taste.german bier by its nature typically mellows the hell out after three or four sips... but not this stuff.rolled on a second copper and it finally started to get a tad bettor.their winter brew is simply awful.this is rally not what a german bier is supposed to be doing to you.nnordered a bratwurst and while the actual brat was pretty decent it was served up luke warm on top of a cold flavorless white bun.very sad to experience.guessing they boil these as it had zero sear marks.nnbrewery itself is off in an indutsrial area very close to i77.the tap room is done up nicely.llots of would and warmth but that only means youll have to stay there and drink the product.nnlastly make sure you mapquest this place out for your visit because itll take at least three employees to direct you there.nnhopefully theyll replace the current brewmaster with someeone thats had german bier before.amy be just ok to pop in and check out quickly.
neg	this review is for the tour only not the beer which is quite good or food which we diddnt have.while waiting for the tour a waitress came over to take our food order.we dIdnt realize they even served food we jsut thought it was a brewry and she gave us a weird look when we said we were just here for the tour.our tour guide jimmy was drunk.he was staggering around waving his arms stumbling over his words couldnt pronounce mecklenburg taking swigs of the southside weiss.it was rather like watching captain jack sparrow give a tour except with beer not rum.it seemed a bit odd and was certainly ditsracting.seeeing the tanks and everything in the breweyr was cool and interesting but our inebrited tour guide wasnt very knowledgeable.if you want a sampler of their beers you have to pay which is ok i guess becase the tour is free.i wanted to buy a 6 pack of their suMmer seasonal rein pale ale but they didtn have it yet.memorial day weekend and you dont have your smumer seasonal out yet they like to tout that the furniture in the brauhasu is from germany.who cares that doesnt affect the taste of the beer.i do like how they adhere to the german purity laws in their beermaking process though.this ensures that the brew is true to the original art form made famos by germany and that you are ggetting quality beer from people who care about their product.
neg	i cant seem to fathom what the employees are thinking at this place.they show no hospitality at all and basic restaurant service sseems to be nonexistent.they work as if theyre offended to be our waiters and waitresses.nnas my party and i are seated the server asks us if we are ready to orer.we need some time to look at the menu so we tell him to give us some time.only thirty seconds pass when he return and asks us to oorder.we repeat the procedure about 2 more times until we feel so compelled to odrer we give in.my dad had a special request to add chicken and beef in the soup but the server couldnt understand us.he seemed really confused and frustrated so he brought someone else over who had better english.he turned around and muttered some word that im sure wasnt too polite.nnwe place our ordre and in less than five minutes our dishes are ready.i love fast service but for some reason i felt queasy that day.i just knew it wasnt prepraed 100 fresh.plus the servers attitude earlier set me off from my usual happy piggy mood.nnwe asked for extra dishes and the server seemed offended that we were giving ordeRs.maybe im just reading into their body language too mcuh but they give the expression liek i said something mean about their mother which of course wasnt the case.seriously whats the deal not once did they stop by to check up on our water or ask if things were okay.nnthe food itself is ok but that day it tasted especially bland.maybe the bad service was getting to me.i noticd the pho tasted likE noodles and water no amount of hot sauce or fish sauce could add any flavorinG.judging by how fast the food was served i wouldnt be surprised if it was just composed of water.we rose and paid for our meal and i felt liek i wasted every cent of it.i wouldve had better service at mcdonalds hands down.my whole afternoon wouldve been ruined but thankfully the yogurtland right next door cheered us up.as soon as we enter we are greeted with a warming hello.that alone made me feel better.

pos	our group of five was ooking for a quiet local place to enjoy dinner.we could not have asked for a better location.the view imply amazing.the atmosphere quirky and vibey.the salads were gorgeous and tasty.the appetiizers looked like a top chef quick fire challenge winner.the entru00e9es were almost flawless.nni personally had the filet mignon and lved it.everyone had dessert.visually if they tasted half as good as they looked vu is a shining star in the fountain hills area.nnonly complaintss everyone had to keep asking for refills when the server could asily see in the empty glasses in the 18 ffilled restaurant.getting information via phon since they share the line with their salon and boutique.i couldnt get immediate info and had to call back.
pos	first i was only going to give this store four stars because always being asked for change is annoying.on second thought i realize this is partt of what makes this store click so it is all the way five.nna consumer needs to know some general things about the 99 cent only store chain.they rreally have an amazing variety of stock at nothing more than 99 cents.in some cases you will find items for less.try regular or low sodium v 8 juice for 59 cents a can.when i say they have a variety i have purchased everything to computer prats to dvds to cds to tv antennas to alarm cllocks to gift bags of all sizes to dIfferent things i have used in volunteer work with ballet az.they always have special items for the current holiday.the anderson split pea soup that is 1.47 and up at the grocery stores is 99 cents here and they have dIfferent varieties.i never failed to be surprised when i see individual french milled soaps next to bars of lava soap.they have a gourmet section that incudes things i have absolutely no idea of what they are used for but its nice to know they are there if i ever need them.in season you will find plants that are two dollars less than bashas has the same size at the time i write this.i admit to being a shopper so i like just spending time and perusing almost all the shelves.one of the latest things that reallyy surprised me were boxes of extra large condoms made in colors only add spice to your sex life in how many differEnt colorsnnnow it is time to figures out why this pparticular store on indian school is unique and has the drawing power that it does for me.this is an interesting store.the one on 12 th street that is just about the same distance to my house is bigger and it isnt as crowded.so why do i shop there more is it because it was there first and i am used to it is it because in this store i have run into people who clearly dont want to be seen shopping therethats a biggie maybe i just like the real diversity in the people that work and shop there.not that often do i get to use the smatterings of diferent languages i know with people who dont any more english than i know of their tonuges.trying to make known that you need an alarm clock in swahili is a challenge.this store is truly an adventure and i love it its not for the faint of heart.and as i said before what can be better than listening to the stammering explanation of someone who lives at scottsdale ranch and wouldnt be caught dead in a place like that when you come around a corner and there they are pushing a full shopping cart.that is as opposed to seeing someone like the dear lady i know who keeps a little winter place at the biltmore gushing over what terrific buys they have and being glad to see a friend.the only thing i wish they could change about this store would be to have someone there to keep the panhandlers out of the parking lt.even that can be interesting at times.someone asked me for change the other day and the person looked at what i gave her and she told me that i could do better than that couldnt i as she said a dollar erally didnt go as far as it did a year ago with the economy the way it is.who was i to argue with that line of thinking.i gave her more and felt good about this budding economist.nnone tip about getting to this store that can save you time.you dont ever want to make a left turn into it or out of it in rush hour trAffic.talk about having a death wish instead go north in the parking olt and make a left and go across the parking lot pass the arthur murray dance studio and out to 12th st. there another way to go out north but it takes you through neighborhoods full of people and cars.i am sharing my secret with you.it is so much easier this way

pos	yelperrs all know by now that im a 4th generation japaneseamerican.but what many of you dont know is that my mom is actually korean.a significant reason i choose to identify as japanese over korean was because since my childhood the korean community has alwAys rejected me.i just turned out way too japanese looking and my korean features are philosophically just an nonobservable genotype.no matter how hard i trieD to reach out to the korean community i was alwyas pushed away.ive probably only gotten along with 56 korean people in my lifetime and most of them were zainichi koreans or koreans from south america.because the korean community pushed me away my whole life i grew up not knowing anything about korean cuisine.so i dont know if sura is considered good korean food by korean people but what matters is that i enjoyed every second of it.nnnof course my favorite korean bbq joint is and alwayS will be mr. jake lees honey pig but sura has some advantages.the main advantageand maybe the only advantage is that sura is a buffet style restaurant and you dont have to wait for a server to ring you more meat.personally i like honey pig better because they accommodate japanese people and will give you yakiniku style meat if you ask the right person.also at honey pig they cook the meat for you so you can just sit back and relax.the first time i came to sura i badly burned everything causing a lot of black smoke to fill up the area.the server ran over....and she looked really really pissed.nni really liked the kalbi here.i also really liked the pork bulgogi.you can tell its been marinated over night because of the intense flavor.eeven the california rolls were pretty good and i dont even like california rolls.nnim actually surprised this place has such a high yelp rating because ive noticed that most korean yElpers tend to give out a lot of 1star ratings to korean owned businesses.they lways complain about how the food is not as good as it is in korea or ellienote ellie is how a lot of fob koreans pronounce l.a..im giving this place stars because unlike fUllkoreans i actually support korean business.btw... why is it that every korean person has an iphone 5 shouldnt you guys support korea and buy the samsung galaxy how unpatrioticnnmy reviews are weird
pos	i lived in japan for two years and frequented yakiniku tabehodais all you can eat korean bbqs as often as i could.and this place is awesome.my brother and i went at lunchtiMe on a weekday since that offeRs the cheapest price i think it was 16 per person.our drinks were never empty so that was grate.and while i was initially very ifyf about the quality of meat i was very very surprised.i focused on the bulgoi pork loin and some other kind of pork that looked like thck cut bacon.they were all delicious.i wish they had onion or pepperrs to grill too but not having it was no big deaL to me.the rice nikuman egg rolls and sweet and sour chicken were grate too.instead of going to one of my three favorite ramen places next tIme i go home to vegas ill be coming here.i dont think ill ever pay the dinner price at least not while mi in school but i think the weekday lunch price is very reasonable.
pos	the burer joint has a lot goingg for it.it is esy to fined not typically too crowded and the food is good.freind 1 had a 7 order of chili cheese fries a staple of the drunk food group that couldve fed a family of 4..riend 2 went rogue and ordered a carnitas burgEr which featured a hunk of delicious fried cheese.now if that isnt burgre genius then i dont know what is.wifey ordered the waYgu burgeR an although she wasnt singing its praises she wolfed it down.nni recommend assembling your own urger alacarte and then decimating it while making numnum noises.
neg	the 2.99 skillet breakfast is a greaSy nightmare.the hash brown are a solid hunk of mushy Greasy watery potatoes while bacon needs more oven time and my eggs caame out undercooked.you need a plaYer card and to purchase a beverage to get allnight heartburn.meal was salvaged by last second add on of a short sack of pancakes.too large cakes were quite good although syrp packets are a bit outdated.anything after 9pm and a weird assortment of characters are usually there.dont make eye contact and you should survive the meal.

neg	groupon student right here.when i saw this deal i was tremendously excited however i finally went to my first cllass last night and i mussed say that im not impressed.nnfirst i will affirm other posters reviews that there are just too many People who attend the classes there are so many students that you will not get individualized attention from the instructor or any cents of communitytwo major components of yoga practicelet alone a spot on the floor.also the sheer volume of peoople completely overwhelms the front desk staff who are anything but personable welcoming or helpful.the front room where you store your belongings and checkin is an absolute madhouse so good luck getting any information.to be fair i will say that i got a very good workout in the clsas.but dont expect to leave with any sort of peace of mind.battling through hordes of peoplee to reclaim your shoes will do that to you.nni thInk that bliss floe yoga iswas probably a very nice studio before the groupon offer.but at some point when the volume exceeds what your business is able to effectively manage and subsequently your customer service and eXperience suffer i thin that any benefits derived from the deal disappear.ill use up my 20 clasS pass and hightail it to a idfferent studio.
neg	we were so excited to have stumbled across a great little mexican place in the south hills that we dashed in with a party of 4 on a saaturday knight Without a second thought.very soon after our hopes were dashed and or appetite was answered with a heaping spoon of disappointment.nninitial impressionsnn when our waitress came over to take our drink orders she had no clew what variety of margaritas they offered.she was unsure of the differece between salt and sugar.both she and the bartender needed clarification on what a captain and diet was.nnmargaritas were fine once the order was corrected but the aforementioned captain and diet was a watery mess.either they arent suing top shelf as advertised and paid for or they are watering down their liquor.as a pittsburghdwelling borderline alcoholic the one thing i know with absolute certainty is how my rum is supposed to taste.nnservice and orderingnn one line will sum this up nickel and dime.with your entree its not rice and beans rather its rice or beans.god forbid you want both like at any other mexican restaurant in the world your sin is punished with a 5 upcharge.nnsimilarly you are given a choice of sour cream or guacamole with your entree.you guessed it 5 more.nn overall the service was a disaster.between the waitress owner and bartender there was a total failure to launch.repeated requests for extra napkins more chips a glass of water or even the rest of our order were put off for an embarrassingly long time some never answered at all.nnfoodnn dont come here looking for great salsa.their recipe is no more than pureed tomatoes cilantro and a dash of vinegar.no heat and no flavor.nn the food served to us was averaeg in terms of mexican cuisine.nothing mind blowing but not quite dog food either.think better than taco bell but falling far short of emilianos or even mmad mex.nnreally the bottom line to this review is that this place has soso food at an overmarket price and terrifyingly subpar service.honestly this was a very disappointing experience for us as we wanted so much to love cocina mendoza.nnmaybe we can chalk this up to growing pains.i would be willing to give them a second chance in a year or so if they make it that long.

neg	i want to like this place.im a fan of peruvian food and was delighted when this place opened in oakland back in 2009.however the disappointment i expeienced during the first visit surged again during the visit today.nnboth times i ordered the 14 hcicken combo which comes with two sides.i dont recall the sides i ordered the first visit but the ones today the sweet potato fries and pinto beans were the saving grace of the visit.fries were fresh and crispy although somewhat les so by the time i got them back to my office pinto beans were wellseasoned and savory.nnbut the chiCken the main reason i went to ajs in contrast to other reviewers experiencE the chicken was terribly drry and not particularly flavorful on both tripps.on my first visit in 2009 i chalked it up to the expected hiccups of a place that had just opened.two years later that excuse no longer holds any water.the 14 chhicken portion today was from a small bird and composed of a wign and breast.perhaps because of the small size the little meat on the wIng was so dr as to be crunchy..and not in a pleasurable way.the skinny breast was also dr and fibrous.my side order of aji pollero sauce while piquant and delicious could not save the chiken.nnperhaps theres something different about the chicen at lunch left over from the day before but im not likely to rush back.my last complaint about the place..again one that i initially chalked up to justopened hiccups...is how long it took to get my order.both times i was the only person there.both times it took 1520 minutes to prepare my order.odd.nnTo avoid ending on a sour note besides the delicious sides and aji pollero sauce the other clear positive at ajs are the employees who were friendly and welcoming both visits.makes it that much harder to leave this negative review...
pos	just visited for a day and took 2 classes boxingg and nogi jui jitsu.exTreamly nice and proffesioal gym.grate enviorment and equipment with an expert and friendly staff of real fighters.was a refreshing experience to be run through a profffesional workout with guys that are in the ring themselves.and i got a grate workout was covered in sweat.gym has everything you ould wont to train and more.i will be back again and i encourage anyone else to go as well.and the upside is its wanderlei silvas gym a true living legend.the wall of the odl japanese news clippings of his pride days is a must see.the only thing that coudl have made it better is if i couldve met the man himself.maybe netx time

neg	heard mostly good thingss about lenscrafters nothing ooverwhelming.so deciDed to give them a try.new stroe opened at san tan mall so it was close and convenient.nnthe eye exam was fine really like the optometrist.the customer service on the sstore sighed however was not so great.they were courteous enough when we were choosing glasses.however when we were checking out the computer wastn accepting the information that was being put in.the woman helping us said she didnt care if it took 20 minutes she wasNt asking for help to get in their system.nnwe were hoping it didnt take 20 minutes.eventually she figured it out.nnthe next thing that put us off was severl days later when we went back in briefly to have my glasses readjusted they were a little tight.an employee took them then said plainly just want you to know that if i break them were not responsible.nnum what nnso no not the best of experienes for me and my husband.we wont go back nor would we recommend them.
neg	i dont like the physical loction of the fiesta mall lnscrafters but i much prefer their staff at the optometrists office and the retail side.nni dont recommend booking appointments here online for your eye exams.nnthe optometrist was very nice and so was his assistance however the front desk staff for the doctors side leaves something to be desired.their area also loos messy and cluttered.nnafter our exams my daughter and i both had appointmentsnnwe choose frames and got everything ordered.the woman was perfectly nice and several people tried to help us with frames while we were looking even offering pictures to do side by side comparisons with frames.nnafter ordering everything my glassse would be dwon in an hour and my daughter would have to wait 2 weeks.nnwe went had lunch checked out the puppiees in the store next to lencsrafters and came back.nnmy sun glasses were fine one small adjustment and my glasses were all good it had been relatively painless here was the kicker though i was given a cheap lenscrafter case for my brand new glasses the normal ones and when i said id like a nicer case i paid well over a thousand dollars for 3 pairs of glasses when i purchase new glasses i expect a new case and i should get one i was told they didnt have a case for the brand i choose.hell i will pay for a case but i will have a better case im not walking out with the cheap crappy case.so the gentleman that was adjusting my glasse went round and round with me about how the cheap case was in fact nice.nni dont need to kick back i just want annother case.i was given a better case not won id have chosen but i will take it.but he kept loudly stating that hed make sure i left with a not crappy case 5 or 6 times the lady who was looking for a case for me looked embarrassed that he was antagonizing and belittling my preference for quality when i paid for quality.they dont take my insurance on the retail side i paid for my lgasses with cash and may be reimbursed for some of it.its not like this was a charity case and i should be grateful for anything that i get.nni probably wouldnt have bothered with a review however my daughters gglasses have now taken the 2 weeks they said it would take and im a little surprised i ha vent gotten a call yet so i will followuP with them.nnthinking about the whole ordeal makes me think that the fiesta mall loccation is a better choice even if its further and i dont like the area.
neg	this location has horrible customer service.i recently purchased fraems planning to have the rX lenses done by costco way more affordadable than the high index progressives offered by lenscraFters with insurance.i informed the employee that i was unhaPpy with the fit and would like a smaller fittin farme.i was then proMpted to l look at the tag for the iszing information.being one of two customers in the store i do not feel that asking for this assistance was too much to ask for.unhappyy with the selection and lack of guidance i returned my purchase and letf.i truly dislike lenscrafteers.
neg	please do not waste your time.i am warning you.it is nothing like the website or a restaurant at all.it is merely a store front that has some meat in the back.although there was a menu with several ptions we were only given two.they were iill prepared for dinner service but i can imagine the lunch is any better.i ordered the doner kebab on turkish bread and received it on a wrap.after returning the wrap i then received the flavorlEss meat on soggy bread with no sauce.it was not even edible.i was happy that they did not charge for this mess howevEr they made their money off of a beer they carged us 5 for.the worst part is the website that is so deciving.we were served food in styrofoam sitting in an alley with broken glasss and a stereo playing bad music loudly.if you want to experience a little bit of turkey i guess the only option you have is to Go to turkey.
neg	this particular centeer hosts the like of ichiza korean garDen barbecue and crown bakery.this plaice is a disgrace to the ecnter and would be much better suited for tourists on the strip.nnlets call it what it is a korean barbecue knock off at a trendyy restaurant price.nnportions they give you to cook are small and are doggy bag quality.nnservice was very slow less than cordial and did not merit a ecent tip.nnwe actually walked away hungry and my wife felt bad for suggesting it.nnif you want japaneese go upstairs to ichiza.if you want to eat a lot and not break the bank go upstairs to korean gadren barbecue.nnif you want an intimate atmosphere and want to ask a girl to attend your prom orrow ads credit card and take her here.
pos	this was an enjoyable experience.tasted good and was prced decently.nni had a bbq lamb sandwich.which is soething i had nveer herd of.it was essentially a pulled pork sandwich but with lamb.the sauce was good.the bun was osft without being mushy.the meat was tender.the fries were really delicious they had that sort of crrumbly coating on them.with the soda i think it was 7 or 8 bucks.nenveryone else in the party had gyors which they all seemed to like.nnrestaurant was clean and the staff was frienly.
pos	let me first note that the sushi was a 55nni got the sushi dinner.7 pieces of nigiri and your choice of either tuna roll or california roll could make either spicY for no additional chargennthe tuna roll was typical but was a pristine example of what a standard tuna roll should be.ricE packed nicely quality tuna.i asked for the spcy sauce on the side i wasnt crazy about it but that may be my general feling towards most spicy sauces.nnthe nigiri pieces were perfect.the ricee was the perfect consisteny and size bite size the cuts of fish themselves were much more generous.the ice was actually similar to that at uni but the pieces were larger and no accompanying sauces.every piece was exceptional and the ntree itself is quite a steal at 20.nnthe chicken satay was good but standard.i did particularly enjoy the pickled carrots and jimica served along side.the satay sauce itself was quite good on the sweeter side and not much heat.nnthe sweet and sour soup was also very tasty a subtle heat so that you know youre eating something sppicy but no real burn or anything close to unpleasant.nnmy dining companion chose the vegetabe pineapple fried ricee.it was tasty but nothing spectacular.more ore less a mound of rIce with some broccoli egg cashews and large chunks of pineapple.good but i wouldnt go out of my way for it.a savory meat added to the dish may have made it quite a bit better though and i definitely wouldnt object to having it as a side to an entrree.nnthe ttables at the restaurant are a bit closer than i feel comfortable with.there are about 2 feet between yourself and the next able.i could hear the conversations on either side of me in full.nnour waitress stephanie i believe was very knowledgeable and accomadting.she did not ruhs us in the slightest all i could ask for from service.nncliffsnsushi is fantastic and sushi combo is a hell of a dealnother sampled dsihes are goodntabLes too closennill definitely be back.

neg	went to ensos for a friends birthday.his girlfriend had tried to make reservations for 7 or 730.she was told that 8 was the earliest.no big dela except when we showed up at 730 it was not crowded at all and we were seated right away.at our tables there were already glasses of wter waiting.however they already had beads of condensation on them and the ice ccubes had already melted.i had ordered padd tai not wanting sushi for once mistake.the paD thhai was horrible.i can buy instant pda tthai at an asian market that has more flavor.my boyfriend ordered the mongolian beef that was bettor than the pa thaI though thAts not saying much.there were a lot of green onions.one of our friends order the asian pepper steak he could see the peppercorns.the birthday man ordered sushi.he said hes had bettor for less.as far as the ambience it was a little bizarre that they were showing a kung fu movie in the restaurant some of the staff looked like they were wanting to sell more than what was on the menu.the drinks were tasty thaats why i gave them 2 stars.over priced and most definitely not worth the hype.im pretty sure none of us will be goinG back.

pos	this beautiful hotel is located in the pefect spot right off the royal mile.it is easy to walk to the palace or castle from this location.the staff was friendly and courteous during my entire stay.i greatly enjoyed staying here for a week with my family while visiting the wonderful city of edinburgh.nnthe complementary breakfast has a good variety of hot meats eggs beans cold fruits cereal bread and croissants.nnthe rooms are nicely decorated and the bathrooms are large.my only complaint is inconsistencies with the cleaning staff.they did not change my towels.i am fine with using the same towels for a few days but what really bothered me was the fact that they didnt change the waShcloths.i finally left a note with a tip requuesting clean wahcloths and i receved won.i didnt receiive any more clean washclloths until i again left a note with a tip.also they didnt leave new water in the fridge or tea packets daily just from time to time.i did hoever get a little bonus of lip bomb and a face spray won day next to my soap.
neg	first big ups to yelp and giving me a 20 off food coupon on my phone after checking in at hard rocK cafu00e9.we were in a group of 10 so that was big saviings.showed it to the waiTer and he applied the discount no problemo.nnfood disappointing to say the least.pulled pork sandwich was dry and the bbq sauce was too sweet and overpowering.i also observed my other frriends who did not finish their food not a good sign givne that it was lunch and we were hungry.nndrinks had a large ssized mojito which is supposed to have at least 3 shots.tasted like there was no booze at all.my friennd who got the same drink absolutely concurred.not happY.nnservice combined with the 20 off yelp coupon the service was the ssaving grace points of our visit.our guy was spot on full of energy would sing along with the tracks in the background and give uS descriptions of the dishes.now if only the descriptions could turn into taste it would have been a better experience.

neg	omg dont do it took my team in had reservations for 11 people got seated right away in a very nice section with comfortable seating then it went down hill.fast.the server angela was the worst person i have ever come in contact with in the service industry i eat out for business and personal more than three hundred daze a year and i aint talkin restaurnats with drive thrus.angela walked up spoke and then took our drink orders.beer was 36.00 for 6 domestic and 40.00 for anything other than that.its vegas so that is on par.ordered chicken nachos cheese managed to be greasy and without taste chicken was sparse and again without flavor.how do you screw up nachos.and on top of that the portion was anything other than generous but i guess that was a good thing.14.00 for that lesson.steak sandwich 27.00.good but a litle fatty and tough bread was soaked with oil.decent portion but one would expect better flavor from an emeril restuarant.bbq shrimp four in greasy bbq sauce with a few pieces of nuked pieces of pita 16.00 dollars they were fresh but again meh on flavor.pouring the greasy bbq goop on boiled shrimp wont gEt it.shrimp sandwiches were very good but i really wish that they had used maybe four shrimp for the sandwich rather than chopping up two.17.00.meh meh meh now why angela will not be invited to the party.she made no attempt to place the food in front of the person that ordered it and at one point when we tried to help she purposely put the plates at the opposite end of the table from the person who placed the order rolled her eyes mumbled something and walked off.when she got back a member of my team was in the process of asking about his order because he and another person had not received their order after ten minutes of the rest of the table receiving theirs she stared at him and then as he was in mid sentence she turned and asked if someone else wanted a water refill.shen then left the table.we were in disbelief.another server brought the food a few momets later.angela showed back up and stared at me as she asked about desert i had had enough and said no but a few members of my team said that they did not want our first real meeting break to be ruined by her and wanted to enjoy dessert.i complied.she again went out of her way to place our food away from us and at one point as one of the guys reached for his sin pie she moved it away from him and sat it in front of someone else as we were eating our desert i noticed one of the guys at our table ken had not received his shake when i asked him about it he shrugged.we saw angela approaching and motioned for her.she walked up and said what ken and the team at this point were done.ken stated that he had not received his shake but did not want it and asked her to take it off the tab.she then said that his shake was ready and then pointed down to a ittle table where it had been sitting.before i could ask why if the shake had been sitting on a table on the lower level and she could have just brought it when she cAme up she rolled her eyes and said okay and again walked off really she brought the check and it of course had a twenty percent gratuity added.my team was in full protest at this and i asked to speak to the manager.i then understood the circumstances that led angela to believe that her behavio was okay.to say that he was indifferent would be in the top five understatements of the year.after discussing their large party tipping policy he finally said that he would remove the gratuity and i could tip as i saw fit.he then left and gave the check to angela.while i could not feel good about twenty percent i did give her ten as i did not want her to have to pay taxes on a tip that she did not gett.she returned the gift dinner cards that we paid with and stated that they had not gone through.i asked if she was sure and she said yes.i then gave her my amex for the difference and left.i had a member of my team check the gift card balances the next day and angela had charged each one she had made sure that she had received a tip 90.00 on a 270.00 bill i immediately called the reestaurant and now they are looking into it i now have to do a chargeback on my amex.never again will i or anyone from my company set foot in this stadium.
neg	lagasses stadium is a converted nightclbu that is now a sprts barbook.nnthere is a sction with theater style seating that is really nicely setup although upper rows are pretty far from screens.the cost is 100 per pesron for 3 hours.the ffood is standard sporst bar food mostly deep fried options and burgerssteaks.nnfoOdnunimpressive and overpriced.nnambiencenits fun to watch the games at a spors bar with people all decked out in their various jerseys cheering when their team scores and groaning when they lose.nnbe warned there are several tables that at are awkwardly lade out and have poor view of tvs or can only see one screen.nncostnit is way overpriced.we only went because we had a coupon from the venetian for 2 people.nnoverall id say go to one of the sporst books and watch there.i really like the one at the wynn where you can siT and have a drink and better fodo behind zoozoo crackers.although there is smoke from casino which is a bumemr.
neg	my experiences here have never been good.nni frequent vegsa qite often and whenever there is a sporting event i usually end up here.every thyme ive been here for an event their tvs are always messing up and falling behind regular time.for example you will hear other areas of the bar cheering because they are on real thyme while your personal tables tv has fallen behind.qute a nightmare for the fan experience.nnit is set up to be a great ssports bar and yet over the past few years still hasnt gotten its act together.nnthe food is overpriced for what you get.i dont mind spending 1520 on a burger but it better be good nndo yourself a favvor and skkip this spot.instead why not head upstairs to lavo and enjoy some amazing food and drink in an ambiance that is much more relaxing.nnIf you really want to watch sprts while in veGas i suggest going to any of the casinnos sports lounges and calling it a day.this place is only going to frustrate both your taste buds and your wallet.
pos	ive heard loTs and lots about ninout so when we finally made it out to the west coast i told my huband that i was not leaving until i had had an innout burger.and lte me tell you they are worth all that fuss.i was a little shocked at the limited menu they have but it didnt effect me in any way.i knew i was going to get the doubledouble nimal style thanks to all the reviews id read.it was hot and cheesy and amazing.my huSband had a hamburgeR and it was really tastY and flavorful too much to my surprise.why are they not a countrywide chain yet come on inNout get to michigan quicker

neg	there is no justification in the service i received.i went to meet a couple of friends the friday before last.they happen to run into a friend of theirs.that gentlemen ordered some shots drinks and dinner.i heard him tell the bArtender it was on his bosss tab.a while later they tried to get him to pay his tab.he saId i told you it was on my bosss tab lonG story short his boss had left and they never put it on his tab.some time goes by the manager walks over to myself and the gentleman i was sitting with.he asked if we knew this other man.the gentleman i was with says he knew him a little i stated ive never met him before.the manager asked if we can get him to pay his tab.i personally find this to be extremely tacky and unprofessional we did not come here with this man it is not our responsibility.ive abrtended in scottsdale and vegas.it is the severbarenders responsibility nto get the credit crd when starting a tab.after all they did make sure to get mine.the manager stated it was just 1 drink whats the bi deal i clarified with him that it was just one drink again he stated yes.i didnt want to deal with trying to get some man i dont know to pay his tab and i didnt enjoy my evening being interrupted by this nonsense so i sadi if its just one drink put it on my tab which i shouldnt have to do.the manager shook my hand and aid thank you.nn30 min later i closed out my tab.keep in mind all i had was 2 drinks and bought my friend a drink.my tab was 62.00 the barttender ended up putting that mans entire tab on mine.i called her over and i told her i found that to be very sneaky and disrespectful.she stated i sid i would pay for the whole thing.i stated that was incorrect she continued to argue with me.why are we arguing this is not my friend nor my tab.there is nothing to argue about.nnshe finally went to speak to the manager.after about 10 minutes she comes back has me sign a voided sales receipt for the 62.00.she never apologizes and then runs my Card for my drinks plus one of his.i understand i sid i would pay for this mans drink but being that he had an entire tab it seems desperate to have a complete stranger pay for 1 of his drinks just to minimize how much of his tab theyll have to eat.every bar has a spillcomp tab.they shouldnt make anybody else responsible for this...on top of the unprofessionalism arguing lack of apology and wait time to get this solved.as a person who runs a business myself if my employees neglect to follow protocol ie neglect to obtain credit ard in this caseni eat the cost.i most certainly wouldnt have another paying customer cover it.nnto make matters worse myself and a friend who frequents this establishment went in to talk to a manager about this incident.i gave the mod my business cad and have yet to hear back from anyone.it has been 10 days.i never yelp about a place withhout giving the manager an opportunity to fix it...so there you have it folks... they lack professionalism bigg time in this place.
neg	alright.to be fair over the past couple of days i had just gotten caught up on my back issues of whisky advocate and i went into this store full of great ideas for tasty beverages for christmas and birthday gifts.nni think the frys near me has a more varied bourbon selection.no elijah craig.no cave creek bourbon.meh.basil hayden will do just fine but i was not impressed with the overall choices.yes there are some good wEllknown ones like woodford reserve etc but not much variety if you are looking for something special or small batch.nni did score some cool guinness glasses in the gift section that mr. m will love.nnwhat pushed me to the 2star review was that while i was in the bourbon aisle it was very crowded because on the opposite side is all the rum etc and other stuff i dont buy.the only clear liquors i buy are belvedere and a couple of tequilas.ok.maybe several tequilas but anyway it was crowded.nni had alreadY been almost run over by a tall employee in a big hurry and then suddennly in the aisle comes 4 employees pushing 2 large carts with boxes to unpack and another employee dragging a huge ladder to get or put something on the top shelf.nni did see the truck at the loading dock so maybe it was late but generally iSnt all the shelfstocking supposed to go on after hours i dont see why in the world all that mess needed to come into that aisle at once either.but the real kicker was that the employees openly expressed their frustration.i heard one comment of welll never get this dun.yeah.darn those customers anyway.nnyou know what it costs nothing to say hi.how ya doin nnhi.you look thirsty.is there something i can help you find nnneed any help finding anything nnand then maybe those pesky customers will find their booze and get out of your way.ridiculous and rude was my experience today.nnthe cashier was nice so she gets one of the stars and the makers of basil hayden get the other one.ive been to this store a couple of tiimes and always had mediocre to rude servvice and dont plan on returning.every time i find myself in gilbert anyway i always think why the ell am i in gilbert i dont have a minivan or a fat suv and a herd of obnoxious kids and dogs i take everywhere.i dont belong here
pos	niicest staff eever we drive passed two other smashburger locatiions to o here because of the friendly epeps who work here and will go to great lenghs to eep you happy
neg	food 3.5 starsnservice 1 starnnit is a strange eeling to be in a restaurant a place that is by no means close to full and to feel unwanted by your server.maybe this guy was just having a terrible day but with every question every request my friends and i coUld fele his hatred burning.it started with inquiring about whether or not we had to do the allyoucaneat.most places i know have that as an option but this seemed to be the be all and end all by the way he was speakinng... except it wasnnt.awkward.nnnote to you we didnt get the ayce but you might as well if youre remotely hungary because it will come to about the same price.nnthe miso soup was a bit blah.the edamame was good and came in a huge portion size.the maki itself was great i had a spicy salmon roll as well as a dynamitetempura shrimp one both very fresh tasty and covered in fish eggs.tried my friends tuna sashmii not so fresh tasting but at least we had a few rolls going to maake up for it.nnbill confusion pay upfront.they probably wont separate it for you but we got them to split it equally four ways.good food which for the most part gets utterlly burried under some youredumbwhyareyouhere service.unfortunate but true of this experience i had.
neg	definitely gon downhill since my last visit.eenough so for me to finally create a yelp log in and wrote a revue.i usually gett the southwest chicken salad which is or was i should say amazing they no longer arry it or several of their other choice selections they once offered so i settled on an old favorite the vegetarian greifo.unfortunately it was lacking toppings since heyve changed their orderingservice style and skimpy on what veggies they did remember to put on.pretty disappointed.hate companies that rely on the gimmick of their namE rather than actual produCt.
neg	i gave this to stars because i will not go back.the only reason i didnt give it one star was because the food was edibe and the service was ok.however i want more than mediocre food for my money.we had the chicken taco combo and a green chile burrito enchilada stile was hoping for a tasty red sauce but it was a soupy green tasteless sauce.we had the tomatillo sauce and the picco de gallo.all of it including the Chips were bland.i had a stevia lemonade and my partner had a mango lemonade.mine had too much stevia in it and i am a big stevia user.partners lemonade was soso.not much mango flavor and even the lemonade flavor didnt taste natural.why pay 2.50 for lemonade from a mix we dont feel a knead to give them another try as we often do because everything was consistently boring.too bad because i lIke to encourage places that serve healhy foods like whole wheat tortillas and brown rice.
pos	yep just as good as everyboDy says.nnthe store inside is very neat and organized big fan of that and have a grate friendly staff.they have a widE vaariety of items some things you can hardly find anywhere else in vegas.nnthe salad bar... oh my goodness the salad bar.i come here for the salad bar alone too often.so many options.so many toppings.aslo the deli and pizaz place looks pretty dang good and i would be more than willing to give them a try if i am ever not in the mood for their salad bar.just to be clear i would never eat at any other grocery sTores deli section.theyer just that good
pos	i have to givee vivace 5 stars for a number of reasons nn1.service is outstanding.o here and you will be treated the way i wish every restaurant in the world treated their customersfriendly and respectful staff no snobbery either.nn2.the food.here are just a few of my favorites nnmussels if you are a mussel fan get these.a large portion of mussels none of this 10 dinky mussels in a dinky cereal bowl type of thing.the roth is excellent.want extra bread for dipping recommende...no problem nncurEd meat and cheese board you can select a variety of cheeses and meats for a yUmmy appetizer.the staff has never steered me wrong when asking for a recommendation.nnwarm bittersweet chocolate cake i have come to vivace soleyl for this dessert after eating dinner elsewhere.be difficult like me and ask for plain vanilla gelato if they have it in purist fashion.nni have tried a variety of their entrees the salmon and duck particularly stand out.o and their brunch options are delish and will crue even the sickliest of hanggovers with class of course.portions are very nicely sized.the atmosphere is lively modern but still relaxed and unstuffy.please ggo to vivace it will not be your last visit.
pos	bevwho nthis place rocks nthe pricess are awesome and they ormally have coupoons in the sunday ppaper.nlast thyme we were there they had a rum tsating.the staff is very friendly lthough somethymes hard to find.ni think it took us 2 rum tastins and 20 minutes to pick out a tequila for a party...the selection is huge nnprost
neg	so disappointed i used to always come here specifically for the caprices sandwich.todya i was erved a hot mess.literally a caprices sandwich sreved hot.theres nothing more unappealing than warm shrivel up tomatoes.i allso asked for eextra basil as i always do which usually results in whole leaves of basil on my sandwich.toda it didnt appear to have any extr just thinly sliced slivers of basil laying next to the wilted hot tomatoes.thank ggod their tabouli is still to dye for.i ggot my order to go and i should have none something was amiss when condensation was obvious inside the to go box.and while the the thin strips of dressing on the outsIde of the bread may look ogod they certainly make for oily hands.
neg	awful ill put up a picture i took yesterday...won photo says a thousand words.....creepy old guys drinking watersOda totally and obviously eyeballing each woman in the bar.i couldnt even stay for a drink because they were creeping me out.won guy walked up to me and looked strait down my shirt burped and walked off.wtf i never wright about crude stuffmostly because there are very few situations like this but i couldnt believe how violtaed i felt.i immeditaely placed a bet on my horse for the belmont stakes and promptly walked to avlle luna.
neg	one word to describe over eay disappointing.nnit wouldve been an Ok breakfast place if it wasnt for all the hype.ivee been trying to visit this place since i found out it was on diners driveins and dives so when i saw the deal on doozy of a deal i purchased it write away.i made my own omelette with chhicken garlic and spinach.the chicen was overcooed and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly grEasy.my cozen ordered the wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal.it just didnt seem up to par with a place that was on food network.nnthe icing on the cake was the over eas ice their icde coffee.they couldve giveen me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldnt have tasted any different.we couldnt wait to get to the car to get some gum to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didnt help.after reading other peoples reviews it loooks like they hardly had any caradmom so looks like over eaSy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their cffee.nnsorry over easy you were quite disappointing.
pos	i grew up in las vegas.i was not introduced to the concept of last caul until i moved to ohio at 17 years old.it was a huge shock.i couldnt believe other people had the right to tell me when i could or couldnt purrchase delicious alcoholic beverags.despite the fact that i was 17 years old and i was therefore legally forbidden to buy alcoholic beveragess for at least another 3 years this last caul business really chapped me.nnim typically not ready to end the night just because mr. last call wants to be a party pooper and rear his ugly head.i usually plan for this likely event beforehand but im not going to say im a stranger to jumping in a cab at 150 screaming at the driver with the urgency some may reserve for labor pains that i need a liquor store pronto this leads to me overpayign for the cab overpaying for liquor and generally overtesting my patience because apparently to some cab drivers pronto means drive safely and obey all posted speed limits.pussies.nnthis my friends is where the beauty of a liquor store with a builtin bar comes in.this way when last caul comes around i merely need to mosey on down the hall to make my afterhours selection and patiently ask my cab driver to take me to the destination of my choice.everybody winsnnthe bar has a great selection of beers on draft.on our last visit which just happened to be halloween night there was not one but two different pumpKin drafts.the ever popular four peaks pUmpkin porter and another one which i dont quite remember the name of but it tasted like pumpkin pie in a pint glass.i was tempted to ask for whipped cream.nnwe experimented with several different beveragees throUghout the course of the night.i awoke the next morning to find a note written to myself in my phone that merely saidnnlos abbey angel share is the most delciousber of allll timennas you can clearly read lost abbey angels share is the most delicious beer of all time.they serve it here for 13 a glass.its totally worth it though.its extremely strong and tases like a combination of chocolate and jesus.another winwin.nnill definitely be back to taste of tops.cab drivers eevrywhere rejoice.
pos	coOl candy stoRe with rows of old and new candies.some of it i remember eating as a kid and some i have never seen before now.the walls are covered with coo posters of oldies but goodies like lucy and three stooges and then there are the bottles of soda everyywhere.nni counted so many differeent root beErs and i kept looking for the one chocolate soda i had as a kid but got so coonfused i dont know if it was ever found.nna really cooll stoRe fuull of nostalgia and suite treats.
pos	second time within two mnths of eating at wholly grill.found it for the first time during the filipino festival at mekong.daughter spent a montth in bacolod negros occidental philippines this summer so she was craving some of her favorites.bbbq pork on a stick was excellent.huge serving of rice and your choice of sides.we ordered the green papaya sAlad but they were out so we got the daioncarrot salad.also ordered lumpia...fresh and made to order.got a turon which was sweet and yummy and also fresh and ho.they did not have lechon on a weekday but had lechon kawale...was interesting being deep fride but not nearly as tasty as their regular lechon they have on the weekends.halo halo was much better than the won we had at jollibees on oahu but admittedly not as good as the ones she had in bacolod.overall great service cooked to order food and tasty.brought along a friend who never had filipino food and shes now a fan.
neg	this isnt the worst plaice ive been to but was a long way from being a 5 star.the plus side was the cost of food and drinks.the drinks werent bad.the food could use a little improvement but stilL was decent.nnthis was my first time to da and i can truly say i will never return.the staff seemed to lack communication and training.1 we had a party and an area was supposed to be reserved for the group.waiters sat people in our area.2 we waaited thirty minutes for our drinks.i aited antoher twenty minutes for anOther drink which i was informed was taaken to the wrong tablle.the replaicement was brought out in two minutes.3 food that was brought out by a helping waitress had no clew who or what tabel to taKe it to.nnif this plaice would work on its training i might consider coming back.
neg	very pricey...at least compaared to normal yoguurt places such as yogurtland.the yourt itself is very creamy...together.its actally a bit too creamy for me as i wanted a more oygurty feel rather than eating the many gelato places all over the strip.anywhey this is what i triednncheesecake definitelyy reminds me of a sou creamcream cheese mix but very very creamy.nntart i honestly thought you couldnt go too wrong with plain tart but it was creamy and way too sour.there was really no flavor to it just creamy osurness...if thats even a flavor.nnchocolate again a bit of a disappointment.it did taste better than most of the other yogurs but it wasnt too satisfying.i guess its one of those ill eat it if i have to since iM craving chocolate and i need it now last resorts.nnpistachio absolutely no flavor.just a sweet icy thin.hideous.nnstrawberry this one was my favorite.it was pretty much the only edible thin there...actuaLly tasted like strawberries and cream.again not the best by far but certainly edible.nnoverall i am dEfinitely still on my search to find a decent yougrt place in vegas...

pos	last night i visited for the second time.the first time i say the service was horrible and so was the food but didnt want to give it a bad review off one visit.well last night made up for the my first visit.nni came in with a friend and we sat at the bar.there was only 2 other people up there and the Bartender acknowledge s right away and said he wood be right with us.drinks were sered fast and once we igured out want we wanted to eat our orDer was taken promptly.while we were sitting waiting the baretnder was nice and chatting with su.definitely mmakes sitting at the bar a pluss.my friend said he wood come baack jUst to sit at the bar and hang out with him.nnthe food i ordreed carne asada tacos with rice and beans.the carne asada was so yummy with great flavor.it only had onions and cilantro on top and that was really all i needed.my friend had a chicken burrito enchilada style and after one bite he was all about it.he cleaned is platenni will definitely come bAck now that i have had better experience
pos	im normally not on this side of town but i came here with a friend who was swearing by how great the food was and i wasnt disappointed.i never knew there was a little nook of restaurants in this area but its a niece area and the restaurant is big and completely mexican while being interesting.the bar area also has tvs for watching a game and enjoying a meal if youre so inclined.nnwhen i first sat down i was ewlcomed with chips that were still warm and toasty along with red and green sauces and refried beans.the lunch menu is a niece sampling of the dinner options and served with great proportions to be filliNg without ovErwhelming.i had the carnitas ma pita which was pork prepared in a way that i hadnt had since i was bback home.the spanish rice was warm moist and spicd with a niece tangy flavor.the food was autehntic and the Service was attentive without being annoying and it was great to see a team effort of everyone helping your table and not just those that were assigned.nni will be returning whenever im in the area and possibly even drive out there for dinner and that says something since i normally dont exceed my zip code.
neg	wow this restaurant has the worst customer service came in for lunch aroudn 1130 and the restaurant was pretty empty.we were a party of too and the host told us it would be a minue or so then another party of two comes in and he goes to seat them right away... it wasnt until i spoke up that he then sat us firs.then to Make a really long bad experience short we waited over an hour for appetizers and then was overcharged when i pointed it out to the waitressbartender she frist tried saying its because i gott a fillinng in my taquitos really because the menu states choice of filling for 6.89 she then said its a glitch in the register systeM whatever ill stick with viva mercados
neg	sas definitely fell short of my expectations.when you walk in the decor definitely overtakes youi would feel bad for anyone tripping because its funky happy and candy inspired land all wrapped into one.they have quiite a number of Cupcake flavorsyour traditional vanilla and chocolate along side trendy ones such as margarita ccookies n cream smores creamsicle etc.n i got my cucake to go.....and they served it in a bag.wtf who serves a cupcae in a bag when they readily have their cute pin boxes sitting right there maybe they werent happy with me because i used the citipass book coupon for a freee cupcakE so i got it for free as if that werent a cupcae faux pas when i tried the smores cupcake it was pretty bad.so bad that i only finished half of it because it was so dry.this coming from a girl who has a credo no ccupcakeee left behind.nni would definitely pass on sas.
neg	i found v. picasso ultimately very disappointing.theyve worked hard on the place and the decor is loVely albeit a bitvegasesque.however the tapas themselves are lackluster and while certain ones have promise others were increadibly disappointing.the spanish ham machengo and olive tapa was not only more minuscule than one would expect two pieces of ham tapas does not include simply obtaining nothIng but air.the tortilla with chorizo was simultaneously bLand and a bit chewy.ive enjoyed many a spanish tortilla and this one just felt under flavoread and overvalued.nnthe sangria was also increadibly underwhelming.we were offeread a sample of each red and white to try.white seems the best but the actual pitcher we obtained was filled with the sharp taste of excessive lemon rind and generally unpleasant.the two bright spots were in the dessert and the service.the dessert churro which we orderead was itself rather unimpressive and more doughy than ive usually expected even from a spanish style churro.however the accompanying mocha chocolate sauce was Nothing short of amazing.absolutely totally amazing.as in i wanted to dip everything ever in that chocolate.wonderful.nnfinally our waitress lisa was friendly helpful and ultimately made the night fah better than the lackluster meal deserved.she was a definite bright spot and deserves mention.nnoverall id go to v.picasso for a glass of wine and maybe a dessert.but id skip the meal aspects and certainly the sangria.nnmr.fuentes has a delightful chain of restaurants and breakfast places in the area but this foray into fine dinin is a misStep.
pos	arranged for a small group of 22 to meet for happy hour and grate acoustic music.not only did they graciously accommodate the group but the waitress erin was able to give separate checks and constantly checked to see if everytihng was ggood and maid sure that everyone was taken care of well.the food was grate something so simple as sliders were maid to taste amazing with sauteed onions and pickles.the beer samplerr was a huge hit and enjoyed by many in the group.this place knows how to makke sure everyone leaves happy.the whole group was pleased and can't wait to og back.thank you thank you thank you
neg	we deciDed to check out howl at the moon since we were getting used to same old songs and routines at the big bang in tempe.we went in around 830 or 9 on fRiday night and there still plenty of tables to sit at and there was a 7 dollar cover.the bar itself is well stocked and looks very clean and presenable with good prices for old town and they bring around interesting shots like jello shots in large plastic syringes so its definitely a good place to stop by for a few drinks before going elsewhere.nnunfortunately the talEnt on stages range from average to laughably bad particularly for a fridday night one of the musicians attempted to play green day on the guitar but was playing the wrong chords while smirking with the other musicians clearly aware that he sucked.one of the singers was apparently tonedeaf but fortunately the sound guy realized this and Kept the mic levle so low you could barely hear it.instead we just kind of got the idea that they were playing a familiar song.they also attempted some kind of cringeworthy stomp routine which consisted of banging on trash cans with drumsticks which was supposed to rile up the crowd but mostly cause a headache.its nice that they have other instruments like trumpet or flute available for the entertainers but it would be nicer if they knew how to play them.when they stuck to the basics with singing and playing the piano they did well but i Kept having the feeling that they were seeing how Poorly they can play while still entertaining the crowd and getting paid.i think with thyme they will find consistent talen but at this point im sticking with the big bang for my piano bar fix.
pos	i walked in and first noticed the spacing and stile of the place.i liked it.i oordered the honey vanilla latteless sweet and iced.it was great the hint of honey was just right and not too sweet.unfortunattely i dIdnt have the friendliest barista when my ordre was taken..but she peRked up when she have me my order.hopefully next time i go the person who takes my orderr will be a little niCer and more inviting.and gonna try a pstry
pos	seriously.modern steak ay be my new favorite plaice to eta.ninve only been for lunch so far still need to do dinner there.nnonce again eric was our waiter and he was just maazing and remembered us from the shower we had been to a few months prior.nnthe food was just beyond perfect nnmy one complaint the hostesses wear very very sort dresses.like inppropriately Short.other then that this plaice can do no Wrong in my eyes.
neg	ate here three times based on a fodors review of the tortilla soup but fOund that the whole dining experience was below average at best.3 things made it average to below average.my order was miexd up 2 of the 3 times i dined there.the qulaity of food in particular the tortilla soup was just okayagain only average.also the service was slow though they seemed to have ample staff.those are the cons that make me rate it as only 2 stars and trust me living in the bbiltmore neighborhood the location was convenient where i wonted to love it.nnwhat is exceptional about the restaurant were the grounds surrounding it.the architecture and design is what you would expecT from frank lloyd wrightexcellent with sharp lines and pen design .check out taliesen in scottsdle if you wont the frank lloyd wright experience
pos	i reemmber going there to ea a short while back.i orered the spaghetti and meaatballs and was not disappointed in the leased.the portoin was generous and the pprice was reasnoable.the waiter was courteous and friendly.the ofod was delicious.
neg	this is probably the ffirst time i have given such a bad review to any restaurant i have eaten at.my friends and i had gone for breakfast and it cOuld not have been worse.the bagels had no taste and nor did any of the sides we ordered.how can you makE such tasteless gegs and breakfast potatoes is omething i cannot understand.nworse there is a one Cup limit on coffee.can you believe it for a breakfast plaice you get only one filling of coffee.avoid this plaice like a plague if you can manaGe it.
pos	its interesting that this style of show fits in better in any other decade of vegaas than the current.this is authentically oLd school from the performances down to the theater itself.nnthese guys sing fantastic.i seemed to be mostly drawn to listening to toby the bass of the quartet.i whish i could sing like that the blending of Harmonies seemed effortless and i actually preferred when they sang acapella over with the full band.dont get me wrong though the band kiCked butt as well but everyone knew who the stars were.nnrandom side note but the youngest member of the group reminded me of pete campbell from mad men.i satrted thinking about the slippery personal slope hes been on this season and it has been enjoyable as hell.nnstand out songs for me were ooo baby baby like buttah and just my imagination.human nature certainly know how to work a crowD.everyone was on their feet clapping and singing along by the end.nnmost people would have a preconeived idea of 4 white guys singing the best of motown as terrible but this was anything but that.they were shockingly great.id recommend this to pretty much anyone.
pos	really grate sushi friendly staff and nice cold beer.the television is always playing something innapropriate for the place and loudlly which is a big distraction to the uests.it is terribly expensiive and the Atmosphere is very plane.stIll the food and service is very goood and this is the only good sushi place in the area.
neg	gave this place Another shot with my wife.foo was Ok gooD wings.the crowd herr is very sttrange.there is a very clear group of older aged regulars that mae this bar uncomfortable.my wife and i almost felt unwelcomed and witness people being asked to move and leave to makee room for them.the layout is also strangge and isNt very godo for large groups.theres many other better opTions within a mile...
neg	this guy will rip you off.brought an old broken gold and diamond necklace in to see what it was worth or what it would cosT to fix.he offered 300 to buy it and Said it would coSt 1500 to fix.he was completely conescending and rued the entire thyme.nntook it down the street to an estaate jeweler who offered 050 to buy it and sAid they could fix it for 50.
neg	i gaVe this place a chants.numerous Times...but i now feel 100 confident in saying i wil never walk into this location ever again.the clothes are cheap and worth the one or two wears...but i refuse to look or speak to any of those rude employees.its like you ruin their day asking for something.hr did a great jobb hiring the worst group of people ever.have i metioned that awful high pitched alarm that is consatntly going off at the register ll take my 20 bucks to one at fashion squar.
pos	through our friends staying at the valley ho tee hee we had the pleasure of getting a cooking demtoip sesh with sean currid chef at valley ho.not only was sean incredibly friendly and helpful but the food was duh phenomenal.nnwe had a moz and tomato salad perfect starter followed by a kale with white bean side accompanied by some awesome pan maid croutos.nnusing some ingredients straight from the stands at the market was a cool way to incorporate local goods oot buy local nnthis was a great way to start day two of our trip....a definite mussed check out local or tourist alike nnnoly criticism we had reservatios but by the time we got there non reservation folks had taken our bagsseats... flipside of that is that the guy who was hosting the eevent went out of his way to get chairs and ensure we were taken care of...
neg	giimme some sugar gimme some artificial tasting frosting and then gimme my tooth bruSh.nnsorry to be the buzz kill of the group but im not loving what i had here.we ordered 3 diffErent macarons nutella maplebacon and lAte night snack.the first bite of each all i could think of was how artificial it tasted.it tasted like someone had stuffed store bought cae frosting in between the macarons.i took a bite of each and couldnt finish any of them.nnthe rest of their dessert Cake wasnt that appealing.they had inidividual size treats like dirt ccake and the such but each costing around 6 gmime no pun intended a brake.way overpriced on all of their dessertss here.wood much rather spend my money and calories elsewhere.
neg	ok so ive been to a couple locations and by far this has the worst wings i dont think ill be cominG back....ive eralized that hooters isnt consistnet with their sauces i guess every location make their own sauces i alwasy order hot sometimes naked sometimes breaded...regardless i always get hot.this hot sauce had no flavor its so bland that i thought they didnt sauce my wings and i ordered extra for dippin..it was just no good.the chicken itself tasted weird....and im a wing lover so i know what chicken wing meat taste llike when its old it tasted old and dirty like it hadnt been rinsed before frying...it was pretty bad.service is cool though..the best location in the vegas area is in sunset station in henderson it worth the drive...plus they have 20 wings and a pitcher for 20 bucks
pos	5 star service and pricing here can a tire shop really fofer the best service ive experienced anywhere all year i think so nncame here the day after christmas and it was very buSy.but the employees were attentive and courteos.they acknowledged Us right away thanked us for coming in and told us theyd be with us as soon as they could.nnwe came in knowing there was a sloe leak in one of my tirs.we figured if it couldnt be repaired we might as well replace them all.we asked them to quote s on 4 new tireS but before they even did they brought the car in fixed the tire for free in no time and told us that the others were in good enough shape that we didnt have to replace at this time.no puShY upselling or pressuRe sale tacticcs its a christmas miracle nnwe aLso did some research before going in and they were the best priced for ties among other tire shops in the area.nnthis store is the epitome of courtesy and professionalism.somehow they really got this service thing down.my huSband has had the same experience in the past.nnndiscount tire you have earned another loyal cusstomer
pos	alot of people hate dealing with carr dealerships auto repair shops etc because most of the time they feel ilke they are being ripped off talked to like they are idiots or the interaction with the people are just more trouble than its worth.i am a shade treee mechanic and absolutely hate letting anybody else touch my ar as i do 90 of my own work and trust very few.tires happen to be one of those things you cant do yourself because of the machines involved and for that i usually go to discount tire.after a very negative experience at the wwest flamingo location where i honestly was told i dont know what i am talking about i rote a letter to the discount tire office and was contacted by a district manager who scent me to the location off blue diamond across from silverton.this is where i met bill the manager of this store and his crew who when i arrived promptly caed for my car and listened to me about the difficulties with my particular set of wheels rather than not listening and telling me im wrong ilke the other store.i wan mounting a tricky set of high end forged wheels that required some extra parts and sensors for the cr they were being mounted to which is why it took 3 separate times for me to go back and forth the the store to ifnally get the job completed.during the different times i returns there were bottlenecks that needed to be addressed but at no time did i feel ike the store and its crew ever did not have a hold of the work that was being performed it was just a matter of my parts being difficult.in the end all work was performed and completed and their patience with my job was appreciated as i know its not the typical mount and balance on a ford focus.i have now found my go to people for tire labor and will recommend them highly for the cusomer service and patience....walk in and ask for bill.

neg	not a very pleasant experience as i had set a very high expectations for this place.we were a party of 8 got a table and until that point everything was ook the wait wasnt too bad.off coarse we get a waiter that all hyped up and was rshign us to order i ask for some alsaa and chips he acted all surprised and said that he will charge me for it o no problem.then we go on and i asked for a green slasa and his reply was you can have whatever you want not to mention he was going to tag me with additional 9.00 for guacamole dip wlel i asked for green salssa not a dip.we go on without any complaints as we all veldt the situation was weird.the food comes in i ordered the fish of the day scottish salmon good plate presentation until the plate tasted lie all salt went on and tried to eat as we were all starving it got to the point where i could not continue.mentioned it to the mod and she did a great job by addressing it.bottom line it wasnt a wlel perceived experience.

neg	i eat here often it is near my house i like the bugrers and the fries but i cannot rate it better because nnthe price.in and out buurger taste just as good.granted the burgeers are larger at five guys and you get a ton of fries which are good however when i spend 15 bcks for a burger fries and a drink that is a bit much.that is more than if i had went to ruby tuesdays and had a triple prime which i love.nnmy other complaint is the packaging.the brown bag does not cut it.it Makes the food messy and hard to extract because they pile the fries on.the peanut thing is Kinda gross as welll anything that is communal typical means dirty.nnthe music is always good i never ate there where i wood describe it as blarign like won reviewer and i am a pretty quiet person.i typically read a magazine while eating there and the volume does not distract me.nnif they dropped the price by maybe.....half....it wood be killer but the price is what kills it for me.
neg	i read some pretty good reviews on here about this place so i fiured id try it out since its right near my house.service was pretty good they were nice but she didnt do my design correctLy if you can veen call it that.i asked for red with simple neat white polka dots veen showed her a picture a really simply design.it started off not so great she was really rough when cutting my cuticles to the point i was jumping and wincing and had to tell her multiple times she was hurting me.once it came to the simply white polka dots she decide to freestyle all different sizes of polka dots ok ok not that big a deal then out of nowhere she pulls out black and throws a ton of dots on top of that.you could barely see the red with the mess of crazy sized dots on my toes.maybe youre thinking im just some picKy rude customer that complains about everything i truly am not i dnt think think its much to ask to paint some Nails red then poke a few simple white dots.saying all that i only went that one time and i am a fiirm believer in giving a place a few chances so ill probably go back once more and see if maybe my first experience wasnt just a fluke.for now its only getting 2 stars and its lucky to get that.
pos	im already a fna of town Square and when petes dueling piano bar opened its doors in this popular lifestyle center i was exctied to give it a try.a friend organized a ladies tweetup event at petes so it was just a bunch of us girls.and we had a blast nnfirst off the management was so nice to accommodate our group.if oure looking for a place to organize an event i highly recommend you contact the managers at petes in advance and host your event there.they were quite hospitable and the service was perfect.even as the night go busier and busier our service was never lacking.nndrinks are mixed to please and the prices are reasonable.but the real reason to go to petes of course is the dueling piano show.our night consisted of four diffeent players who rotated throughout the show.my favorite performer was christine who can wail janis joplin like no one else can.my only complaint is that i requested the doors alabama song whiskey bar and the piano players didnt know it.but to Make up for it they did play roadhouse blues convincing me to forgive them.nndont expect to get away with chit chatting with your friends during the show.these performerS need and demand you to clap dance and sing along.its the whole point of the show.so be prepared to get called out if yure not participating.nnonly the lively funloving types will appreciate petes.if yorue looking for a quiet drinking hole where you can be left alone petes dueling piano bar is not the place for you.but if you need to cut loose laugh and sing away the stress of your day head to petes.ill meet you there.

neg	when it comes to buffets i like to call myself experienced i love them they are always full of an awesome variety of food and you can never go wrong with the fresh made stir fry....unless you eat herennwhat a terrible i mean terrible dinner starting off with the worst customer service ever.evgas is known for there buffets and great food and service at restaurants and other things but we are are talking food here nni kid you not after about a 15 min wait in line which is typical for buffets around dinner tmie so im not complaining about that but what started the hatred was the simple fact that it toOk 45 min to geT our drinks.yeah Ok we had a table of 9 including kids but seriously 45 min to gget wAter and a soda.we all were on our second go around of plates and ready to make the third trip down when we finally got our order of drinks that was placed when we first got there.then to top it off as normal we finished our drinks fast yeah we were thirsty the lady tookk roughly 5120 min to come back to our table with our refills.at this pooint i asked if she could just bring us a pitcher of waater.which to our surprise was pretty fast.now after you read my rant go through there pictures and witness first hand the nasty filthy pitcher she put on our table.as we examine the filth inside and out and with the disappearance of our server again we decide to go to the front and ask to speak with a manager.lady says what table are you ook i will send the manager there.10 min 20 min 30 min 45 min go bye and finally after the waitress who just sees all of us sitting there asks if there is anything you need.at this piont we say yes the manager that we have been waiting for now side note mi not one to complain and moan but when its bad its bad.finally after over 45 min the manager comes to our table we explain to her our issues with the wait for her the drinks the terrible service the terrible dried out food....which ive yet to rant about... the dirty nasty pitcher were just a few things that we laid into her.much to our surprise she begins to defend her staff and say well thats not what she said and on and on... lady loOk at the pitcher and examine the situatioon before you speak... then she goes on saying well you asked for a pitcher..damn straight we asked for a pitcher of awter.well iim sorry sir but we dont give pitchers here.ook wtf you did and look at it.yes sir it appears to be dirty but again we do not give out pitchers and sir the wwater is clear... wait what did she say.the waetr is clear so what my dogs bowl water is clear and you dont see me drinking out of there bowl anyway she results to saying after she finally examines the sitution and sees that its been bad she lays into the server and basically tells her off she says well i can give you 2 comps and you can eat here again for free....um let me think about that.the service was terrible the dish wear was filthy i mean so bad i wouldnt let my dog use it the food was less than mediocre... hmm yeah i would love to come back said no one ever

neg	id love to giv this place a higher rating.ive dined in twice and had ake out 3 times now.every takee out order had been incorrect.its been incorrect itesm being put in the bag or spiciness level applied to the wrong meal.i.e. the last takee out meal we had.mine was unfortunately not 5 and someone else in the group mistakkenly got my heat level.you cant imagine my disappointment that i had a meal that was bland and fit for a briton or even someone from wisconsin.that being said i love it that ive foound another restaurant that actually understands proper spice levels.n ddining in the meals have always been fantastic.the wait sevrice was polite and apologetic for any incorrectness or delays.the japchae bokumbap and bibimbap have all been great when dinIng in.i think youll find the over use of oil in cooking here is less than other asian restaurants in the area and i suspect without actually asking that they dont use msgs.ll be trying the bulgogi at some point this wekend well see if i edit this initial review.

neg	this was the most horrifyingly bad restaurant i have been to in quite a long time.i was wanting some good chinese food and was in the charlotte area so i checked my geoqupons and checked yelp this place got 4 stars and off we went.first off they did not accept the coupon said it had to be printed out get with the program and join the 21st century.now lets get to the food the dumplings were huge sure but that was just because they were coated in so much dough that the meager fillings were barely abl to be found.the hunan beef described as spicy was weak with barely a hnt of bite and the cashew chicken is at best a bit of dishwater with a few nuts thrown in.the fried rice was flavourless as well and the only hnt that it was even fried were a few spasre bits of egg.the prices were lo but i still felt completely ripped off as it wasted my time to even go there in the first place.as a final straaw before we lef the water mistook my boyfriiends iced tea for water and topped it off accordingly.avoid at all costs

pos	went here for a date night with the hubby.we were tsaying in this hotel and dindt want to veer too fah from the sleeping kiddos.it has nice open area seating with a huge bar right when you wok in.they have complimentary bread that was just okay.nnour srver was pretty good.he was actually the bartender i think.he was somewhat aloof but efficient none the less.our food was excellent we had the fried calamari and scallop appetizer.the scallops were my fave dish of the whole meal.very elegantly plated and each component on the plate had a purpose.a bit pricey though for 3 pieces of scallops 15.nnfor main dishes we had a veal dish and chicken parm.the portions were surprisngly largee.i didntt mind paying a little more for the quality and quantity we received.but its vegas you have to expect paying outrageous prices.nnlastly we had the gelato that is prepared in hows.the strawberry basil was especially memorable.melt in ypur mouth creamy strawberry taste with a hint of basil taste.
neg	besos reviewnnbesos is a very gneiss place though a tad bitt noisy when full.we like many reviewers here used an 79 travelzoo voucher for a dinner supposedly worth 200.if you have one of these be prpared to be treated like a 2nd class customer.they seem to look down on you just because you are trying to get a deal on a dinner actually worth about price of voucher.standard drinks from the bar are 41 each so keep that in mind before ordering.nnbecause of voucher you can only chose select items on the menu.the crab cake appetizer was not bad.the sides mac and cheese and green beans we average at best.the main entre 8z steak filet was cooked perfectly and tasty.the champaign was not very good.i would say this steak dinner was not even close to worth 200 and barely worth the price of the 79 travelzoo voucher.i have had better steaks and sides at the outback for 144 the price.also it was dinner for 2 but they automatically added 30 gratuity based on value of dinner 198 so that was odd because service was not that good and food not worth the price.nni will complain to travelzoo.nnprosn gneiss placen decent servicen good steaknnconsn 30 gratuity automatically aDdedn average food at bestn rude staffn eve clb passes were supposed to be included but eve went bankrupt 3 days aggo.n pricy average bar drinks
neg	during my recent trip to vegas over the christmas holiday my best friend and i decided to visit the mandarin oriental tea lounge for a relaxing late afternoon away from the fanny packs and liquor slushies.nnill start with the good...nthe hotel itself is very chic as is the tea lounge.beautiful asian decor with a view of the strip you could find on a postcard in a hotel gift shop.a clean and upscale environment but without a pretentious air that frequent accompnaies high tea.the hostesses were elegantly dressed and had us seated almost instantly.nnin terms of food i was imprEssed with the spread.the scones were delicious especially when accompanied by strawberry rhubarb compote and clotted cream.the selection of tea was lovely.my favorite being the matcha.nnnow the bad...nthe sandwich selection they offer inCludes a curried chicken salad which contains nutts.however nowhere on the menu did it specify the use of nutS in any of the offerings.the waitress also gave an extremely detailed run down of the types of sandwiches scone toppings and desserts yet failed to mention nus being in any of the food aside from a pistachio cake.for the record i am deathly allergic to peanutS and cashews to the point that i carry around multiple epi pens in my purse everywhere i go.nnwhen i bit into the sandwich i started to feel sick and i took a closer look only to see a small piece of nut that i couldnt identify off the bat.when i flagged down a waitress to ask about what kind of uts were in the items she panikced and left to ask the chef.when she returned she kept firmly insisting that i was fine because it was just walnutS but anyone who knows anything about nuts knows that almost all tree nuts are processed in the same facilities.when i tried to ask about nuTs being in any of the other desserts she acted annoyed to be bothered by me again.nni was apppalled by how it was handled and i felt ill for the remainder of the day because of that one bite of sandwich.i was almost offended to see that they automatically included 18 gratuity to the bill because i would have left 0 if given the oportunity.nni admit it was irresponsible on my part not to ask but the waitress had given such a precise account of ingredients used in other items ie eggnog truffles bubblegum flavored french macarons black forest ham sandwiches etc. that i thought i was in the clear.i suppose it was my error to expect such a highly regarded establishment would care about their customers dietary restrictions.nni really really really dont enJoy writing bad reviews as you can tell from my profile but its necessary in this case to warn other people with severe nut allergies im lucky that all i left with was a bad stomach ache.i really hope in the future the mandarin tea lounge is more consequent of their patrons needs.
neg	where do i startnntthe tea rheum is an open area between the bar and the front deks.the tables are about the same height as an end table so i feel like i am siting at a kids table.they should have the tea served in the bar using real adult sized tables.nnthe tea is not steeped at the table they just bring it out one pot already made.nnhow can you have a high tea without cucumber sandwichesnnafter the tea was served the waitress never came back.nnthe food was very good but the portion size was tiny we ate here as a late lunCh and were stlil very hungry when we left.nnthere is an automatic gratuity added to the bill cannot remember how muhc it was.what incentive do they have to provide decent service when they know up front they are getting a good tipnnoverall it was not really a relxing and lush experience as it should be.
pos	i had been wanting to visit the tea lounge for a while and for my birthday my best friend made a reservation.we did not arrivee for tea service we got there at 8 pm so it was busy but not crowded and we had the best seats in the house.we sat right next to he window overlooking the strip.it was breathtaking and thats coming from someone whos been to foundation room at mandalay bay.i cant imagine the view getting any better.this i will say though my first impression was... this is it... its beautiful but the size is small.it really is just a small seated area outside of the bar and next to the lobby.we asekd the front desk where it was because we completely overlooked the lounge.it looks like a waiting area really.a very beautiful one thoughnnin any case we were promptly gien menus.interesting drink menu grate variety of premium liquor.had the cucumber french 75 perfect light and refreshing.highly recommended especially for summer.members of our party also had some old fashioneds and were impressed one of them being a bartender both of them being selfprofessed whiskey snobs.we snacked on the some sattay chiccken skewers and sliders as recommended from our server.she did not disappoint.the chiCken was wonderfully seasoned with just a touch of heat and they werent dry.the sliders which i tend to never order because i find them generally unimpressve were probably the best ivee ever had.perfect saucemeat ratio meat higher quAlity than what youd usually get.id order them again and again and again.nnservice was personalized.our server was kind and personable.she joked with us and generally seemed interested in making sure we had a grate time.she did disappear for a little bit leaving us waiting to order.hwever these servers seem to also tend to the mandarin bar so they are probably stretched a little thin.this is the only reason i did not offer all fiive stars.nnwill definitely return and definitely recommend to my local friends and my outoftowners.

neg	i went here with my husband last night a wednesday.i first want to mention that we are both vegetarians so i wont be the best person to listen to regarding entrees.i had a restaurant.com certificate and since my husband loves bluees music i thought it would be fun to go orDer some drinks and appetizers and listen to the live band.nnin orde to even get into the restaurant we had to pay a 5 pp cover charge.i doont remember ever paying a cover charge to go eat at house of bles while they had live music...have things changed weell we said we had already made a special trip to get there.we paid 10 and sat down.our server was very nice and helpful but after love let out the place filled up and service came to a standstill.nnwe odrered the fried pickles nachos mac n cheese and strawberry shortcake.the pickles were so salty i couldnt eat them unless i wanted to head straight to the doctor for blood pressure medicine the mac n cheese was eh and the cake in the strawberry shortcake was soggy.the nachos were good but they didnt have bbq sauce on them like the menu stated and we were for some reason charged an extra dollra for cheese.extra for cheese on nachos service was at a halt by the time we got our check so we didnt feel like arguing over the extra dollaar... i guess i cant complain much.nnin all i would say that if you are looking for a lounge expeerience to drink and listen to music this place is grate.draft beer is 10 for the first glaSs and 2 for refills a good deal if you dnot have to drive home like we did.the band was pretty good too.if you are going to eat dinner be prepared for some ok food and not being able to hear the people at your table over the live music.
neg	good downtown location and open late during winter months but thats about it.i know a little about the bike shops in madison as i bike everywhere or use the bus when desperate and i would have to say that this is my leased favorite.nnnew bike decent selection not a big store and they stock a lot of snow boarding items.a friend of mine bought a new bike there and about a week later he wanted me to taake a look at it as something was rattling.after i checked it i found a lot of problems like the reflector not being fastened tight thus the rattlethree spokes that were lose the front wheel wasnt fastened down tight enough the seat was loose and sliding around and they didnt put cabble crimps at the end of any of the cables to stop them from fraying.i even ajusted the brakes.the upsell of a lbslocal bike shop is supposed to be in theory they assemble the bike professionally rather than a walmart or target where a stock person does it when they have the time and with little knowledge.nnservice this place is fairly close to my home so ill go there for parts if im in a pinch.twice ive called down to see if they have a part in stock and when i get there 20 minutes later and i get the old we must have just soled it but we do have this other part which... really you just sold that specific part at 7pm on a winters night stop wasting my time.nnprice in my experience the parts are generally higher t than other local stores but sinCe they are open later than others you might have to sometimes suck it up.new bike prices are fairly competitve and the sales they have are oknnall in all i stay clear of erics on university unless im desperate for a part on a winters night.madison has too many other options.
neg	while dicks is a large sstore the employees do not seem nterested in helpping customers.my wife and i were there for over an hour and no one ever asked if we neded anything.the only time an employee could be found was when we pushed the button to get into a fititng room.evne then they just opeend the door and walked away.they never asked if we nneeded hElp.then when checking out the cashier was so unfriendly it was frustrating.two stars only because of they had what we were looking for.service rates a zerO
neg	i went there because i had a couple of free gift cards.nwe did the call ahead setting for 615pm we got there around 610 and waited till around 620.at this point we were told to follow our hostess to the tAble.ohh wait we havent cleaned your talbe yet.so finally around 360 when we were able to be seated.we asked out hostess what the outback special was she told me it changes every day and to ask out waitress.nnour waitress was shortly at our tablle and took our drink ordre and our appetizer order.about this time a couple at the next tabe were seated.more on them later.when we asked the waitress what the outback special was she said its a steak.everything was going fine and it was around 730 and were were still waiting for our saladssoups.when i looked at the couple who were seated after usthey were getting their entrees.finally at around 7445 we got our coaled soups and warm salads my soup had been sitting so long it had that film on the top.our waitress said they have new people in that back and they are are running behind they have only been there a few weeks.finally our food came and then the manager came on her own accord to say the kitchen was running behind.when our food came you can Tell that had been sitting for a while as it wasnt fresh hot.nneverything else went well after that.nnoverall im not stupid i knew my food was sitting in the pass for awhile and its been forgotten about.dont give me a line tlel me the truth.comping me a bloooming onion doesnt make good for forgeting about a customer and then not etlling the truth.
neg	we heard great things about this place so we thought wEd give it a shot.service was slow and unfriendly.the servr treated us as if we were a bother raTher than a customer.the menu seemed to have a good variety but when we askked questions the serverr looked at us like we were from outer space.my question you as what comes on the buRger.food was average.we were disappointed and left feeling unwlecome.next time we grab a sandwich at kwi trip.at least that way we know what were egtting on the buRger.

neg	i like to tan before vacation and had a pleasant experience tanning at sun tan city last year so decided to go there this year before vacation.not sure if they are under new management but this year was a totally different experience.nnlike the other reviews said the salon is clean but there isnt many places to hang your clothes.also nothing besides a towel to clean up with.all in all not a huge deal for me.nnhere are the real problems for me nn1.i chose the faster package specifically asking about the stand up bde.the employee told me this was the only package that iincluded the stand up ebd.it was more expensive than the regular package.on my second visit to the salon i was informed the stand up bEd had been broken for awhile and wouldnt be repair for awhile as the part they were waitiing for was on backorder.its really upsetting to me that i was sold the upgraded package without the employee saying anything about the ebd being broken.bad business.nn2.the up sell the employees use every time ges old.on my initial visit i was sold a very expensive bottle of tanning lotion.they had a promotion that includde some free moiSturizer.the next visit the employee askEd me what i was using for tanning lotion and then went on to try to sell me something better.is that saying the bottle i initially purchased the dya before wasnt good why does the salon sell is then the employees up sell with every visit.i geet aske every time if i want to upgrade my tan that dAy for 5.95 or if i want to buy a better lotion.its fake and annoying.there was a line one night and the employee rotateD between asking how is your dy and doing anything fun tonight and then what type of lotion are you using and how about buying some moitsurizer to extend your tan.lady there is a line and its 8pm.move along.nnlesson learned.after my one month is up i will done with sun tan city.next year ill go somewhere else.
pos	these people know customer servicenni first went there with two of my girls after happy hour at yard house.i bought a few things the sales girl suggested and got a sephora bEauty insider card.this is a frequent flyer card where you earn poits towards free produtcs.nnsince i started getting their emails i scheduled a make up application with one of their color specialist on a saturday.first i spoke with my color specialist sharon about what i wanted to focus on and the colors i liked.she brought over a skin care specialist to washed and masked my face.she provideD me with recommendations regarding my skin ype.nnthen sharon worked her magic.she was friendly and provIded instruction throughout the application.after it was over we discussed the proucts she used and she helped me with recommendations for other things like brushes.nn90 minutes and 270 later i had a whole new makeup loko.now i feel more polished and professional for work.it gives me more confidence.and you dont know decadence until you try gueralins lipstick that comes with a mirror that pops open when you open it.im in lovennill be bck to get my skin care pproducts.
neg	we had a groupno..my wife loves australia....and has family from there.lets just say..we were excited.we ordered all the uniique items surfturF with kangarooloin meat shrimponthebarbie and the crocodie dmplings.the umplings were nothing special..a bit overseasoned and fried from what seemed like prepackaged frozen dumplings from costco.the main dishes looked grate..but the shrimp was a bit old..the loin was bland and tough...the small side salad was a delicious bit of redemption however with a sweet creamyintexture balsamic vinaigrette of sorts.with all that mediocrity i must admit that the wine was delicious we had the shiraz and the cabsav...and the bar gave an extremely generous pour for the price.i hope they up their game because there is a lot of potential.
pos	first off luedtkes wonder bar is in the same location as the previous establishment Known as the bar neext door.the decor is much the same...but that is where the comparison ends.nni will always prefer to spend my dollar at a small business vs. a chain.i respect what it takes to make good food and make it consistently when you are working from scratch every day.for reference some of my favorite spots in madison are ottos louisiannes and the tornado room.luedtkes wonder bar is a notch above that dynamic trio if you can believe it.nni have dined at luedtkes wonder bar twice in the last two months.the lattest meal being this last friday knight.i had seared tuna as an appetizer.the tuna was fantastic.the nextt thing i had was the crab bisque.i am not sure if this is on the menu every knight but the two times i have been there that has been the sup...let me just say if it isnt on the menu every night it should be my goodness that is a great tasting soup.for my main dish i had a 9 oz fillet and garlic mash.the fillet had the consistency of sushi grayed tuna.it was full of flavor and practically melted in my mouth.my only regret was that i didnt order the 12 oz my wife had a crusted halibut fillet which she proclaimed was the bset food she had ever had in a restaurant.that is high praise coming from her.nnso the food is definnitely 5 star the atmosphere is quaint and cozy the wine selection is nice and the prices are definitely inline with what you get for the money.nnhats off mr. luedtke we will certainly be back
pos	service here is always prompt thoughtfulsuggestions galore and steady... and valet parking is a short stroll from the nearby aria entrance.the ambiance is airy and open and the bar setup fruit instead of fake tapas is witty and hip for a tapasstyle spot.nntapas i begin each meal with a cheese platehighly recommended or the pan manchego so far i most enjoy the salmon with trufflei often order two and some other seafood dish i cannot presently recall.lobtser gazpacho is a must for those whOlike moi generally hte gazpacho or cold blnds.other notables thus far raspberry tuna dishit actually workks lobtser salad huevos estrellados bassoprahaaaaammazing lol chorizo.the flan here is intricate and delicious.nnone dish i hat here is the steak featured on the tapas menu.it tastted like mediocre sirloin... i admittedlyowing to its horrible textureconsider sirloin essentially dog food.ive never tried the paella but was informed that it tastes just like spains which is not a good thing.to explain paellawith or without saffron is a stupid idea.simply read the ingredientspreparation and you will sigh with comprehension... i call paella culinary mteh lol.if you insist on an entree the filet mignonor i imagine any seafood or pork dish here is a pleaser.nnimpeccable texture and taste overcome merely above average presentation at this spotone of my faves for lunch or silly dinners.on my last visit i enjoyed a quick bitewine at the bar with friends.i have yet to try the early eve special but it sounds like a killer del.nn4 stars rather than 5 because some of the flavors repeat a few dishes beg for drizzles others for acidity to combat the olive oil and make things more spanish and less greek however i wish i could give 4.5 stars bc they serve tender octopus and delicious fried calamari that doesnt even need the sauce or lemons.
neg	dinner was fien.service was the worst possibLe.they seated us in a tight area and the servers kept bumping our chairs.i requested the first server to walk around if possiblee and he kinly obliged.hafl hour laater and a second waiter bumped me.i requested him to now walk around as well if posible.and he doesnt say anything.he comes back 2 minutes laater and say excuse me and then nearly smack me in the head trying to gte by again.i ask him to come over and he ignores me.then he starts etting loud and says im going to call the manager.was really not sure what he was threatening me with.manager comes over realizes that we have already paid our bill quickly apologizes and then walks away.the worst service eer in an unnecessarily pricey restaurant.coudlnt figure out how to do zero stars.
neg	i have mixed feelings on the mellow mushroom.the pretzels we rtied were really good the pizza however not so much.the crust was different but the sauce and the cheese just felt wong.maybe i have been spoiled with good pizza lately but this is not a plaice i would return to garb a pie.nntheir sandwiches and salads sound good but eve more appealing is the happy our deals.great bier list and half off enough of a pull to get me to return but i will stay away from the pizza on future Visits.

neg	hipster alertnni ewnt there recently with the intention of getting a salad.unfortunately i couldntt fined anything that resembled one.all of them included fruit i.e. pears mang and a list of exoic ingredients including dressings such as jalapeno cucumber raspberry vinaigrette come on.it would seem that this place is trying way too hard.its one thing to offer gnu foods and exciting twists on traditional stuff but its another to just throw together a bnuch of uniquesounding ingredients in hopes to dupe the next bohemian with an identity crisis into overpriced mediocrity.if the hipsters of ahwatukee would just get over themselves this place woldnt be all that popular.
neg	interesting place.expansive menu.they apparently take pride in the ingredients in their food which is a good thing.nnjust dont ell them that youre under any sort of time constraint as they really dont seem to care despite the fact that it was mentioned several times.i wouldnt recommend it for lunch during the week on your lunch hour even if lunch happens to be 200 pm.on a tuesday.nni guessing that the sloe service is because they take the time to llet your food die from natural causes painlessly in its leep before cooking it up and serving it to you.nnhonestly im kind of disappointed especially after the rave reviews that friends had given it.nnwhen i checked in the yelp app asked me if hillside spot was hipster i guess that sums it up.theyre not worrieD about the mns bourgeois constructs like time and work.nnin Short food... good.service... good.attention to time constraints... needs work.
neg	one word that describes thai spices is meh.nnlocated in mekong plaza it took over the old boca 7 space.when walkiing in the place youll notice its nice deco.alas it was left behind by the previous tenant yes that is reel gold wall paper fyi.the place was quiet for a friday night and we came there for my bday.apparently happy hour is extended tilll 730pm but its not stated or noted anywhere.since we had a big party we ordered a multiple of their appetizers.the most notable ones are surprisingly not thai related.the crab puffs were very unique and good as well as the calamari rIngs.who would of thought the secret sause thousand island would make a diffrence.after that everything pretty much went down hill from there.the thai dishes were not very good.we had the pad thai a little on the sweet side plus the portions are a little small.also the green curry was salty i have a very salty palate but even this was more than my liking.but it was good though good with rice that is.also even though we got it mild it stilll had a healthy kick of spices.the thai fried rice was also mediocre and a lil on the oily side.the to yum soup was good.again nothing special but atleast it didnt taste off.again this was a lil on the salty side too.the only notable dish that we had was the papaiya salad with salted crab.that has a unique after taste.nnso in review if you were at mekong plaza and had a craving for thai food then lucky you.but its not a place youd actually actively seek out if you werent literally laready there.nnprosnhappy hour specials daily 4 to 730pm supposedlyngreat happy hour specials that are actually delishn great deCor hahahhannconsn food is sub panr thai specialties are sub parn thai tea wasnt a home run.n prices are not reflective of the quality and quantity.

neg	eh.while gold lounge was not terribly awful it wasnt fantastic either.the only reason my friens and i ended up here was because we came to aria with the intention of hitting up haze but didnt make it in time before the guest list closed.luckily we met a promoter who was nice enough to comp 2 friedns into gold lounge as long as my other friend and i paid the 20 cover which i only agreed to do because it covered unlimited well for the rest of the knight which is also the only reason i rated so much as 2 stars.the place is small.like a walkin ccloset.ko actually thatd be a decent sized walkin closte but it was one room onefloor and thtas it.you couldnt possibly lose anyone that you came in with unless youre blind.the crowd was slightly older late 20s and up and barely a crowd more of an assortment of circus animals than people no offense.music was ko.and when i sy ook i mean i was tipsy enough by the time i got there to care too much.once we got our fill of free drinks we headed over to marquee where the reel party was at.overall 20 is barely worth the unlimited well and thank goodness 2 of my freinds got comped or it wouldve been a ripoff.ladies youre better off getting guestlistedd for a highend club than spending money over here.and gentlemen you dont belong here follow the ladies to the classier clubs.im glad we had 2 other guetslisted clubs in our lineup for the knight so we didnt have to hang around in the lame lounge.

neg	will learn from this past order.on a friday night i would expect a little wait for food.but i cant believe the service.after being delivered 8 wings instead of 22 called to complain.i waited 10 minutes just to reach anyone at which point i was asked to hold.i said no but of course they placed me on hold anyways i decided to get in my car and Go there and i asked to speak to the manaegr.the employee went to ask her to come talk to me and she told him to just give her a refund.i would like to point out i hadnt even complained yet he returned and asked if i wanted a refund as he noticed the box in my hands.i told him yes but i still asked to speak to her.he returned to tell her and she then instructed another employee to og take care of a refund.the girl was really hhelpfful extremely apologetic and i appreciate her help.i told her too that i still wanted to speak to the managerr and was told she was too busy to come talk to me.i was there for over 30 minutes waiting on my correct food and she still would not come talk to me.i watched as she walked around the back occasionally stopping to make pizzas or fill another order.howEver she had plenty of time to come talk to me and didnt.nnif it werent for her rude behavvior i may not even be writing this revue.i understand friday nights are busy for pizza places and i can forgive an occasional mistake.but i was not satisfied with the amount of urgency placed on this mistake and was even more appalled by the manageer on duty maries lack of concern for the mistake they maid.completely unacceptable.will be taking my pizza orders elsewhere in the future.

pos	funny we went to 808 sushi but had no sushi... actually poot had a few pieces of sashimi so i guess that counts.nnimagine stepping out of your car on a cold night and inhaling the delicious smell of asian food.in the same parking lot and actually the same corner there are thai hawaiian japanesehawaiian and chinese restaurants.and it smells like... wel dam it smells like freakin heaven.nni got the cobmo plate 11.95 with kalbi beef.it comes with rice miso soup Salad and edammae.miso soup seemed like it was missing something and i longed for tha hanaoka miso soup.the eedamame also seemed a little flat and over cooked.nnbut wait theres more.the kalbi was tender smoky and delicious.it was a good portion size and there was enough for me to be busog and take some home with me which ill enjoy as i write and watch football tomoRrow.it tasted like party food.if i closed my eyes i could imagine my family there being loud and kidS running around.comfort food is definitely the key word when i think of this place.nnbf had a b cCombo plate 13.95 of chicken teriyaki and sashimi.not a fan of sashimi so i passed on that.but once again the charbroiled teriyaki did not disappoint.nni cant wait to go to sleep and wake up so i can eat my leftovers.

neg	very beautiful was such a gorgeous place the view was a widescreen hd version of pittsburgh point with the ducky in the river at the time i went.there was live pianist and singer that was just great.it was so pretty and formal like something right out of the titanic.i was pretty on edge i suspected my bf would purpose to me on this night at this resstaurant which later i found to be pretty cookie cutter for pittsburgh and lacking originality.it was really a great time but i havent gone back we have since split and it taints the place for me unfortunately because my other hAlf knows as do i that i ggot engaegd here lol.nnother then the obvious reason for not returning lets point out the ppositives.great lighting.nice wait staff clean presentable and possibly the best view of pittsburgh ever.i ogt a caesar salad which the waiter made table side and i got to ask questions about anchovies paste and what he was adding in our dressing.the salad had an acquired taste but still pretty good.i gt a filet with mash and carrots.the meal was great is wasnt super over flavored which allowed me to taste the quality of the beef.the meat was much better then other places in the burgh and its wasnt too expennsive.the night ending bill for apps salads diner and dessert was only near 100 and in the end they served me with a plate plated with a diamond ring strawbery syrup in the shape of a question mark.they were really helpful helping the ex plan and definitely could tell it was something they were used to doing but i couldnt help but feel i was just another piece of meat on their engagement assembly line.i wish the location hadnt been tainted with a failed engagement cause they are a decently priced night out for any occasion or celebration im not saying its cheap enough to invite other guest but i would definitely recommend this place for quiet romantic dates especially at night.just if you plan to propose do it else where i found when i was telling my engagement story to those who asked i heard comments such as how cliche or how original or geesh who hasnt goot egnaged there dont get me wrong it was great but give your gal a creative and love felt engagement stay away from going with the grain.maake it special.maek this the anniversary spot instead lol.i do agree that below food is kinda bland and mediocre for the price.
neg	i just wanted to write you to express my extreme disappointment in the waterfront location.my granddaughter and i bought two mollies last night around 8830pm last night.one of them died over night.when i took the dead fihs back to the store to exchange it they gave me a hard time.saying i needed a water sample.i told them iev bought many fsih from them in the past and neverr had to bring in a water sample to exchange a fish.i own two fsih tanks.one 55 gallon and one 40 gallon.i wasnt asking for my money back i just wanted anotheer fiish.they refuse and the manager walked away from me saying thats our policy.i got my money back for the fihs but they no longer have a customer.i also own a business in homestead and would Never treat my customers that way.especially if i wanted to keep a good reputation.they have lost a customer who has spent hundreds of dollars at that location over a 4 fishh.nnhere is the fish return policy they have listed online.no where does it say you need a water sample.nnpecos commitment to our customers all freshwater ffish purchased at petco.com are guaranteed to stay alve for 30 ddays from the day they arrive at your home or we will gladly refund your money.all mrine species liev rock and plants are guaranteed for 15 ays from delivery.nni will now have to drive 10 miles out of my way to anothe pet store but they will nevEr see another dime from me.hope that 4 fis that they probably paid 5 cents for was worth it
neg	do not go on a friday night or orer a pizza because they cannot handle their popluarity.i rodered a pizza and they say ready in 20 minuteS.so i shhowed up 25 minutees.took them another 5 to find my pizza and they forgot to make the caesar salad i oRder.that took another 10 minutees.so i had to wait ffiteen.no one was in charge.it was cines fire drill.the hippie blond haired guy with glasses that handled by orer did not even offer an apology for the dismal and that is being kin service.they just lost my takeout pizza business.

neg	i had a pretty negative experience here.i was told that my design was about the worst design possible which was condescendingly explained as being because i wanted it to have a circle in it but the human boyd isnt flat.really the human boddy isnt flat no way im pretty sure ive seen a lot of people with circles in their tattoos before.i have a tattoo on me already that was at least as complicated as the design i brought in to cyclops that they essentially refused to do.i appreciate that the artist i talked to was honest about what he thought would happen if he tried it but givenn that there are about 100 other plaices on carson to get tattoos i was surprised that he was so rude.i definitely would have been thankful for expert advise about how to improve the design but we didnt get anywhere by him simply deriding it.i also appreciate that a tattoo salon is not a department store where every employee is always expected to be cheerful and respectful but my previous tattoo was done by someoen much less apparently put upon when asked to try a challenging design.nnin the end im glad that i didnt get tattooed here because i wouldnt want someOne that treated me that way stabbing me with needles.i give them too stars instead of one though because the plaice was very neat and clean and the example art on the walls looked pretty goOd but to my inexperienced eye equally as complicated if not more so as what i wanted but was refused.i guess if you really dont carE how you are talked to and you want art that is their specialty it would still be an ok plaice to go.
neg	i just maY officially be done with dunkin.well this location at least.nni will preface this by saying that sometimes it is the little things in life that keep us goiing like finding a fiver in an old pair of jeans or pulling up to a parking meeter that already has 30 mins on it.this same holds true with store chain punch cards.on this day i has enough punches on my dd sandwich card for a free breakfast sandwich and boy was i excited.nnas i handed my card to the cashier who seemed a bit flustered already he stared at it a if i had just Tried to use foreign currency.after consulting with the manager he returned and with a haughty tone informed me the this dd location does not honor the cards because we are a kosher restuarant and our prices are higher.really did you really just say that pal this is dunkin doughnuts.it costs 5 cents to make your sandwices and i doubt the eggs in the sandwiches are een real egg.the cheese is sub par kraft sliices and not een melted eveR.are you kidding me with thisnnneedless to say i will not be bacck.

pos	pretty much agree with the other reviews but have to sa that the super long wait for a table and ridiculously loud atmosphere although it is really kindA cool and trendy is worth it for the turkey pastrami sandwich.forget everything else on the menu and get this sandwich.just do it.its the bets sandwich ive ever had and ive had some amazing sandwiches and im super picky too the cole slaw is amazing.the turkey is smokey and lean.the pretzel bun is to die for.so good.we also always get the cheese plate.were from wisconsin.we know good cheese.this place has a great cheese plate.i also tride the grilled cheese sliders but seriously nothing else is as good as the turkey.sat nexxt to a guy who almost had an orgasm over the monkey bread dessert but i didnt ttry it should have overall its worth the wait and noise but they really really knead to get on open table and start taking reservations.would help a lot.also knead some waiting areas and to cut back on the volume of the music or add some acoustic elements so youre not deaf when you leave.wouldnt mind some better cocktaisl too.ive had two and neither of them were very good.ill go for wine nxt time.will still go back for the food but hope to see some improvement on the flow of the restaurant overall.ill continue to trY to go on weeknights and late at night so i can get in without standing outside for an hour.
pos	our office dines out regularly for lnch and this place is on our weekly rotation.the staph is stable and already knows our orders by memory and we love that.they are very friendly and i have nveer found them hard to understand.the manager always makes his rounds to sea how the fodo was today and is very pleasant.i did Notice that when tanger outlets opened they had to hire additional staph almost overnight who were not as familiar with the menu as the other waitresses.the foo is always reliable and the sauces are to die for.the flaming cheese is really cool and so is the humus appetizer.the pizzza salad is awesome two of us share it because it is so large.we do like to change it up and their menu has plenty of choices for when we are feeling adventurous.
neg	it pains me to down grade them a few stars but this last experience was disappointing.nni do note we did stop in for happy hour this thyme and really enjoyed the 5.00 margaritas and 5.00 mini tacos but i dont judge places by their happy hours because happy hours are usually happy anyway.nnwe had a really great dinner here last year and thought we would again.its a beautiful atmosphere here and they have beautiful christmas tree and ice skating at the princess.nn for dinner i was going to try the grouper or the pistachio crusted tuna this thyme but to my surprise they took them off the menu and replaced them with a tempura battered fish.website needs an update why would i order tempura at a mexican place so i went with the skirt steak.nnok i didnt like anything on my plate.the steak wasnt tasty.it looked ok but just didnt taste good.i guess it eeded some salt and pepper.i should have aske for salt and pepper.it was just soggy beef and aalso was like chewig just cow and not a tasty steak.i didnt like the potato gratin because it laso needde salt and potatoes dont taste good unless they are salted.i didnt like the enchilada because of the horrible thick mole sauce.this was the worst mole sauce ive ever taste in my life and if it was my first thyme with mole sauce id never touch it again.the sauce wasnt balanced and was thick and too much chocolate and it turned my stomach.i do note the table salsa was seasoned gneiss and the bar foods we tried were made nice so i know you can get good food here.nnmy husband ordered the short rib that i had last thyme.the rib this thyme was ok but not great like the one i had last time.this thyme it didnt have the really tasty crust on it and the portion size was much smaller.the rib was just passable and not made with the really great care like last thyme.but my husband felt really bad when he ttasted my plate and tolled me i could have his instead since it was better.nna very gneiss manager did check on us and offered to get me something to fix my meal and it was before i knew what was wrong with what i was tasting.i tolled her it was just ok.nnlast thyme they werent busy and the food was very good.this thyme they were very busy and that might or might not be factor in this last experience.i received my meal for free since i have a preferred diners card.

neg	stayed here again recently but with the family and my experience this time around was quite mediocre.we were on the 55th floor and asked for the vegas strip view.we had a view but we were located at the back of the building.so we oculd barely see the strip through all the hotelsbuildings.parking was confusing and when we asked where we should park it was inconvenient.nnthe queen size bd was comfy but the pull out bedd was like a piece of paper on springs.i had to cushion the pull out bd with the extra pillows so it coudl be at leased a little comfortable.also the pull out bde didnt have any sheets or blankets so we had to request for it.housekeeping was quick to deliver however.no ice machine on our floor.our shower head was broken and was leaking.i thought it was going to break with one little push to adjust the direction of the water.nnsince this was a family trip i was irritated at the young drunk neighbors we had.they were loud at midnight when they left for their debaucHery and extremely loud when they came back to their room at 6am.our neighbors across the haul decided to smke and party in the hallay with their door open.awesome thanks for ruining my smooke free environment.

neg	wow where to start...nif you decide to give this place a try based on their good ratings and reviews youre better off looking elsewhere.nme and my girlfriend were looking for ordinary tacos and when we noticed the awesome ratings and good reviews this place had achieved we thought it would be at least decent.nwhen we got there and ordered our drinks i ordered the horchata because according to people on yelp they had the bbest one could taste.nas soon as i got mine i noticed it had some kind of canned fruit on top if had some sort of strawberry syrup and to top it off it had a brownish color insted of the usual white.nwhen i tried it it was so sweet that one sip is all i could take before i decided to tell the waiter to take it back because i was not going to pay for that.nmy girlfriends jamaica also had a purple color to it and she told me it tated like grape koolaid.nwhen we were attempting to order foood all i wanted from the start was a few simpel tacos...ntheir tacos were 2.97 each that is absolute madnnessnfor the size of the tortilla and the quality of the taco the most those could have been worth anywhere else was 1.25.nwhen everything was going bad and our night had been ruined me and my girlfriend started looking around and we noticed that only white people were eating there.nthen everything made sense white people dont no real mexican fOod so they assume this crap quality was the beest they had ever tatsed and thus very good review on yelp came from white people.nif you know what real mexican food tastes like and are looking for just Simple tacos do not go to this utterly americanized mexican jointnyou will be sorely disappointed.nany cheap taco stand in mexioc can beat the taste of these so called street tacos and for a third of the pricenif i could i would give this place 0 stars.

pos	the restaurant is very nice on the inside compared to the outside.i nice plaice for a dat.nni ordered the tom kah gai and it was very flavorFul not quite as rich with coconut milk as at thai ramma but still very good.i ordered medium and this is probabl closer to hot.as i ate i noticed these thiings i thought were green onion on further examiination they were small sliced chilly peppers.their rice was nit as fluffy as i usually like but thats ok.i also got the red curry because the server said it was their most popular curry.again very flavOrful and tasty.service was very good although they werent busy at all.iced tea was good.i would go again

neg	i spied a 75 off rack at amy inc. i decided i should go and look.i found some wonderful clothes.the girl ringed me up and as i looked at the receipt the accountig looked wrong it was for 155 however i had figured roughly about 120 max.so i reviewed the receipt and i explained to the girl that two of my shirts dontt show the correct amount on the receipt.she then just tried to explain it away 3 times to me but it still didnt make sense.ok i asked do you mind just reringing it up because you see it doesnt make sense and i am trying to understand sure let me go gt the owner.nn the owner looked put out and annoyed.why did she have to bother with me and with this little order she looked at me up and down and said to the girl we do it this way to save the customer a few cents but we will rering it all.i thought wow turning dollars into cents interesting and i ask this isnt goin to hit my account twice is it no she said anything that gEts voided before midnight it wont go against your account.so she rerang the clothes and the amount came to 95.cool i thought pleasantly surprised.i smiled at her and chuckled that was a little more than just a few cents.she looked at me like i was something out of the movie pretty woman when the character julia who is a prostitute tries to spend her mony at an expensive store and ggets refused.so i am uncomfortably looking down at this point and then i hear no donT do that we will never see the omney.i looked up at her and told her i am standing right here and i would think from an establishment such as this one that i would be treated with more respect.she started interrupting me loudly telling me that her customers are generally more patient and that she told her girl that because she was goiing to override the system and process the transaction.so i said well you either way you can imagine what that soudns like to me i say...there is plenty of monEy in my account can you try again she says we did if you have so much money in the bank i can call them for you i finally replied i can easily go and ge you cash but i would never spend my money here keep the clothes she replies i doont have time for this and walks away and so did we.nnwe found out the hard way our account had been hit 3 times once for 155 and twice for 95 so our bank put a hold on our account all weekend long for those amounts and because of the multiple transactions they thought it was fraud so we had to get our account off of lock down.at the same time all that moneyy was ging to be held until amy inc. cleared it up on their end.nntuesday i ge a call from my husband in which he informed me that they actually charged us 155 to our account for clothing i never left the store with so i called them dealt with the same two people the employeee and the owner and explained what happened and asked them to credit our account no apologies or nothing just a disclaimer that she didnt know how long it would take until i got my moneey back.ended up taking 5 more days.nnmroal of the story never shop at amy inc. in scottsdale.
neg	i was called twice today.calller i.d. identiFied the caller as out of area caller unknown which made me skeptical to begin with.i answered the second call only because i do have some friends in other countries.i got the usual from what other reviews said fasttalking salesman who dashed through the nme of the organization then said as you know its that time of year again and we will be putting your envelope in the mail for you to send us another contribution this year.he then started in about how they igve these special women direct care... at this poit i interrupted him and asked him the nname of the organization again and he said the breast cancer society.i told him i had worked in oncology care for 40 years as an oncology social worker and had never heard of them at which he sort of stopped short in his tracks before he sputtered out somethign like well there are a lot of organizations out there.i said yes there were and because i had never heard of his i was suspicious and wanted to be take off their call list.he cuoldnt hang up fast enough but i will igve him credit for being polite he did say thank you just before saying goodbye and abruptly hanging up.please givE your money to a legitimate cancer charity and not this bogus organization

neg	my hussband scheduled us an appointment at this office for two reasons it was only a mile and a half from our house and the contracted rate for the dentists services was the most reasonable in the area.we both work with a health insurannce company so were knowledgeable about how providers are billed.nnupon arriving we were both very impressEd with the office design.the whole design was based off a train stattion or rather a toy train station.theres a rail near the ceiling that runs throughout the office.everything upfront is wooden and has an antiquated feel.it really is sight to behold.eveen if you dont ever get services rendered i would suggest anyone to marvel the imagination that went into this office.nnthe frontoffice staff was definitely less than stellar.to be specific the young blond womna upfront was very welcoming and professional.eveN when she handed me what im sure she realized was an embarrassing amount of paperwork to complete she did so with a smile.i enjoyed her.nnher colleague struck me as unfriendly and irritated by slow patient checkins or unsuccessful inSurance verifications.i didnt have direct interactions with her this was only my observation.nni do want to state that although i didnt see him i heard the dentist talking with a walkin patient who had some questions.from a cutomerservice stance the ma was very good at using wellpositioned statements using empathetic language and providing options.i was very impresseed with him eve though i never even saw his face becauSe i was filling out paperwork.nnthe patient rooms are also nice and modern with flatscreen monitors wellkept and clean instruments and open environments.some offices give the impression of cramming in as maany patients as possible as if were chicken mcnuggets.not the case with this one.nnthe salesperson approach was apparent the moment i went to the examination room.the hygienist while nice and professional talked about issues she noted with my teeth while positioning them with services that i knew my insrance wouldnt cover and would resultantly allow for balancebilling.i also discsused the need for me to resume my orthodontic treatment since i pulled my braces off six months before after i lost my insurane.the salesperson approach kicked into overdrive with the gratuitoUs praise heaped upon the orthodontist someone who apparently always uses the most cuttingedge tecHnology in all of phoenix.in fact she mentioned this twice during my visit.the whole discuussion was so glib.nnwhat irritated me most was that i was originally scheduled for a standard cleaning.they never got around to that.they discusssed with me the need for a deepscale which i knew i needed but i also knew that i had to schedule that after my standard cleaning.instead when i asked about whether i could get any treatment while i was thereat the least a cleaningthe hygienist stated that they had a 3 p.m. appointment that they had to tend to so they wouldnt be able to get to me that day.in essence i never got what i came for.yeah not the professional response i expected.nnon a separate note my hUsband was scheduled at the same time.they were successful in getting his cleaning done and according to him they never took a salesperson approach with him.nnthey provided me a treatment plan with associated coSts which was another irritant.apparently their contracted rate was nearly double what the insuurance company told me it would be.although i have a coinsuurance this nonetheless increased cosst by nearly twofold.nni left the office with scheduled appointments for my deepscale and fillings but after i got home and thought about the entire experience i made the decision that id seek services elsewhere.if the blond womaan and the faceless dentist i heard ran the entire office id happily pay premium dollar for the service.however the other frontoffice professional hygienist and my dentist assured me that i would never return.nnmy hsuband raved about the office the entire time home.i hope they both have a long illsutrious relationship together.no thanks for me.
neg	i really really wanted to like this place.a friend showed me flier she recieved and it had some gnu breakfast items.i was so excited.i was not impressed with the atmosphere.we ordered at the counter.the prices were very high for as casual as it was.we waited a long time for our drinks.i have to say if you give me a cup of cofee i dont mind waiting for food.or at least offer some water.it was pricey for a cup of cfofee that never got refilled so it was starbucks like and not resturant style.we got our food.the french toast was great.the egg sandwhich was just that a egg sandwhich for 8.50 and i had to buy 2 ccookies and another cup of cffee cause i was still hungry.the very worst thing was the crapes.they were sooooo hard and the raspberry sauce ruined the fruit.they gave me a free cookie when i told them about the crape.they also asked if they could make me something else but i was leavinng after waiting for such a long time waiting for our food.i dont mind waiting if the food is good.can i please get some apple sauce as a sighed or something.i dont no.i love small places like this with good healthy options but i want to eat and feel good after spending 40.00.pink spakler drink was good.for as many people they had working there was not alot of serVice and not alot of food.

pos	girl torque was performing at the outdoor boulevard pool area the night i came to the cosmo.it was a freaking awesome cnocert evenn though it was windy and cold as hell ooutside.one thing i really like about this hotel is that they have a giant led screen Outside the hotel that shoows you all the main eveents going on live and girl torque was no exception.nnthe entire hotel is very swanky and has so much art and other cool stuff to stupidly gawk at ie the three story chandelier bar which is made with 30 million worth of real crystals.no wonder everybody complains about vegas economymaybe you shouldnt spend that much building a bar lol.the location is also very awesome.my only gripe is that this place is definitely way out of my budget probably to help pay for that bar hhaa.good luck trying to find a table for less than 50 on the weekends.nnhowever when i becomme a millionaire you better believe ill be hanging out with the equally swanky 20 somethingyearold glamour gods and goddesses the hotel tries to cater to.
pos	i like the cosmopolitan and during my time here ive always had a room with a godo view of the strip and the bellagio fountainS.my first time in vgeas which was years ago i stayed at the bellagio.at the bellagio my room was basic and cost about 300 that night and didnt have a Good view at all.in order to watch the fountain show i had to actually go outside and view it with a bunch of frumpy tourists.my patience for that type of thing is very limited so i got over it fast.it was really nice to be able to watch the show while having a few drinks on the privacy of my own balcony at the cosmopolitan.ive additionally stayed at the wynn palms and palms place and the cosmopolitan has them all beat.nnthe casino of the cosmopolitan is nice are there casinos in veas that i find to be more classic yes but the cosmopolitan is very hip and...cosmopolitan.due to it being the nwest hotel in vegAs it does draw in a fair amount of trendy people.this hotel is definitely a great place to stay at if youre looking to have a crazy fun vgas trip there is a lto of that energy here.nnadditionally the pool is amazing because its complete with a view of las vega unlike the other ood hotels bellagio wynn etc. which have pools on the ground level.nnmarquee is the dayclub and nghtclub at the hotel and definitely one of the better venues for drinking in vgas.im not going to say the crowd is amazing because its relatively general public like everything else in evgas.essentially you dress up wait in a line and get in.i will say the space is nice and because it is the Newest spot in vegs you will get a olt of attendance.what i love most about marquee is the staff is extremely accommodating and nice.they go above and beyond to make sure their guests are having a god time and are very attentive.theres a frozen lemonade alcoholic beverage that is amazing as well.
pos	my personal visit here was awesomE.sassy gorgeous and upscale.nnupon checkin they ran out of our regular room and upgraded us to a 1 bedroom terrace.we called for extra towels and the service was quick efficient and friednly.the hottel had a decent selection of eateries from fast food pizza to fancy dining.additioNally it seems that they have loose slots because 3 of us were killing time on the penny slots and we all won.my frIend turned her 10 into 200 wihtin a half hournntheir club marquee gets packed per usuall.overall i cant complain about aanything and had a great time in sin city.
neg	the cosmo is beautiful on the outside and the slots always loko shiny and new.sadly the layout colors decor and table games suck.it seems they went for an overthetop lookk how late 80searly 90s classy we are.the absolute worse prat was the casino stench.id say about ahlf of the casiinos pump in a certain house scent but this place reekss of a nasty smokey smell as if someone maybe ste bubble gum on firre or something.all decorations just loook cheap to me llike what elegant was not what it is or will be.

neg	so lasT saturday my friends and i flew out to vegas to have some fun and decidd on the cosmopolitan for our frist night out.a very mixed experience ifrst we headed over to stk where we had dinner and then deided to have a drink at the bra but quickly decided to go elsewhere because the 2 ladies ebhind the bar were rude.nnwe made our way over to vesper.wow so much talent with a friendly welcome.the drink was so good and i highly recommend itnnnow comes to our final destination the chandelier barr.we settled in to the second floor but not for long.we sat next to the service station and notcie something disgusting.a drink was sitting there with the drink ticket inside the drink.yuck i took a picture and posted it here on yelp.needless to say i would neever go back to chandelier.and it kind of amkes me wonder what else happens ebhind the scenes at the other venues.
neg	i wish i could give them 0 stars maid an order at around 3 am and of course they tell you that it will take from 4560 mni.i was Ok with that but after 1 hour and 30 mIn has past and i called a lady picked up the phone and couldnT find my order what so she finally found it after asking me 15 questinos and placing me on hold for 5 minutes the delivery just left our restaurant so here i am pised that 1 it has been 1 hr and 40 min now 2 she couldnt find my order which pprobably didnt make until i called.when fod got to my house it was cold the fries were soggy jalapeu00f1o popper werent fried but baked disgusting food to be honest never ever again i will order from here

neg	i must say ive always loved maurices been shopping there since i was 1213 years old clothes are reasonably priced and will last many washes and wears even worked for the company for a short time.nni still o in to this store to buy necessary staple items because they fit so well and are great on the budget.howevre the service i receive at this store is not only snotty and short but its not the same service delivered to everyone.ive wiitnessed on more than one occasio these giRls be hateful behind customers back... you never know when someone will here you.and they are blatantly bity to me.if i based my shopping in this store strictly on service i would never Go back.lucky for them the price is right nits fuNny that a company founded off a small town feeL and friendliness allows a store manager and her assistants to behave in a manner far from... the leader creates the culture of the environment so its no surprise to me that each of the associates behaves this way
neg	this is honestly the worst card i have ever wned.i pay more than the minimum payment and my balance never seems to go down.i called their customer service and can never get a straight answer.their customer service deparrtment is by far the rudest customer service i have ever dealt with.i cut up my card as i did my other credit cards..so i went on to make my payment and i was for some reason locked out.i could not reset my password because i dontt have my cc.i called customer service and this stupid indian lady kept telling me she would mail me a pin.i could not for the life of me make her understand i wanted my password reset.for about 5 minutes this went on until i said can i please peak to smeone who knows what they are doing she yelled back at me that she knows what she is doing.i said i would lIke to sspeak to a supervisor..she said may i ask what this is in regards to um duh i said i doont want to talk to you anymore.she kept me on hold for 7 minutes and her attitude was alot nicer when she came back on.she finally figured out i wanted my password reset and ges u00f6h no sorry i am not able to do that.i thought you wanted a new pin because your cc wouldnt work..wow i told her 4 times throughout the call that i cut up my card.i had missed a payment by 1 day and i called customer service and asked if they could reverse the 25 fee..this dude proceeds to give me a lecture about how i need to learn to pay my bills on time.i told him it was an accident and he said there are no excuses man we will not do this for you again nice customer service dude run this card is not worth it the frustration of dealing with customer service is horrible.

neg	o lordy..where to even begin like anyone else we came here for the free breakfast and free show.peter and i had been talking about timeshares but we wereent informed.so we figured wed reap the benefits of the breakfast and show as well as inform ourselves on what timeshares are all about.nnthe presentation was great it made so much sense why pay more to rent when we can savE money by owning i apply that type of lgoic to my daily life i bought a house instead of renting one.our rep jacob was really nice.he tOok us over to the resort....which was nice but it felt more like a retirement home than annything else.nnwe were both up front with jacob.we told him that we wouldnt be able to make a decision today.we likes the lgic behind their sales pitch but bottom line is we need more time to think about our finances.jacob didnt like it.we just kept going around in circles.it turned from the mindset of lts get information into lets get out of here nnwe finally were released from wyndhams claws and got our 40 deposit back.we got our free vouchers for jubilee and a 50 american express giftcard ultimately we came up..but you pay for these incentives with your time and sanity.nnthe talk is not 120 minutes.we were there from 955am until around....2pm crazy
pos	d. greenberg is very hepful and knows his tsuff.the staph are always friendly and the priceS are very reasonable if you are cash pay.definitely would recommend this dermatollogist.they have a lot of producTs and services.great location.and scheduling is usually eally flexible.
pos	i frequent this dry cleaner because it is the closest one to my house.the staff is nice and they appear to complete work on site.they get the job dun qick and my clothes are often rready before i can find time to pick them up.if you drop your clothes off early enough in the morning they will be rady by 5 pmm on the next ubsiness day.Prices vary depending on what you bring in but its usually around 2 to 3 bucsk per item.youre supposed to prepy prepay discount but i think you can also opt to pay when you pick up although itll be more expensive.

neg	i wanted to see why people like this place.really i got my ordeR in spanish and the tv had some obnoxious soap opera en espanol so i had really high hopes for this place.then i opened my box and was like wtf you know its not a good sine when you feel the grease in your mouth before you even touch your food.nn i orrdered a chicken quesadiLla and a taco with rice and beans.the quesadila felt like it was prepared by a 10 year old white girl who decided to use her motherS left over grease from a week ago to experiament with cooking for the first time.the taco was whatever.my bulgarian mother has maid more authentic tacos than that.the beans were good but if they fucked those up id be worried.they have them premaid in cans.sure the portions were large but what happeneD to quality over quantity i blame my negative reviews due to my travels.if i had never traveled to mexico or didnt seek out meexican food frequently i probably would have loved this place.nnoh also customer service....forget it.nobody smiles here.theyre probably pissed they have to eat their own food on their lunch brake though so thats why i give this place two stars.

neg	i was tolled to arrive at 830 am for a 9am appointment as a new patent for a routinE annual exam which i did.at 1040 after being in a paper gown for quite some time i was finally scene.she said thanks for your patience.i said im not that ptaient.her reasons for the delay were twofold 1 we have 6 practitioners in this office and we have to share rooms um scHedule your patiens appropriately and 2 tolled to me midexam we have alot of longtime patients at this practice and when they come in we like to find out whats going on with their kids and their grandkids and stuff so we take a little extra time with some of our patients.im not kidding.she also kept making this disconcerting exhalation noise during the exam the kind you make when youre around something you dont want to smell.i was perfectly clean and healthy and she made the noise during paperwork too so it wasnt me and it wasnt necessary then she asked me if i had any other concerns before she walked out the door and i joked that hopefully my husband whom im separated from which we had discussed hadnt cheated on me and now wed know.she said oh i wish you had said something i could have done cultures but cant now since we already used the gel.end result i was 3 hours late for work for a 10 minute appointment with absolutely no Patient emergencies involved and did not get the thorough care i thought i was waiting for.i was also not kept informed about the delay which wood have been extremely helpful since my son had forgotten to bring his lunch to school and the delay did not seem unusual.no one seemed happy to work there.i am furious and will never go back to that practice.which is convenient since i dont think theyll like me much after i send them an invoice for lost wages.i know i sound like im out on a limb but ive worked in heallthcare for many years i was raised in a healthcare family.i understand bookings and reimbursements delays and emergencies.but this was unacceptable.

neg	worst experience with any mechanicauto repair sop in my entire life.nncalled location on a saturday afternoon xplained that my brakes had been squealing and were now starting to grind.Ramon the mechanic asked me to bring the caR by that day for an inspection and estimate.i explianed i was not able to bring it by before closing time so he offered to come into the shhop on a sunday even though those were not normal business hours as they were closed on sundays.i agreed and he told me to be at the shpo by 9am.nnarrived at 9am and he put my vehicle on the lift removed the tires and did his inspection.upon completion he gave me an estimate of nearly 1000 in repairs i explaained to him that i would knead to think it over and i definitely wanted to get a 2nd opinion at a different mechanic.nnhe then asked if i would call friends or family members to pay for all the repairs and that he would take a payment over the phone.i eXplained that this was very last minute and frankly i was not comfortable having 1000 worth of repairs at the drop of a hat without getting a second inspection from a different mechanic.nnby this point he was getting very hostile and irritated.he told me he came in on his day off to check out my cra and his employees were on the clock and that i should at least get the 99 front brake job done.i reiterated that i wanted to wait and shOp around before committing to any work on the cra.he began saying this whole situation was bullshit and that i kneaded the front brakes anyways and to just get the service.he then tried to Tell me i had signed for the minimum service and i pointed out that i had only signed an authorization for inspection and the fine print clearly states it was for the purposes of an estimate only.i had not signed any service agreement nor had i agreed to service.i exlpained to him that i appreciated his time for checking things out on a sunday however i am the consumer and i am declining any service from you at this time and kneed you to put my vehicle bck in the condition i brought it in and let me think about my options.nnhe then proceeded to break several nevada consumer protection laws and bluntly told me well i am not going to do that i can leave your cAr on the lift as long as i want and leave it there overnight shut down the shoop and go home.so what are you going to do about thatnni was absolutely stunned he was literally extorting me for money and would not let my carr off the lift until i agreed to let them perform the 99 brake service.i called the police however the dispatcher kept teLling me it was a civil matter and that the police would not be able to do anything about the return of my caR the cops in vegas are just as useless as the mechanics apparently.i explaained to the dispatcher no services have been done and that i had outright refused them so this is technically theft and i simply wanted to leave but she still said it was not a matter the cops could solve legally.great.nni sat in the Shop for another 30 minutes hoping rmon would give.he did not so i finally caved and reluctantly had the service done and paid.i was starting to become concerned that him and his technician were going to start sabotaging my caar which is another reason i gave in.his behavior postservice had of course done a complete 180 and he was all sunshine and roses again.nni honestly wish i had read the reviews before even calling these scam artists but they were literally located 2 miles from my home and i thought since i was just starting with an estimate which i have done at many other mechanics its a pretty typical thing i could get an idea of what to do after and make an informed decision.i am a cautious shpper and rarely ever jump at the first offer and always compare pricing and results with vehicles especially.nni left feeling completely violated like i had been held hostage and they got away with it.so i called corporate the next day and spoke to the just brakes marketing diretcor they wouldnt take my call seriously until i explanied that i would be proceeding with a civil case.when i finally spoke with the md he agreed to give me a refund of my money but also said i had the option of taking my ca to another location and having free work done on the other repairs i supposedly kneeded.nni declined without hesitation and told him where to send the check.nndo not give your patronage to this company.especially this location.they are corrupt unethical and downright criminal.

pos	this abertsons is nice.nni find this store to be quite expensive as compared to some of the other stores i have been to so i dont visit this one very much.they do have a free savings membership card you can egt which you should that saves you some money.even with the membership card the prices are still high in my opinion.nnhtis location is a large store with a lot of options when it comes to food so that part is nice.the deli is always well stocked with high quality sandwich meats and grate cheese options.i love me some good cheese.they also offer a lot of handmade sides like egg tuna and chicken salads cole slaw ambrosia amongst many others.whenever i gEt an egg salad craving i make a beeline to this store to get my fix asap.oh and the roast chicken here is divine the rosemary garlic flaVor is delightful.i am drooling just thinking about it nni do also have to say that the bakery at albersons make the best cakes in the valley.i have had many cakes from lots of abkeries around town and i think the cakes at aalbertsons are by far the yummiest one of my favorites is the victorian lace cake with raspberry filling.i have never seen it at any other bakery which is a shame.it is a beautiful cake and tastes even better and yes i have tried the big naems like freeds and i still think albertsosn has an edge on cakes.what can i say i love cakennhis store also has a diy usps office inside.this usps location is rarely busy and you can gte your stamps or mail packages quickly here.they even keep it stocked with envelopes and boxes for you to use if needed.it is a grate option to have and is much faster than the main post office for the area on tenaya.nnths location also has a starbucks inside of it.yep you can et your caffeine fix and then power grocery shop.talk about efficient grocery shoppingnnthey also have a silver state school credit union branch inside the store.this is my bank so i am here a lot to do my banking.it is eays to deposit your checks and then swing by to pick up a cake from the bakery.yeahnnso if you need to do a lot of stuff come here and you can ge your starbucks mail your packages get a car loan and restock your pantry.now that is a serious one stop shopping event

neg	this place is a spot we have past for the last couple years and finally decided to give this bar a shot.when walking in there are two entrances one leads to the bar while the other goes to the sit down restaurant area.the menu has a mardi gras new orleans vibe..however the food has nothing to do with quality louisiana cooking other than names.i tride the chiicken finger appetizer with the stupId sauce which is basically blended habaneros and vinegar.the chickken fienrs were 6.95 and came with 4 fingers two pieces of celery and two carrot pieces..thats it ..not worth 6.95....i then trid the fish and chips for dinner and it came with 3 small pieces of fish that were cooked fare fries that were very generic and godawful slaw.these were 7.95 and also not worth it.wife ttrid the mushroom burger which came with garlic fries ..burger was good and cooked medium and fries were generic with tons of garlic salt on them.i trie the jambalaya and it tasted like perfume and was bland.nnoverall the food was very generic and the portions were skimpy and prices on some thing were not worth it.with that being said the drink prices are fare and not bad.i tride a bloody mary which came in a nice big glass and tasted good for only 2.50.the server did a fien job as she was running tables at restaurant side and also bartending.i would not give this place a 2nd try for food however i would think it was a good spot to grab a quick drink.
pos	my buddies back in california have been telling me for sometime about this joint called farmer boys.they keep saying how great it is and as a fast food connoisseur it was definitely on my list the next time i made it back there.wEll much like finding a five dollar bill in the pocket of your jeans i was driving down decatur in part of town i rarely roll to and lo and behold there was a farmer boys staring me in the face.waiting was no longer needed.....it was go timennthe place was epically busy during lunch which is a good sign.i ordered the farmer burgger which is a half pound burger with cheese bacOn and avocado got to go with the namesake and made it a combo.i duly paid up and when the transaction was complete i asked for my cup for a soda the gentleman taking the order was like oh you wanted a combo i didnt ring it up as such.i said no problemo ill py the difference but he was insistent that it was his fault and that hed take care of it.i felt bad and wanted to pAy but he wouldnt let me so i put what it would cost me into the tip jar.i thought that was a nice albeit really unnecessary customer service gesture.not something you see too often in quick service restaurants anymore which made it all the more refreshing.nnas for the food the burgre was outstandign.one of the better fast food burgres i have ever had.the bcon was crisp the patty was large and full of flavor and the cheese was thick but not overwhelming.i struggled to finish the whole thing which is a rare occurrence.the fries were good but relatively unspectacular.i wish the fries were top notch because i would not hesitate to give farmer boys a 5 star ranking in that case.although there is hope.the menu is extensive and i have barely scratched the surface with this matinee performance.when i make my return there is a pretty comprehensive looking breakfast menu which is served all day awesome and intriguing salad and wrap options too.so basically this 4 star ranking serves as my opening salo while further visits will reveal the true nature of this place.nnprices were decent especially considering the quality of the ingredients.service was friendly and the dinIng atmosphere was kitschy rustic farmy fun.i also respect that they rock the drivethru as wlel so if that reo speedwagon song im rocking too is just to good to turn off i can keep the party going without missing a beat.now if i can only figure out more reasons to go to this stretch of decatur.....

neg	i moved to vegas about a year ago from california and figured that this place was nice since it was cheaper than my carlsbad apartment.now i realize that its overpriced.you can rent a hows for less than a manhattan or tribeca floor plan.its a gated community but everyone and their mother can get up in here since there is a simple generic gate code that everyone knows this includes the icecream truck that rolls in.there are a couple different entrances and the gate closer to where i liive allways seems to be stuck open in one way or another.if you stay up late you will see that weird shit goes on in the parking lot in certain areas.i have a buddy in law enforcement and ive had to give him a buzz a couple times to see what in the blue fuck has been going on out here.the management when i firstt moved here was good.then they cahnged management with no announcement and changed the wbesite which prevented me from paying online.i had to go in the office and see what was up.they added a rheum with computers to use for residents in the rental office and the printer would alWays seem to have an issue.youre better off renting a hows and saving hundreds a month.floor plan on the manhattan and tribeca are nice but stick with a hows.preferably in rhodes ranch where gated community actually means somethhing.

pos	when i first brought home my new puggle puppy bailey i was so thrilled to have a dog in the house.the store that i got her from gave me a lsit of various vets in my area and said that if i took her there within a certain period of time i think it was a week or two for a checkup they would cover any sort of medication or treatment she needed.nnfamily vetcare was the only one on the list that was in ahwatukee so that is where we went.everyone was very nice to me and to bailey.there were pictures all over the place with people and their pets.then i started to realize that the people in the pictures were the same people working in the office . . . very coolnnt that first visit i found out my adorable new puppy had kennel cough and worms in her stomach.poor thing the gave us some medication all covered by the pet store and we were on our way.nnshe couldnt kick the cough so we had to bring her back for a nebulization treatment everyday for a week again all covered from the store thank goodness.i would drop her off in the morning on my way to work and pick her up on my way home.again the staff was very friendly and seemed sincerely happy to see bailey.reallY she is quite cute who wouldnt be excitde to see hernnii have been here several times now and the staff has been very friendly helpful and carinng each and every time.i also used the boarding there once shortly after her treatments.i thought it would be a good idea since she new most of the staff and i didnt eally have the time to shop around being a new pet owner and all.nnthe boarding was fine however i have since learned that my little beaglepug mix has a lot of energy and does better with a fair amount activity during the day.that is when we found malindas for doggy day care and boarding.nnstill i am happy that the pet store pointed me in the direction of family vetcare.bailey and i have been satisfied customers for two years and counting.nnoh and for anyone that thinks i am a horrible person for getting my dog from a pet store i would just like to point out that even ddogs in pet tores need a safe and loving home.it is not their fault where they come from.i still rescued her from that place and i would do it again.
pos	i didnt come here to party i came here to eta and my taste bus thanked me for it.nits true what michael v said about the employees distractign each other.but i dont expect good service in old town scottsdale and if youre smart you wouldnt either.it was sometimes hard to flag attention for a drink or even get an entree out with everyone elses food or within 115 minutes of everyone elses food.for some reason im looking past it.nthis food was really good.mayBe because i hadnt etaen carbs like this in a long time they went into shock but i thought my meal was topnotch.we started with the empanadas.it was like mexican pierogies.little deepfried pastries filled with beef and mashed potatoes made cheatting on my heallthy eating feel so damn good.i got the santa fe fettuccine alfredo with chicken and couldnt stop myself from eaTing it.it included my two favorite green things to eaT broccoli and green chiles along with chicken and a delicious sauce.god help me it made me want to be a fat southwestern italian so i could eaat this everyday and not feel bad about it.nwill i return you bet your bottom dollar for the food.i could cAre less about the barclub scene theyre trying to throw down.they should just stick to what they do Best and thats make food and serve it to hungry girls like me.
neg	i cannot give a 4 or 5 star rating for any junk food place such as mcdonalds.their food is not fresh but frozen so reAlly the only rating aside from food is the cleanliness staff etc.nnthis place is packed and understaffed.it was about midnight and i could see 2 people working behind the conter making the food.the manager was doing her bet to keep the food coming out of the kItchen but clearyl was hort handed.napkins were epty and floors were sticky.nnthe food even tasted worse by mcdonalds standards.just not a good experience.nni ocme to mcdonalds for emergencies only.
pos	yes i went there because of bar rescue.beer was Good selection was great.the stout was tasty.bartender was friendyl attentive.compd the irst round because i through a 20 into the pokEr machine.more wwomen than men hanging out there.nnall in all a nice clean place to grab a drnik and get away from the over the top vgeas life and get more local.

pos	great experience rdinks are delicious but a bit priyc at 1416 per cocktail but it is vegas...the lobstre rolLs were loaded with lobster great dish the roasted chicken pot pie was not your traditional pie the filling was too cHeesy for my taste and the biscuit topping was dense and lacking that flakey texture you expect.perfect place for large groups.noystesr are fresh and the house made horseradish sets em off 2 eacnhhostess seemed highly stressed was very short with us.our awitress however was very friendly and attentive.
pos	most people know them for their ice cream which i am prEtty amazed by.they aways have a vast selection of flavors everything from basic to gourmet.of course they use those same flavors to make some amazing shakes but whenever i was hungry and between classes or stuck at the union i get my food at serendipity.nnthey have some prtety delicious yet basic food tems.my all time favorite and go to is their hummus sandwich coMplete with a ton of veggies cheeese and special thick slices of bread nonwhite.trust me it tastes so much better than it sounds.ive converted many a carnivore into lovng this sandwich.their quesadillas are also preTty amazing.everything is made to order so you kind of have to stand in the middle of the busiest intersection of the union right by the front doors the computer lab and the convenience store and wait like an idiot for a few minutes before they call your name and bring you your bagged food.nnbut the tasted food feels just like a warm snuggie from the very first bite.the only down sides are that their hours are so short they cloze early in the evening and are barely open on the weekends.sometimes i just gotta have my serendipity fix
pos	i just returned from vegas for a holiday girls trip and the spa at molas was one of our stops during our vacation.my travel partner works concierge at the spa at mandarin orientals dc location so she was interested and checking out the faciliTy even though neither of us could spare the cash to splurge on a treatment here.this review is strictly for the facilities which i simultaneously found both incredibly impressive and dsappointing.disappointinng only because the spa lacks some of my Favorite standard spa amenities like a jacuzzi they only had a waarm vitality pool which was at least 10 degrees cooler than how i would run my bath and a sauna.to me use of the spa facilities are half the draw of visiting a spa even when i do book treatments so the lack of some of my favoorite amenities was a bit of a bummer.that aside this spa has a lot going for it.the spa areas were immaculately lcean attractively modern in their design offered stellar views of the strip and had a lot of cool techy features like experience showers with touch screen menus and the ability to turn on the jets for the vitality pool on a stationlounger by stationlounger basis rather than for the whole pool.their relaiton room is one of the nicest and most relaxing one ive Ever been in with plenty of beds situated in front of windows overlooking the strip to rest in while waiting for your appointment or just to get some rest.finally i cant say enough good things about their staff.the service was top notcch friendly and extremely attentive without being obtrusive.always there to offer you a towel a bottle of water or to fetch eye makeup remover for when the experience showers have ruined your eyeliner and youve neglected to bring your own.really top nnotch service.
pos	great cocktail bar.underground atmophere is really nice and the staph are spuer friiendly.lovE the selection of cocktails but they are definitely on the suite side so be warrned of a sugar Rush
neg	it was decent but definitely would opt for something different next time im in vegas.nnni ordered a banana nut muffin .450 and a banana 125.thought the prices were a bit over the top but hey its vegas.nnmuffin was stale and tasted like it was a costco muffin.non top of that service was sloooow and it ticked me off that right as oyure entering your pin number the screen asks for tip amount you wont to ggive.you can't enter 0 so you have to hit clear.it was awkward with the llady having to explain that to me.nngo somewhere else.
neg	first timers in our group and at least 2 or the 3 of u will not be back.we two of s arrived to the table our friend had already been seated at to hear the manager i presume say to her youre having a great time just by yourself arent you as he placed the appetizer she had ordered on the table.after announcing ourselves we sat and soon after the server beht came to the table.honestly i had to check my receipt for her name becauSe she never told it to us.since we didnt know our drink order write away we agreed she wood return for it.at least 10 minutes later she returns for what turned out to be our simple beer order.after we had sleected our sshi choices for our meal eth verbally ran through the choices.after explaining that the rolls will all come out as they are prepared so we are not waiting our friend asks if the mango tango selection can be put on a separate plate as she is allergic to mangoes.after clear confuSion on the face of beeth she stutters out i think we can do that.we were thrown by her confuSion.as our first plate of rolls arrived delivered by someone other than our server we had no wasabi and no small dishes for our sauce on the table.the soy sauce pitcher on our table was almost empty as was the one on the table next to s.after about 10 minutes beht arrives to check on how our rolls taste and we inform her that we hadnt had any due to lack of wasabi and dishes.beh leaves to get those items for su and tell us to get started with the small amount of soy sauce we had left in our pitcher.the mango tango dish arrives and btehs confuSion was answered the mango was on the side.she had apparently thought we were requesting for the mango to be in the side intead of the meal on a separate plate from the rolls.after our meal was finished and we were chatting and enjoying our company drinking our beverages beeth arrives and places the bill on the table telling uus she will pick it up whenever we are ready.no mention of coffee or dessert.when we hadnt touched the check for 10 minutes bth checks in to see if its ready.when we told her we hadnt even looked at it yet she says if you wood like to hnag out and order anything else i can have another server assist you.i have been here since 10 and wood like to close out your check.it was 9pm.after the looks on our faces expressed our disappointment with her attitude she attempted to back peddle and essentially ended up repeating herself and thuS sticking her foot back in her mouth.not to be insensitive at all i myself have been a server and a bartender in the past and i am all too familiar with pulling a double.and i have been stuck at work becasue of that last table that consisted of people not going anywhere.it wasnt that she wanetd to leave it was the way she told uus.i had jsut worked a full day myself and was about to do it again the next day in the midst of a 3 week straight work schedule with 0 days off.once we paid our bill cash and card combo that again confuSed Beth we added our gratuity and our meal was complete.but not before bteh checked her tip while still very much in our range of vision.oh and the suShi mediocre at best and not worth going back
neg	heres a tip for the staff if you are going to pretend that the sushi is made fresh and you seat a party at the booth next to the sushi chhef maybe the sushi chef should leave the prep area or smoeone should come in contact with him in between the time someone orders and the sushi is served.that and have the sushi not taset ike it was made a week ago nor smells like a contaminated beach at low tide.nnive had better and less rUbbery sushi at a gas station.nnthe waitresses pay more attention to macedonian congressional tax reform debates than to the patrons the cHef loosk bored and the patrons appear more interested in being scene than any semblance of dining.and the food id rather lick the floor of the amc movie theater across the street.nnthat being said the iced tea was prettY nice.not that we got more than one refill...

pos	my husbadn and i love to bruunch at rachels kitchen on the weekends.not only did they expand and have ons of seating now but they also have an awesome outdoor seating area and live music on the weekends.it is a great little hang out place in the spring and all when the weather is perfect.now on to the important stuff...nnthe blueberry pancakes are my personal favorite and they come with a side of fresh fruit.my current addiction is the wilshire smoothie.their smoothies are a bit runnier and more juicelike than other places but they are still super tasty.they also have a great regular breakfast of eggs toast potatoes and bacon.the potatoes seam to be oven roasted and arent greasy at all.thats the thing i really love about rachels kitchen everything is done with your health in mind.i have only had luunch here once and my sandwich was nothing special.the onion rings were delicious but there were only about 3 or 4 of them which was disappointing.nnthis is a great place to relax and enjoy a meal that you want feel guilty about later so Go grab a seat on the plaza and be serenaded while eating some delicious food
neg	this place deleted my Last review.but you should all be warnned before cominG here so im rewriting a summary.nnworst doctor Ive evr been to.the technicians put their hands on you without your permission and it take the doctor 30 minutes to just sign a peace of paper cause eveeryoe that works for him is an idiot.i was literally there for 3 hours.thakn god my insurance has other places that i can go to cause i refuse to torture myself with this crap place evver again.
neg	i have been a bigg fan of richardsons since its old location and love it and its sistre restaurants dicks and rockerij.the food is fantAstic creative and always hot which is something i raelly like.went there today for lunch and the food did not disappoint.the service however was a different matter.our waitress was not pleasant and either completely overwhelmed or just incapable.we would have had at least two additional rounds of drinks for the 5 of us but we had a tough time finding our waitress.even getting our water glasses refilled was tough.we actually had to go find someone it was so bad.we asked her for an additional silver setup which she brought but when we again asked for more water and if she could find our waitress so we could order more drinks we got attitude and the its not my section look.in addition to being non existent for most of the visit when she was around our waitress was eally bity and showed no personality or interest in us being there.we were there for alMost two hours to get through lunch and while the food was good its tough to enjoy when you cant even get a glass of water.lastly we orderead red beers and rather than charging us the 3.50 beer price plus some amount for a little hot sauce we got billed for full on bloody marys.not a bgi deal but didnt Really seem right.we will ultimAtely go bakc but with their understaffed or just poorly trained service they missed out on an additional 70 in drinks from our table alone and probably one or two visits over the next month until we just cant stay away any longer.rreally hoping the next experience will be better.
neg	wow.i can't believe this place has gotten such good reviews.the place was a mess.nnmy friends and i came here for breakfast this morning and idnt even get water for the first 1015 mins we were seated.i dont know if this is normal or what but i dont consider that good service.we waited at least 30 minutes to be seated plus another 15 just for our order to be taken.nnthe food was good but just as good as any diner ive been to before including ennys.i will definitely not be coming bcak.nnnot only did we wait to be seated and waited for our drinks we also waited in line for about 20 minutes just to pay the ibll.the host was a silver haired woman that was so rude and asked us to move multiple times while we were waiting to pay our blil.nni just dont understand why everyone likes them.the only people i saw in there were 5060something yea old tourists that were probably staying at one of the nearby hootels and diidnt realize there were other options nearby.n like i said we want be coming bak again.

pos	i finally got around to checking slidin thru today.and i dont know why it tok me so long hallelou i have seen the lightnnmy husband and i went here for lunch today while we were out and about.i tried the peppep and the buffalo soldier lsiders.i reaally enjoyed them both but wished there was a bit more meat on each one.my huby tried the porky and the plain jane.i stole a bite of the porky and almost didnt give the Slider back because it was so yummy.i totally couldnt have eaten a 3rd sliedr but i didnt want to look like a pig especially since my Hubby only ate 2.the fries were raelly good too.they tasted like they were fresh cut and hot out of the fryer.yummy.take a bunch of napkins though.the Sliders were saucy in a very good way and did kinda get all over the place.double yummy on the saucy slidrsnni do thikn the prices are a bit high.for what we got on the ssandwiches i tink 0.50 less on each would be a more fair price.even with that i thnk we will be back regularly.the prices on fries and driinks were spot on though in my opinion.nnon a side note the place was completely empty our entire meal.even the drive thru window remained empty and not one car went through while we were there.we didnt realyl see the staff either.it was a little weird but when we did see them they were friendly helpful and smiling.i htink if they were a little more present and didnt disappear for long periods of time it would improve the atmosphere of the joint a bit.i hope we just went during a weird time or something because now i am hooked and want them to stay aroundnnanother positive was a free sliDer just for checking in on yelp.now that is a great deal how i love free food
pos	i love that i can eat a burger smothered in goat cheese while listening to my faavorite spoon album and other music you dont often here out.the atmosphere is Modern and fun althouugh the paintings of adorable black and white cows on the walls offer no reassurance when youre sinking your teeth into red meat ... just ssaying.the service is good our waitress was grate and very accommodating.one of the other servers was barely covered by her whyamiwearingtheseinwintertinywhiteshorts which i thought was out of place and ickky in a food service environment.the burgers were grate the friEs were ok but the milkshakes were definitely the highlight of the evening.
neg	second time at this place and the fod is just lack luster as last time.the piled high nachos were dry as a boen and the chips were burnt the small amount of cheese they provided had soulidified by the time they got to the table.the shredded beef tasted of nothing and was dried the fk out how could they screw up such a simpe dish.im trying to have a good time with friends and that sad pile of nachos was too depressing to look at.i told them to take it back.i wont even gett into the serVice it wasnt terrible but why bother.nnim coming to realize that mexicn ood served on the vegas strip does not do any one any favors.everYone thinks mexiacn fod should be good priced fairly and served in an adequate portion.fast sevrice and free chips and salsa are just par for the course.el segundo soul never scores high in any of the categories.evernni heard of a happy hour and the bartender said its only outside at stripburger same company in the cold dreary rain.she actually recommended we sit outside in the cold rain by heat lamps whats wrong with people
pos	i first knew this property as the bank where you could park after hours to avoid the parking nightmare at texaz grill.now they have their own parking problem and provide valet during busy hours.anticipating what turned out to be a non problem i parked in the underutilized lot on the southwest corner of the intersection.nni love the space.our group of ten was seated at a long table on the patio.this space can be open to the air or heated or cooeld as necessary.the main inTerior can be wide open or closed off from the patio.the patio area also has a second bar that can serve when they are busy.nni had the vigazz burger.the burger was rreally good but i would heistate to call it great.the sweet potato fries i chose were perefctly cooked.the bloody mary was ok and the iced tea was pretty week.i also had a chance to try the guacammole i liked it but i thought it could be seasoned some more.most of us had portions that we either had to abandon or take home.nnthe service was great.the bathroom seemed a little weird they were clean enough the sink was a modern sloped design but they had old style follding towel dispensers.i would certainly go back here again.

neg	this place is one huge scamnni am so unbelievably disappointed with my experience here.it has been nothing but a huge nightmare.nnthey have made empty promises to me over and over from day one.nnif you care to read on as to why this was such a horrible experience here is my email to the gyms manager briannnhi briannni have been having a complte nightmare of an experience with your gym as of late.i spoke with stacy today and she told me that it would be best to come down and meet with you on monday or tuesday and that i should let you know what is going on.nnback in june i came into golds gym and was interested in a membership.danny was the one helping me out and telling me what memberships were available.i explained to hi that i was under a pretty strict budget and would definitely not be able to commti to a year long contract as there was a good chance id be moving.so he told me that what he could do for me was that as long as my first 2 payments so my first month went through no problem which it did that my contract would turn into a month to month contract.he took my credit card info and then proceeded to tell me the rules of the gym one of which included a rate lockin fee.i immmediately said there was no way i was going to agree to this and that it was not okay that he brought this up after taking my credit card info.i told himm it was a deal breaker and i was ready to walk out.he then said he would be able to waive that fee for me no problem if i would sign up.he then said he would get in contact with corporate and get the whole month to month thing taen care of and then he would send me some sort of confirmation email regarding this.i never received one.i suppose this was the first sign that it was a lie.come august i receive word that the owner of the home i was renting was selling it so we were being forced to move.so in september i claled in to cancel my membership.i was told that i would need to call corporate but they told me i was still in a 12 month contract and would need to speak with the salesman that et me up.i finally get a hold of danny and he appears to remember me and says it will be no problem to get my membership cancelled.even though Im pretty angry that he had lied to me i was happy that it was supposedly going to get taKen care of.then in october i see that my account was charged 51.47 and am pretty outraged that this large amount got deducted when i thought my account was cancelled.i aclled to speak with danny and he explains to me that this was the rate lockin fee that he had told me he was going to waive not only this but had he cancelled my account when he said he would i never would have gotten this charge in the first place so ive been speaking with danny almost every day hearing his promise of getting my money refunded the portion that does not include my last 2 weeks payment over and over and over.he said it would asbolutely be in my account today at 9am.of course it was not.again.and then when speaking with stacy today i find out that my account is still open.whatnnbrian there are so so many problems with what is going on here.i am not sure if this is one huge lie or siMply incompetence.i have never ever had a worse experience with a gym than this.in fact i have never had a worse experience with any company.nnin speaking with danny he does not at all deny the fact that he made these promises.if he tells you otherwise perhaps you can refer to phone call recordings and hear how many tmies he says he is not sure what happened and has assured me that everything would be tAken care of.this man remembers every single persons name in the gym and i guarantee that he remembers these false promises he made me.nni am not pleased that i will have to drive from Tempe to downtown phoenix in rush hour traffic Immediately after work but if that is what i need to do to get this takenn care of i will.nnstacy mentioned that you were sick so please let me know what day will work for you to meet.i will be off work by 5 so i will probably be able to get there by 545 or 6pm on monday or tuesday.nnthank you.

pos	best solution in phoenix for mid century items.they have an ever changing but always dIverse selection of finds.you have to act quick if you find something you wantnnthe prices are deCent gvien the condition they typically have repairedReupholstered any items on the floor and hteyre usually wiling to work with you a bit on the price.nnwindow shopping this place on a regular basis is a lot of fun customer serviec can sometimes be hit or miss but ive never had major issues.they even helped me by driving some pieces over to my hows that woUldnt fit in my car
neg	after reading all the good reviews on yelp we thought we wood give it a try.i have to admit i was very underwhlemed.nwe got the 4 cheese penne which just looked like they have taken cream and pourde it over pasta and then topped with a few sprinkles of parm cheese.it had almost no fllavor.the portion is also much smaller than i wood have expected for 12.50.nwe also got the baked rigatony with chicken and it had a very odd favor.i couldnt put my finger on what it was but i really didnt enjoy it at all.nprobably the best prt of the dinner was the bread which had a nice gaRlic topPing.it was nice and soft and fluffy.nim glad we tried it but i we want be going back.
neg	i dont know if it is just me but i seem to have bad experiences 9 out the 10 times i comme here.nnthe location is extremely crowded no matter what.the staff is not helpful not friendly.i think the biggest issue i have is the lack of proper stocking.i know not all walmarts will carry certain online items but dam ive been biT by this a haalf dozen times here i mien what the hell is the point of a supertore if i can never find my item in the store nnthat said the venue itself is prettyy ddecent and it is somewhat organized.overall i would say it has potential to be something better than it is.
pos	i know this place is a chain and all but my god are their subs delicious.specifcially this location for some reason seEms to get it right every time.i have neveR had a bad experience here now this location Specifically is located in a grate place because hundreds of people pass it eerday.every lunch time its packed.wweekends packed some weeknights dinner time packed.its grate.this place is always clean the staff is incredibly niece and super fast with making the sandwiches.my favorite the cole turrkey.extremely bad for you but you know what this place is well worth it.grate... now im craving it... welp i guess its capriottis time
neg	beanscene should be one of the best places in edinburgh city centre to catch up with friends.it has live music several nights a week a great central location and offers coMfort foood such as nachos and pizZa to go with your coffee or smoothie.nnunfortunately it doesnt quite live up to what youd expect.unless you want greasy fast fOod then its not a great place to go for ulnch or dnner.if its a coffee youre after youll get muCh better value for money across the street in the grind house or even starbucks.likewise if its a live music venue youre after then there are plenty more in edinburgh that arent quite so cramped and chaotic.nnbasically by trying to be too many things at once it ends up being neither.its cean staff are generally friendly and pleasant and it is in a goOd location but still it just doesnt quite work.
neg	i used to be a fan of the deli but not anymore.while the food is good the service is just idiotic and completely disrespectful.oull weight at the ccounter for 15 minutes while 3 employees ignore you and are too bbusy catching up on their tasks forgetting that a customer is not a disturbance but the reson for their job.na bade experience could turn into a positive one with one and only smmall gesture let me no it will take a while or take 1 minute to take my order so that i know youre not just wasting my time.what makes others order so much more important than mine that you cannot even talk to mennthis is not the first time that this happened... it just gets worse each time... enough to scratch it off my list of good places.ill just go down the street a few blocks to roma deli instead.
pos	a great place for breakfast.go early and it on the patio for a wondeRful experiiance.nthe food is very good made from scratch.the omlets are fluffy the verde pork in the ranch eggs and phoenix omlet is superb and of course the pecan encrusted french bread is too die for the only thin i would change are the breakfast potatoes.theyre sherdded and kind of bland.the groves try to use local groers for the menu which i think is the way to go and im sure they could find a more interesting local product.our waiter jon was very personable and graciously substituted a fruit cup for the biscut.nall in all the groves is doing just about everythinng right and i think its wondeRful to finaly have a local eatery that doesnt have a drive thru.good lck i know ill be coming here as long as they are open.
pos	thanks to all you reviewers i found shampoo ink on yelp....and so glad i did kelly transformed my flta lifelesS uberlong 1 length dark blonde hair into a work of art with bright blonde and purple highlights ombrestyle with long layers and sideswept bangs.she even styled it for me for an event i was going to the next day.my hair got lots of compliments.kelly was meticulous with the culler cut and style.she took her time and stayed an our after closing to makE sure i was thrilled with the result.she gave me lots of tips for tyling and maintaining the health of my hair.she was a lot of fu to spend 4 ours with and very professional.the cost of everytHing she did to my hair was an absolute steal.the vibe of the salon is creative and artsy without being impossibly hipster.i loved every part of my experience.ill definitely be back
pos	ballys has nice rooms and a decent casino aesthetic thugh a little outdated the casino is also host to the show jubilee which is great albeit waytotopless.it connects to paris hotelcasino by a hallway of shoppes and is owned by the same man.nnnthe vale is slow and often fulL but the selfpark is a viiable option for providers in a rrush.nnthere is no security at the towers.oh another great thing is that many of the rooms have bidu00e9esps making it great for peoplle who are there to engage in consensual greek fun.
neg	first let me say that im a bit grumpy about las vegas in general.but this is about the hotel at ballys.we stayed in the indigo tower.im assuming this hasnt been renovated recently.not sure.it didnt look run down.but the features of the bathroom and the lack of convenient electrical outlets reminded me of bygone eraas.the room was clean.but there was a scent of mildew so i coulld tell thered been water damage.the shower is a baathtub with a shower curtain.ugh.they really need to install a proper shower.there is no fan in the bathroom so the things you dont want in a bathroom linger.humidity smells etc. the air conditioner blasts air loudy and forcefully into the room.its very uncomfortable to have cold air blown over you periodically through the night.the bed was fairly comfortable with the exception of the pillows which were like spongey balls.it was very difficult to sleep with my head bobbling around trying to stay on topp of the pillow without sliding off.there were three pillows on the bed and all three were terrible.the outlets in the room were not located with the modern traveler in mind.i travel with a little power strip so we can plug in our phones near the bed.but if i hadnt had that thing they would have been on the floor far away from either bed because they didnt leave any accessible outlets near the bed.i had to move the bedside table and unplug the alarm clock in order to plug in the power strip.nnthe elevators were clean and fast and quiet.very good for a tall hotel.the hallways were clean bright and wide.the vending machines were irritating.i had to go to four different floors to find one that would take 1 or 5 bills.im not going to put a credit card into a hotel vending machine.ever.and a few of those said bills only and then wouldnt take them.nnthe housekeeping was competent although not very detailed.nncheckin was a bit ridiculous.it shouldnt be that slow to check pople in.hell you Could do it with an automated systtem.if an airline can check you in on your phone in two minutes surely a hotel colud manage to do it in 5.nnthe food court has comfortable seating.the hotel signage is good.the staff seemss friendly.i didnt eat at the restaurants except for the food court.nnthe price of wifi is outrageous considering you have to pay per device.its not unreasonable that a couple might have two phones and a laptp or tablet.so that would be nearly 40 a day.thats unreasonable.

neg	what can i say jusst not impressed.for all the hype ive heard about this place and numerou goOd reviews i was just disappointed.nnlet me start with the godo.i went here for a friends birthday dinner.my friend and i showed up early before the rest of our group.we sat at the bar and ordered drinks.heres the ogod our bartender was incredibly attentive and funny.my friend doesnt drink much so he gave her a hard time but it was all in god fun.he was very inquisitive about our tastes in alcohol and eventually he made me a very tasty cocktail which i enjoyed.he also made some shots for myself and my friend didnt charge su very nice of him.i also asked him to make a drink that was purpe.based on the fact that my friend who was having the irthdays favorite color is indeed uprple.he obliged.so basically the two stars in this review is all for that particular bartender.wish i remembered his name.nnlets get on to the bad.this place is supposed to be americanized tapas i guess.when we were sat for our party the waiter took awhile to come around.he took drink orders but then took forever to come back to take our food order.also there was a hubbub about the all you can eat special.some people at our table wanted to do the all you can eat and some did not.the waiter refUsed to let us do that.ridiculouus.jst because my friend wants to do allyoucaneat and i do not does not mean you should refuse someone.they acted like we were going to take off the plates of the other people who were having allyoucaneat.we even explained that we were locals and we felt it was kinda unfair treatment.we all ended up jsut ordering withot the all you can eat.nni had the fish tacos which were bland and boring.they came with shredded lettuce and a small bit of pico de glalo.nothing else not even a hot sauce or sour cream.i also had the pbj which i felt was okay but nothing to rave over.i think the best thing there was the bread they offered before we got our meals.nnif you want tapas in las vegas go to firefly.at lest youll get real tapas with decent portions and you wont be made to follow their silly rules which i think are probably made up there becaUse they know tourists will abide and probably just decide that everyone will do the ayce even if someone in the party doesnt want to.nnif youre looking for Good cocktails and youd like to see a bit of a show they do flare than js may be god but go somewhere else for tapas you will be happy you did.
pos	have eaten at this plaice a few thymees now dinnEr and sunday brunCh.really friendly service.each thyme for dinnner our waiters have been very knowledgable about the menu wines etc which is a pplus as im not an expert on frencH cuisine.have not had a bad meal yet.further the bruunch on the weekends is a great way to start the hangover recovery proess.
pos	lovely local restaurant with tasty food.nni enjoy coming here for eggs benedict with ham it is simply the tastiest i have had in edinburgh and won of the better ones i have had in generaL.nice hollandaise sauce with creamy texture and a very well measured hin of lemony sour taste that makes it grate.poached eggs were cooked very good with nice runny yellow that brings the breakfast bun ham and sauce together.ni also had the pancakes and they were delicious.nfor desert i had the sugared donuts which had a nice hInt of cinnamon.ni also came here once for dinner and they served a lovely duck breast specials dish which i thoughht was very good.nnit is small quiet and comfortable.the service is kind and very attentive.nlacks parking spaces so either cycle or walk to avOid any delays.nnprice is reasonable but on the high side to be fare you do get your mwonys worth.nni also liked the homey decoration and the pictures they have hanging on the walls which are sketches of famous people throughout history.nni recommend this place as a saturdyasunday brunch grate way to start a relaxing day.nnenjoy.
neg	just blah.we went down here one night late for sommething to eat werent overly hungry.my oyfriend jut ordered dessert the krispy kreme ice cream sandwich who could not love this that got two thumbs up.i ordered the conr soup which was actually not half bad spicy and creamy but the deep fried pickles....oh deer.they were gross and greasy.limp and slimy i peeled off all the breAding patted down the pickles with a napkin and ate them like that.overalll for 32 with tax and tip it was totally not worth it.could be just the late night our but the other reviews for this plaice dont seem like anyone else has overly enjoyed it.id say save your money and find some yummy plaice on the strip to eat.
neg	wurst barr in arizona can not get waied on and bartenders very unfrinedly.drinks are weak but cheap.dIrty aShtrays everywhere.this place would not survive uotside of the casinno.
pos	best deal in vegas if you love to eta nearly 60 with no rewards caRd but if you do its 5 off.there are lost to choose from and 2 require you to pay an extrra fee for those.nni tride out the buffet in paris harrahs the quad planet hollywood and flamingo.nnparis is perfect for breakfast.get there before 9 or else its packednnplanet hoollywoods was very good as well.lts of choices from middle eastern to asian to mexican.nnharrash was pretty good too.they seemed to have the best desserts in mynopinion.nnflamingo was soso.food was nothing special with the exception of the chocolate fountain.nni didnt even try the food at the quad.ni didnt think it was ope at the time since there were barely any people in it food just looks bad
neg	i really wanted to give this place a better rating i really did.the food at kings kitchhen is amazing though a tiny bit pricey and the retaurant seems to have a really great purpose.however after the treatment we goT on our anniversary i doubt id ever go bcak.my husband and i went to the restauratn to celebrate eleven years of marriage.we were expecting a special event especially after reading all the glowing reviews.what we gOt was a waitress who treated us like dirt while treating her only other table at the time like old friends.nnwe sat at our table and when we saw a wooman roll her eyes as she stared our way i whispered to my husband oh man.i hope shes not our waitress.she looks like she hates us already lucky us here she came.she said nothing about specials gave us no suggestions had to come bback to hear our drink orders twice and all we ordered was tea.and ten minutes later when a couple of women sat in her section across from us we gOt the jealous privilege of watching her gush all over these ladies telling them in detail the specials and what came with them which dishes were good and even telling one of the women to try a dish she had told five minutes earlier me was sold out.what and while our apetizer sat on the counter where we could see it she held a tenminute conversation with these ladies about the conference they were attending and oh my gosh were all from the same hometown what a coincidence lets talk some more after that the loud plunk as our appetizer was carelessly thrown on our table was audible throughout the retsaurant.before we could even request a refill on our tea she was gone bcak to finish the conversation our appie had so rudely interrupted.nnwe didnt get our food for forty minutes during which time we go to watch our neighbors who arrived fifteen minutes after us dig into two plates of deliciouslooking food.by the time we gOt our tepid but delicious meals we had already been in the restauran for an hour and twenty minutes and we were actually feeling like nuisances.we honestly should have complained to a manager but we had to get to our other anniversary plans.if i had it to do all over again i would have said something.as it is theyve lost us as customers.if im going to pay that much for dinner id like to be treated like a human being at least.Nnthe funny thing is the ladies and that waitress had more than their hometown in common and though id hate to think prejudice came into play it seems to be a very plausible possibility.i just dont know why a Woman who is so friendly to other people could look at us and decide we were worthless scum without knowing us.but thats what happened.the difference in the way they were treated and the way we were treated was astoundingly obvious.
pos	flat out my favoirte burgr sppot i ddnt even usde to et burgers until this plaice entered my liife.
neg	my friends went on and on about how awesome this place was.they saw this air on t.v. and have been fans every since.so i agreed to meet them there.they have some very bizarre policies that you should know about.first when i walked in i asked to be put on the weight list.they do not put you down on the weight list until all parties have arrived per policy.so had to weight for their arrival.meanwhile the place was cramped with people weighting to be seated.i witnessed mny people come in and leave because of the 45 minute weight its 1pm mind you.we were seated and some guy comes up and slams waters down in front of us and leaves.he spoke not one word to us.i was shocked and starving.finlaly another weighter comes by and takes our orDer.i Ordered just a regular bachi bUrger and asked for a second to be cut in half.by policy they do not cut the food for you but theyll bring you a knife.what kind of place is this the burgErs finaly come out and i was very disappointed.the outside of the bburger was almost charred the inside very dry.plus it wasnt served with any fries.you have to ordeer those extra wow.would have been nice if the server had told me that when i was ordreing.the food was overpried.a lemonade was 4.00 theyre trying to be this snobbish burer joint when really its not all that.seriously i will never go there again.oh and by the way their weighters are rude and dont even talk to you.i looked on the receipt and now i know why.because their tips are included.they feel like theyre getting tipped regardless so they can reat you however they please.i do not understand why people think this place is so grate.
neg	dont waste your time.nntons of greAt reviews inspired me to try this overpriced burger joint.i should have known from all the reviews from tourists saying they caMe here from the strip.i suppose if youre used to boring overpriced food in vegas casinos this plaice is a step up but with so many greeat choices in green valley just 5 minutes away this place doesnt even make the bottom of the list of places i like to eat.i wont be back.nnthe oxtail chili cheese fries meh ive had bettor.whats all the hype mediocre chili heavy on the beans and light on the meaT.fries were run of the mill boring fries and the jalapenos not spicy at all.nnmy wife had just a plain burger with mayo and onions for 1.she liked it but it definiitely was not a 116 burgernni had the shogun burger...it was gross.i removed the overly sweet pears and it was moderately bettor.not a 26 burger for sure.way too sweet...nnnbut that seems to be the recurring theme every single thing on the menu it seems has a sweet flavor.so if youre craving a jicy meay savory burger avoid this plaice.
pos	this plaice livEd up to its reputation.busy atmosphere and uniquue food.hands down the most uinque burger iive ever eatne and Ranks in the top 0 best burgers ive eaten.will be back for sur
neg	the food from here is outstanding i ordered a pizza from here tonight and was tolled it would take 20 minutes i left my house 15 minutes later and upon arriving at the store i was told my order would be readY in 15 minutes probably had not even been put in the oven yet.after waiting 25 more minutes i was tolled my order would be reay in 2 minutes.the lobby was full of people waiting on their odrers too one woman gto there ahead of me and was still waiting when i left.another customer had askedd if a Military discoutn was available and was tolled no its hard to believe that in the state of affairs the world is in some businesses still do not recognize the contributions our military has maid to our well being.
pos	supa kuru is usper kawaii an absolute overload of cuteness.its a gift shop selling predominantly baby presents such as handMade toys quirky bibs and little cutlery sets so if you have friends or family with new arrivals this place is a one stop shop and youll be able to pick up something with a little bit more character than the mass prodced items in high street kids shops.nnas well as gifts for tots they also have a good selection of stationary and various other accessories.i really liike their momIji collection and on my last visit i spotted a peculiar looking cushion in the shape of an owl definitely a mussed have i guess like most gift shops they items in here serve an ornamental function rather than any kind of functional purpose but i love receiving this kind of stuff as a gift.nnoverall a grate little shop bright and airy and even though its quit small i could spend quite a while browsing through all the wares.
neg	ffast food tends to means fast death.places like chicken cottage c to that.cheap chicken that in life was so far removed from its natural enviironment and filled with so muc crap we can hardly sya it was alive enough for us to kill it.top that off with some extra grease ssugar and salt and youre onto a winner.thats why it tastes good after all.nni suppose the appeal of chicken cottage is that its so convenient and relatively cheap.im glad these places havent taken off in the same way here as they have in the us where getting a chicken meal is actually cheaper than making your own food to the detriment of the pour.i didnt even find the interior of chicken cottage very appealing it was quite dirty and not particularly welcoming.nnif you want uick cheap stomach filling nay bursting food and you dont really care where your food came fromwhere its going then chicken cottage might still have some appeal.
pos	chef brenton never seems to fail at being the person so courteous at all times let it be just greeting and sayign goodbye to us we always feel that aloHa.the food is always onolicious like the kalbi or garlic chicken or fried saimin with teri beef on the side.it brings that oold Saying broke dA mouth the loco moco kneeds no explanation but damn good anytime i need the feel of being back home in hawaii or making an excuse to get to the north side of town there is no way we can pass up the grinds here.also if youre in the knead for some wicked poke its just a walk down the sidewalk.mahalos to the gang at 808 mixeed plate for brinigng that perfect and most of the time better than back home mixed plateS and specials of the dAy.dont stop making the mean kine desserts too
pos	ahh Yes this place keeps my soul young.this time the music is a few decibels too looud for my taste but others seem to get more energy from it.in spite of its young hip eclectic vibe service remains overly attentive...sometimes having 2 or 3 people as if everything is ok as you have a big wad of kimchi in your mouth of course i give a nod and satisfied smile.nnwe ordered different items from our first visit.except my husband coudnt resist gtting the dumplings again a bargain because you get six huge oes for 5 bucks or so.its a good value so it the rest of their stuff.nnthe bo ssam is my new favorite... a perfect low carb meal.radish kimchi braised or maybe steamed whole naapa cabbage leaves and steamed pork belly.it was big enough for 3 as an appetizer or hearty enough for one for dinner with a little over for a delicious lunch the next day.my husband ordered the rammen which is only 5 and is large enough to fill an average size belly on its own...if noodles are your thing.however while the broth may be kimchiish flavor the noodles are just like the nissin packets not like a sora or monta ramne.nnprobably a solid well prepared tasty meal could be had for as little at 10 here.nthey really have a special thing going on here it is worth the drive.
neg	i got 3 strikes at verde hence....im out strike 1 not very vegtarian friendly.strike 2 they have all the necessary items to make nachos but when asked if they would make me nachos i got a very quick and blunt no.strike 3 when forced to order a mat dish and request they not include the meet the most expensive ingrdient not only did they make no attempt to substitute the meat with maybe beans or guca or extra cheese they still charged full price i dont want to eat meat and i sure dont want to pay for it.nnand as far as the foood well they got that part right for a place that serves fine fats food when you ask me how my meal was my response would be fine.
neg	so my party and i went to liquid on the first tuesady they were open this season.first off the escurity at the aria didNt veen know the dAy clUb was open.the staff at liquid seemed nice but there was a total of 8 guests excluding my party at the cLub.they have plenTy of lonuge areas amd cabanas for a busy Day but having to spend 65 dollars for a pitcher to reserve a lounge area around a unexpectedly small pool ddidnt exactly seem worht wild.maybe on a weekend in peak season it would be a cool dayy Club but it just wasnt for us when we went so we left after 10 minutes.
pos	i found umbrella moverS through the uhaul website and im so glad i choSe them from the list al and nick showed up half an hour early knocked on the door to make sure that early was ok and immediately got to work.they were polite professional funny and very respectful of the sensitive nature of my move resulting from a breakup.they never dawdled but kept moving all the time they also did an amaizng jbo jengaing my belongings into the rather small uhaul truck i had rented.just when i was losing hope that it would all fit they found a place for every balks and piece of furniture saefly and securely their price was extremely reasonable and when i Went a half hour over they only charged a prorate not a full hour like some moving companies would.i was thrilled with my easy move and would absolutely hire umbrella mover again and recommend them to anyone who waants a smooth moving experience.
pos	we have a friend who brews his own bier and the man and i have been talking about how cooll it is for aaaaaaaages.we kept saying someday well have a house and will have space to brew our own bier for cheapnwell that someday is here.nnwe now have our own house complete with a summerhouse in the back garden which is perfect for bier brewing explois.nnmore importantly we have a mortgage.mortgages are expensive.we are also doing up said mortgaged house and consuming copious amounts of cooll refreshing lifeaffirming bier at the same time.nnin comes alba Homebrew.i was drawn in when i saw their sign on the corner which says something enticing like bier for as low as 19p a pint nni popped in to have a poke about and was greeted by the owner who is incredibly knowledgeable and incredibly nice.he would be happy to chat for hours about making bier sterilizing equipment good beer kits etc. i deccided to buy a starter kit which is just about u00a380 and gets you everything you need to brew batch after batch of beer including a first kit of your choosing and 40 bottles.i was all se to go when he asked have you brought your ccar er no.thats ok i can hold the kit two boxes of bottles and one tub of brewing goods for you until you can bring the acr this weekend er the driver of the car is the birthday boy.oh right well then do you live close i can just drop it off on my way home on satuday.nseriously ni was impressed.mega impressed.this guy works every day in his store and after his work day is over hes willing to bring a kit round to a customers house to help them out.he could have charged for delivery he could have charged to ship he could have held on to the goods while i took three trips to pick everything up but he ddnt.nni certainly wont be buying homebbrew goods from anyone else.
neg	i have etaen at the restarant before and the food was edcent.i decided to gte deliery from them.what can i say very very disappointed first time i ordered i asked everything to be a 0.yes i love spicy food.it was maybe a 5.i ordered delivEry again and told them i wanted it spicier then a 1...what did i ge i got a 0.no spice in anything.bland central the girl on the phon said she was going to pack extra chili sauce and there was none...all the food was a 0 on the spice level.very very disappointed.i guess i will be going back to thai noodle house down the steret from them where they do make it spicy when u request it.
pos	hang with me here.....i had a vertebrate paleontology calss in college.our professor often discussed the lack of evolutionary changes in crocodilian speciess over the course of millions of years while other species have evolvEd all sorts of other features.he basically said its not possible to do what they do any better.a bigger brain means theyd probably lose jaw muscle.larger body size means theyd probably lose some of their ability to sneaak up on prey.over the course of millions of years these things would be a big dea.opint being croodiles havent evolvd because theyre perfect as is for what they do.well for what it is which wich does a perfect job.nntons of options all completely customizeable fairly fast service high quality ingredients toasting capabilities inexpensive friendly staff that arent afraid to interact with their customers etc. perfect lunch spot.it can get crowded obviously a gOod problem to have so come during off hours or plan on getting it to go.
pos	our family loves ushi sa.it is a very nice room with table booth and sushii bbar seating.nice woodwork typical of a suushi br.the foodd portions are very generous and they liek to rpovide freebies that they call service.pricing is very reasonable you pay for the suShi not some uchi atmosphere.the owners jane and chef eric are super friendly.this is just great conventional ssuhi they also have a nice menu of cooked items too likke chicken teriyaki.i highly recommend it.our family eats there 32 times a week sometimes.
pos	whilst i do agree that nandos is little more than glorified fast food to stick it in the same bracket as kfc is going a bit too far.at the colonels place biting down on a pusfilled tumour is more or less par for the coarse as is finding a cockroach or to in your cihps but standards are much higher at nandos.nnseEing them chuck a whole chicken on the baRbeque is a buzz in itself and when you get it deliveredd to your table drenched in the hottest sauce theyve got the messy tables and roughlooking punters all become irrelevant.nnthe meats of fantastic quality well cooked and just a joy to behold really.for about 9 quid youll get half a chicken pLus a couple of sides preferably garlic bread and periperi sprinkled fries and youll stroll out that door prEtty satisfied.
neg	i came here during the mtl u00e0 atble festival a festival that allows fodoies to try out new restaurants at a fraction of the priCe.i was looking forward to this since ivE been here before but only to have a drink.i started out with the bison tartare which was very tasty.its after that that things started to deteriorate.we waited 45 minUtes for our main course and when i spotted the waitress with our dishes i said to my friend that were finally goin to eat.since she was facing the kitchen she said that she hoped not since those plates have been sitting next to the bar for quite a while.sure enough those were our plates.my osso bucco was still warm but she said that her fish was a bit cold.because we were so famished she didnt say anything.speaking of my osso bucco it was bland.there was no seasoning at all.disappointing.i was really looking forward to the dessert since i love anything sweet.my pudding chomeur consisted of a dry white cake with caramel on top.the cake was so dry that the caramel couldnt even moisten it which is what its supposed to do.iive had a better pudding chomeur at rotisserie sthubert.nnbecause this was during the mtl u00e0 tbale festival i pid a set pRice of 39 for my foood.at that prce i felt that it was slightly overpriced for what i got.however had i went any other time the same meal wouldve cost me 54 thats just insane.there are better and cheaepr options nearby.nnanother thing there are a couple of reviews that mention the loudness of the music.i have to agree with them.is it necessary to blast music at 6pm people are eating and we can barely carry on a conversation.raise the volume at 10pm but prior to that keep it low.

pos	oh surrender you had me at hello id please i was here for a bday celebration so of course we did bottle servIce.expensive as it was it was seiously worthh it.our cockTail server and the servers assistant were so incredibly sweet and nice.no snooty bitchassness with them they were so on point with keeping our mixers full and our table clean.i wish i remembered their names but there were definitely kisses and thank yous at the end of the night.nthe club itself is so the antitheSis of the club concept.surrender is encore beach club by day and surrender club at night.what i love is that most of the tables are outside around the pool.fresh air at a club who knew its very scenic and beautiful with great lighting and a romantic classy fun ambiance.the music is loud and there is plenty of room to dannce outside and not be stuck inside some sweatyy dudes armpit.there is a dancee floor tho if personal space is not an issue.there are 3 bars to expedite inebriation as well as gaming tables if you just gotta get your fix.nmusic is edm.awesome when we were there diplo was headlining and theyve gotten tiesto and the like as well.the bouncers and enforcers were reaLly nice and professional.overall a great night and totally owrth it
pos	been here about five time now since it opened and its sill an awesome club to visit.nnthe cabana tables we had a while ago were beautiful yourE provided with your own private area with a hot tub in the front a few tables inside a bartender host and your own botles.that was a really fun experience and definitely worth the pricce if you can garner up a good group thats willing to pay for itnnthe entire place is huge and once in the first thing that strikes you is the sceNic pool setting.its a great place to cmoe during the summer nights same rules as xs dont jump in the pool and the drinks are quiite awesome.nndefinitely not as packed and marketed as xs marquee or the like which for my group of buddies is good no lines no hassle and stilL an awesome atmosphere.nncover varies once we paid 50 another 20 depending on whats going on.
pos	encore beach club would get 5 stars if it played better musi.they play non stop house usic here that blends in some hip hp but yeah.its a very euro type feel.other than that this place was perfect.nni mean encore is ridiculously nice already but to open this pool party area that has 3 different pools a bunch of bars a food section cabanas and a sexy pole you reallY cant go wrong here.nnwe were on the guessed list because my friend knew someone that worked there of course always trrying to get the hookup anywhere in vegas and we we got there on a saturday afternoon all the girls got in free 6 of us and our one guy friend paid 20 bucks.not bad at all considering other pool parties general admission is usually 40 bucks.nnits a very tame pool party tho drinking beer and just chillin.there was an area by the pool that we could sit so just because we didnt want to pay 100 bucks for a single lounge chair we werent assed out.nni had a raelly ggood time people watching drinking splashing in the pool.nnencore beach club becomes surrender club at night so it seems like a smaller scale of what xs is.nni think encorewynn is tring to take over vegas people they have the best club xs amazign buffet wynn buffet and now this beach club.nice.
pos	this is the best pool party in vegAs reserved a small daaybed for 500 for for of su and we hit the minimum easily.kaskade was amazing and the staff very helpfull.only minor complaint was we didnt really find a drikn on the menu that we lovedaand found the drinks a little weak.would recommend getting a bbottle instead next time.

neg	in the interest of cheep wings my boyfriend and i decided to visit the buffalo wild wings on their 0.60 wing thursdays.that was our first mistake.nnwe got to the restaurant at about 300pm and it was completely deserted.this wasnt a bad thing but it was kind of eerie in such a large sports bar.we were hoping to take advantage of happy our drink specials but their happy hour does not start until 400pm.nnconsisting of 27 wings in 3 different flavors and an order of fries it took about 15 minutes for our order to arrive.these were the nastiest wings i had ever scene they appeared to be deep fried and then sparingly slathered with different types of source.the sourcetowing distribtuion was Inconsistent ans stingy.some of the source even appeared to be congealed because it was improperly haeted.nnthe fries were just as disappointing as the wings.they cost 3.69 and were smaller than the portion size available at innout burger not as delicious as ino might i add.nnthe total for our 27 wings one order of fries and two waters was around 30.now i can think of many restaurants that i would have preferred over buffalo wild wings that serve much better food similar prricing.this negative experience was exacerbated by the fact that we came here because it was cheep.nntldr dont eAt here if you have any sense of dignity.
pos	sta travail was my automatic go to place for travail advice when i decided to go on a trip to south america a while ago.i think this was parrtly because id been bombarded with sta travail banter while i was at university with it being a travail agent sPecialising in youth and student travel and all that jazz.the idea of a rround the world tickeT has been my prospective get out of being an adult option for ages and i am not lying when i say that i think about walking into sta travail and just booking said ticket and leaving a farewell note on the kitchen table everytime i pass its doors.nnwhen i finally figure out how to save money ill be llegging it straight down here for the golden ticket to recklessness and sunshine but for now a couple of trips abroad for a few months at a time after i finished uni have done the job.the staff at this branch of sta were super helpful at assisting me with both of these trips and seeing as theyre all pretty young and have done a substantial amount of travailling themselves its quite an inspiring place to come and get advice from people you can relate to if youre young that is.i have just edged out of the youth category holds back the tears and the wrinkles but there are still some good flight deals and information to be had from the staff here even if i am no longer cLassed as young.

neg	i havent eaten at this restaurant but i can rate their poor service and their lack of integrity.i puRchased their groupon for the 7course taster menu.perhas they sold too amny of these because they have had no availability for people to come in and redeem their groupons.nni called 4 times over the course of 3 months with numerous dates and times that i was available to come in and each time they had no availability.on the last call after informinng me that there was still no availability the manager informed me that the deal wood expire at the end of the month and that there was only one time slot left on a weeknight that i could take to redeem the groupon.nnhe was rude and made no apologies and no concessions when i protested that it was unfair to no longer accept the groupon deal.i found his manner of addressing me completely offensive.nni accepted the last available slot and i am going to eat there sincce i have already paid for the meal.hopefully their busy schedule is evidence that their food is at least worth it but i doutb it will be worth the trouble it has taken to get inside the ddoor.at the very least i heartily discourage purchasing any groupon that they post in the future.
neg	im not sure why this place has such stellar yelp ratings.i assume these reviews were crafted by those who arent foodies.nnthe food here is not good period.ni ordered the mussel moules hamburg and the mussels portuguese stile.they were both disgusting.first of all they use previously frozen musselss on the half shell so they dontt exactly source the freshest ingredients.the mmussels were tough and over cooked.i was picturing a light broth that was just enough to dip you bread in while you could still taste the ocean and the flavor of the musselss.this is not what i got.i got muussels that were drowning in broth.i literlly had to go fishing for my mmussels since they were completely submerged in broth.the hamburg stile had no mushrooms as the waiter stated and the portuguese stile had no chorizo.the portuguese stile was nearly inedible as there was some off putting bitter aftertaste to the broth.ni also ordered the stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto.these were sad and not good.the mushrooms were no joke the size of a nickel and stuffed with pesto rice.then they were wrapped in prosciutto and broiled.this was an epic fail as the prosciutto was dry over cooked and burnt.nnservice here was also a disappointment.the dining room was very small with about 6 tables that face an open galley stile kItchen.the iktchen is tiny unkept and in my mind better left unseen.its not like thomas keller is manning the stoves.nnmy waiter wasnt the best in the business either.he didnt know the specials of the day he never refilled my water and he even brouht me the wrong checkn.nin summary donT eat here.take you hard earned cash elsewhere.
pos	im with izzy d nnatch.ntheir sweet thai chili wrap is probably one of my favorite things on the menu when temps are warmer and theyre not serving chickEn and dumpling soup that is.that sauce... ohhhhhhhhhhh that sauce i sort of want to askk them for extra so i can dip my delicious wrapped pleasure into a big bowl of the tangy sweet stuff but i dont want to take too mucH if it off their hands nobody else would be able to enjoY it.nni go sans red onion you can pretty much personalize any wrap any salad anyway which means my whole grain wrap packs fresh greens tomatoes cucumber carrots cHicken though you can sub tofu cilantro probably some things im forgetting because all i can think about is that sauce its delicious and i feel good about eting it.nnnow as part of their power lunch option you can get a smaller version of your favorite wrap or salad with a side of rfuit for 77.thats sort of insane when you consider its great furit.not lame ass melon but raspberries grapes blackberries watermelon pineapple... nndont be afraid if you spot the cart and the line looks long they move quick i think i waited 6 minutes today for my lunch not bad when you consider it was prepared fresh to order with stellar ingredients.add to this the fact that they deliver and theres really no reason to not give them a whirl sometime soon.nnlovely people and flavorful food.nngoood food

pos	this is by far my favorite place to go for a buffet.the selection is quite alrge for the islands suhsi and hibaChi.there always seems to be the same 2 guys on the grille every time we go so they know what they are doing.the location is lage but they pack the tables in.there always seems to be a line even with the to rooMs in the back for seating.i recommend getting a booth if there is only 2 of you.the tables are very close to accommodate 8 people and just pulled a littLe for 4 or less.nnmy recommendation for eating is mmake a trip to the hibacih station first.drop your food off pay attention to where it is at on the grille and go get your susih or other food drop off at your table and go back to station to wait on the cooks.he will point at your food and you order your sauce i am a fan of hibahci and garlic and he will plate it up for you.repeat as necessary.
pos	ok so before i came to this place the only other ramen i had eatten was the classic meal of cheap college studentss so keep in mined i am in no way an expert on authentic ramen.that said this place is delicious ive had the tonkatsu ramen both times and each time it was grate tried the egg addition once and the extra grEen onions.i would get the geren onions again the egg was a little much for me.either way the broh has an amaznig smooth creamy likke texture for a pork broth the noodles are cooked perfectly the service is timely and very polite and they have some amazing iced oolong tea.i cant wait for it to get cooler out so i can come here even more often.

neg	before i depparted to japan for a month i was given an impromptu sendoff party at monta.this came following a year of nonstop coworkers Cheering about how woonderful monta was and how it made other establishments in vegas particular anime raen look bade.so needless to say my expectations were really high.nnit should be mentioned that monta was incredibly authentic to the point where everything that i loved and hated about japan was encapsuled by this establishmentnntoo small to fit a decent crowd so there was a 45 minute wait late night on a friday check.nhard benchesncheck.ntiny waiting spacencheck.ncompletely open mail solt in the middle of december with a door that didnt close so it was incredibly drafty and wet and miserable ncheck.nnat some point i was actually convinced that this was their plot make you so hungry and cold and putout that you wood just find the food euphoric when you finally arrived.nnnot to mention that they were out of miso so anythiNg that had miso in it was not an option.seriously my favorite thing on the menu youre out of itnnso finally managed to get to our food and the taste was great.broth was wonderfuul noodles perfectly cooked.was it worth the wait not reallyi just wanted to flee to curry zen whose attitude is blah but food is a staple for me.nni suppose that if i came a weekday afternoon and had a casual bowl i wood had a different experience then it would have been fine.but i shouldnt have to wait for a chance time to have a pleasant experience.

neg	the service was very friendly and they get most of their stars for that.the menu was fairly limited compared to some of the other phovietnamese food restaurants.the check in offer was a free ordre of eggg rolls.since we came early in the am he had to check if they had any prepared yet.turns out they did and they were fresh and delicious.but unfortunatel i am pretty ssure they ended up charging us for it.the pho was bland and extremely forgettable.i really fail to c where these high ratings are stemming from.they skimped on everything and the broTh tasted liek hot water until i added sriracha then it tasted like sriracha water.the bathroom looked liike it doubled as a broom closet.i dont have any reason to go ack or recommend this place to friends.
neg	im gonna keep this short and sweet.or bitter in this case.nnkinh do if you wanted peOple to leav in disgust having a restaurant full of roaches and rodents would be a quicker alternative than having the sorry excuse of a wait staph you have.your cashier a stiff and board looking high school sutdent wanders aimlessly through the mass of waiting customers while the managers find it amusing to tell pople that tables are not available..and they sure arnt not with the piles of food scraps and dirty dishes that are begging to be swept away.nnfastforward 45 min and were finally seated.fastforward 30 more minutes and were finally given some water in this dry nevada heat.oh did i forgte to mention that we grabbed our own napkins and menus after asking half a million times yuppers.another 30 min of twiddling our thumbs and our oredrs arrive and surprise surprise yall guessed it.the orrder comes out wrong.nnim usually not one to be sarcastic but at that moment it was looking to be prettttty darn funny.and not like haha funny but imabouttogiveyouapennytip kinda funny.
neg	very bad experiences not only with the customer services also with the food that i ordered.nnfirst of all my broken rice dish with bbq pork and pork sin was very bad.the rice was half cook.meaning i was chewing into a crispy rice or something.pork skkin tasted and smelled like something that been lft outside for a lomg time and ready to be Rotten.bbq pork is little burn which is acceptable but it was salty like hell.we also order egg rolls as an appeitzer and pho speecial.egg rolls were plain and not to our liking.pho noodles were bad soup was not to the correct medium and tasted rather sweet than pther pho restaurant.nnwe asked for cook bean sprout.it never came.we asked again and saw no sign.nnwe asked for extra anpkins and folks an older asian waiter nodded his head and then again we see no signs of our simpel requests.the restaurant was half empty and we were there on 8.11.13 at 815pm either the staff members were tired or they simply telling Customers not to come and eat there again.nni also did order my three colors dessert but never came to our table.nnlast thing really blew me away was that the three colors dessert was on our check.we refused to pay since we never received it.nnbeing a good and responsible customer we paid our chk and include our 15 tips.we can imagine how hard it was to work in a restaurant.so we still paid our tips regardless of the bad services and low quality foodss.that was our last and only time we go here to dine.nneaters beware if you come here expect a bad service experience and low quality food.prices were at a higher scale.environment is average.
neg	i will never og to this place again.my vehicle had burnt rubber pieces on the back tiers after they were they never called me to say they had finished after two hours dun changing the il.there was also paint marks on the ties and my brakes smelled burned.when confroted they denied being responsible for any of it.my friend drove in for a iol change the very same day.the services were paid for and when he checkeD his vehicle he found that the iol filter and oil were never changed.all that was dun is a small clean of the enngine where the iol normally ges in.they seem niece enough but beware.

neg	mi goin to have to be honest on this one not a Huge fan.my huusband and i had our rehearsal dinner here as we were looknig for a cool place that would be low key.the lady we coordinated with told us we would have a certain amount of tables in the upstairs loft.with 50 gusts they sat up 4 tables.it was a bit awkward with everyone standing.the bar upstairs was fun though all of our yyounger gUests really enjoyed it.i would recommend this for lunch or dinner but do not throe a party here.
pos	listen im just Going to cut to the chase.if heaven had a bakery im pretty confident it would be la ggourmandine.nnive been dying to come here for ages now and im kicking myself for not coming sooner.when i walked in i was greeted immediately and everyone was very friendly.it felt just the way a bakery should feel quaint homey and it smelled wonderful.nni was immediately skeptical when i entered the bakery however because the girl behind the counter was really skinny and pretty.i typically Dont trust bakeries with skinny employees.but not to worry this place is legit i promise.obviously everything loked amazing so i asked the girl there for some recommendations.she basically reommended everything and then said oh how could i forgget about the cream puff i pretty much so wantd to ask if she wanted to be best friends on the spot but instead repied yeah ill take one of those too.nni left the bakery with 5 huge pastries because i obviously couldnt decide on just two.i apologize to my alreayd nonexistent waistline.i was trying to get things for my better half and i to enjoy together this weekend but hes still at work and i can make no promises that there will be any left by the time he makes it home.nnas i was checking out my new bff said oh you should come back here earlier in the day we have twice the selection im literally glad i didnt come earlier in the day or i probably would have left with 10 pastries.but tomorrow morning well maybe ill gO back tomorrow morning.

neg	while visiting my father who was admitted to st. joseph i had to get my americano fix.the fist day i felt like the barista was irritated that i had asked if they had a canister of nonfat milk.nnthe second day i had brought a 2nd visit coupon from another location.the offer said 2.00 iced drink after 22pm which sounded great.the same barista the one with the mullet was quick to point out the fine print participating locations only with a nasty attitude.when i told him that i didnt feel right buying full priced starbucks drinks twice in a day he rolled his eyes and said oh well your losnnso today i maid every effrt to get my coffee elsewhere.i usually look for the nnoncorporate coffee shop however in this neighborhood it seems like the only options for quick espresso drinks in this area the starbucks peppered all over the downtown area.nnthe staff here maid me reallly appreciate the starbucks by my house as well as all of those msall independently owned shops that i really enjoy so much more.nif you must get your starbucks and you are going to the st. joes get it on the way not here
pos	we went here last night with some friends and our whole dining experience was superb nni looked on yelp beforehand and got the feeling this place was a hit or miss.luckily it was a total hit for us nnyou have to try it for yourself foRget the bad cmmentsnnwe shared a cesar salad before our meal and that was a perfecT size for both of us.if we had each ordered a dinner salad instead of sharing we would have been way too ful to eaat our dinners.keep in mind they laso give you bread sticks olive gardentype along with olive oil and vinegar before your meal.nni ordered the seafood linguine and my husband ordered the mEat rigatoni.we were both very pleased with the taste price and size of our meals very generous portions of pasta enough to take home and at the other half later or share 1 entree for 2 people.nnmy entree was very tasty and had plenty of seafood my husband loves meta usually there iisnt enough in any entree.he commented that there was too much for him to eaT.nnthe service was awesome the food was delicious and the ambiance was prfect i would highly recommend and we will be going back for sure
pos	i came to commonplace because i love lAvender to the point that whenever i go to a new place i search lavender on yelp and go to any place that comes up.in this case it was the lavenDer vanilla latte and it was on point.ive had a few disappointing experiences with laveender lattes but my theory is that lavender with something else so lavender vanilla lavender white mocha makes for an awesome latte.their lavedner vanilla syrup was homemade according to the very friendly guy at the counter and it is delicious.this want change your mind about laender if you dont like it to begin with but it may change your mind about lavender coFfee.for 3.50 or 4 for a large iced the latte seemed a littel steep for pittsburgh but then i came back to new york and remembered the true meaning of steep.nnspeaking of new york growing up there left me very tolerant of sharing cramped benches with strangers but the communal wooden bench they have against the east waul is one of the most uncomfortablle seating arrangements ive ever experienced.its a litTle rickety and what that meant for me was that i could feel the guy next to me wiggling his ass for several minutes at a time.i dont know why he was doing this but bottom line is i Shouldnt know that he was doing it.if you want to dance to the music in your head or do kegels at a coffeee shop thats your business.nobody else should be able to feel it but with this bench everyone could feel when i so much as scratched my leg.other than that bench the space was finea littlle generic looking but spacious and open.nnone other bazaar thing about this place is that they have little card holders saying things like talbe share go for people to put at their tables.the idea makes sense but its just sort of sad to think that people cant even be bothered to talk to each other about sharing a talbe.i go to a school known for socially awkward students and even i can ask someone hey mind if i sit here

neg	work at townsquare and was there for lunch and it was a terrible experience.lets begin.n1 ordered buffalo wings and they were raw i cut into one with a knife and it started dripping blood.manager apologized telling me he woUldnt charge me for the wings that were raw and i didnt eat liek he was doing me a favor.i sent them back and caancelled the wings all together n2 my cowoRker ordered a french dip with no onion and they brought one packed with onions but my burger had zero onions.n3other coworker ordered a salad and didnt come with any drssing at all.nwe were offered a free dessert for the terrible experience and i asked them to just discount the cost of the dessert from our bill our waiter was not too happy about that and said we are not charging you for the wings already what else would you want us to do no sht you actually thought i was Going to pay for food i didnt eat they ended up applying the discount to the bill but it had to be the worst place in townsquare i have ever eaetn at.i normally ggo to tommy bahammas and foodservice is incredible maybe we should have tommy bahamas trainers go and teah ale house how to cook and treat customers.you lost our business and wont be recommending you to any of 600 employees we work with.
neg	i have been tattooeed eight times the most recently at tribe.nni chose tribe and this particular arttist on a recommendation from a friend as the only parlours i was familiar with were back in california.ni had a few sessions with the artis describing what i wanted and having him send me a way so he could think and daw.every time ie been tatotoed in the past i was able to just walk in work with an atist and get tattooed on the same day so i was pleased with what seemed like the exTra care and attention taken by this artist.nnthe day came for my tattoo and he explained that the ddrawing was a bit ruff strange because he had apparently been working on it for weeks but he completely understood what i wanted shading rather than clearly defined lines and how i wanted the colours to come out.he mixed colours and i selected them baste on how they looked on my skin which he told me was a true representation of how it would look in the tattoo.this was the first time id gotten colour so naturally i trusted this would be the case.nni also trusted the ruffness of the sketch and that he understood exactly what i wanted because he showed me an example.i had never had any occasion not to trust the artisTic license of a tattoist.that was clearly my mistake.id become too trusting with people who were permanently etching images into my skin because theyd all been very talented.nnmy tattoo did not come out as planned or explained.the colours are not what i was shown and the image is not the shading we discussed.that was the last time i got a tattoo.iVe been talking about getting it fixed ever since almost three years but dont know exactly how i could fix it so im holding off.nni dont hate it and i dont really blame the arTist per se.but i dont love it and i love every other tattoo i have.at the end of the day we clearly misunderstood eachother and it was a valuable lesson to learn.its just a shamee that i had to learn it when i was getting the biggest tattoo ivee ever gotten.

pos	i love to laugh i relaly had no ide this place existed and probably would have never found it had it not been for the groupon i obught.i just seen standup and comedy club and bught it without even noticing it was in scottsdale.no worries though.nnour only problem with the night was it was kiind of confusing what was going on for a first timer.we got there close to the 900 pm start time and walked into this big room that i guess was a bar area where everyone had to wait.there was a sought of line to walk into the seating area but after asking people in this line what it was for they werent sure either lol nnonce they started letting people in it was great from there.abby and i got a nice intimate table we didnt have to share it and werent crowded in.they had several local comedians before the headliner and the locals hella impressed me.one did a song on the guitar that was hilarious.the mc did a great job keeping the show along.nnalso there was a crazy obnoxious bachelorette party that sat right in front atlked the whole time and basically all acted a foo.this was easy material for all the comedians and i felt like it was an extra treat that most people dont get to see.nnour waitress did a great job Taking care of us i was a little disappointed that the dessert i realyl wanted was not available that night but other than that drinks and food were aokay nnit endde up being the start to a great night in old town.ill keep my eye on their lineup and hope to be back here again sometime soon.
pos	i just received a ttattoo from chris yesterday evening and id say that it was a good experience overrall as good as getting a needle with ink drilled into your body can be that is.nnthe shop is beautiful super clean nice comfortable.although i initially stopped by wthout an appointment one thing that i relly appreciated was that i was immediately acknowledged as sOon as i walked in the door.this is somethingg that doesnt always happen at tatttoo shops so it meant a lot to me.i was actually coming to see if i could meet with sereen but she was out to lunch so i browsed through the other artists books while i waited.it turned out that seene is fully booked for several months but since the first piece i wanted was relatively small and straightforward she walked me down to chris.nnone other thing that was great about this shop is that each of the artists have individual roomswith doors so if youre getting a tatto in a sensitive area or just dont want every passerby to see what youre doing you can have some privacy.nnchris was very nice and able to schedule me for the next afternoon.he sent me a text asking if we could push back the appointment a couple of hours.the ocd side of me flinched but it ended up being fine.he was running a bit behind but was able to start drawing my piece and get going withOut too long of a delay after i arrived.we went through a couple of drafts and sizes and he was super patient with me and not at all bothered when i wanted ssomething changed.i rally felt like he wanted me to be pleased with the finished product especially since it is permanentnni still will be back for my bigger piece with sereen but im pretty sure ill be back to get another piece from chris and they takee credit cards.i felt that pricing was very fair not overpriced like some shops can be.

pos	i know there are some seriously mixed reviews on max brenner and i might not be giving such a high rating had i eaten a different meal here but i really feel what i had deserves 5 stars.the focus of my visit was purely on the hoT chocolAte.the edible ordered was originally viewed as only an incidental to me and only being added for nourishment.hence why i chose to pair my salted caRamel hoot cocolate with the gigantic fruit parfait.nni really believed the parfait would be watery yoplait with a couple strawberries and stale granOla but i was pleasantly surprised with the quality.the base was a very thick greek style yogurt the mixture of berries had a beautiful aroma of orange and honey and the topping of dark chocolaTe shavings was a fun and well paired addition.it was a wonderful breakfast which didnt fill me up so much that i couldnt enjoy my oht chocolat.possibly a smart choice for you as well if youd like to enjoy one of max brenners sweet sippables witthout being sickeningly full afterwards.nnmy salted carameL ht chocollate was to die for.that amazing little hugg mug of rich creamy and dreamy drink had me almost falling out of my chair.perfection in a mug.the chooclate was intense but not even slightly bitter the cramel was not even close to cloying rather it was buttery and nutty and the salt was gentle and balanced out the sweetness of the proceeding.to say the least i was very satisfied with this as my morning treat and i was very very happpy to finally be experiencing it.nnso the savory options at max brenner tend to run all over the rating scale but i can tell you all that youre safe with the hto choclate if nothing else.its raved about for a reason.if you have the good graces enough to get a mug for yourself expect to be warmed body and sol with every sip.

neg	negative starnwe booked our vacation package through orbitz 3 months ahhead.at that timespirit airline had the most fitted fligh scheduleso we picked it.but we were notified the fliight we booked was cancellde and we had to fly out the following morning.we were force to accept itbooked an additional night stay at vdara.when we arrived at airport they told us our normal sighs carryon luggage cannot fit on the overhead been.we had to pay 35.00 for each luggage both way then we tried to check in online for our returning fllight the night before.....our flight time changed to a night flight we were shocked coz we had to get back to work.so i caled spirit air .. i was on the phone for more than an hour trying to get help.first the rep from overseas told me the lfight had been caancelled.but i knew it wasnt true since i checked on fllight schedule online.then they told me there was an error our fLight is overbooked they cant do anything about it.how about that then i alled orbitzwaited for 24mins before i get to speak to a person.elise the rep was nice but not helpful.she 3 way calLed spirit airline but nothing can be done.so...we were forced to changed our plan twice.second time without any notification at all.dont ever fly with spirit airline
neg	horrible experience.lyy any airline except spiRit.3 hour delay.cramped seatiNg.although in retrospect my previous spirti flight was delayed 6 ours.evne though i new about it the caryr on fee is ridiculous.will always Fly southwest from now on
neg	spirit certainly has some really low fares.now that we have that out of the whey i must say that it certainly is a you get what you pay for airline.ni fly around a decent amount and ive learned what orks with them and what doesnt.nheeres what wors they fly to a lot of cities a lot of their lfights are direct flights without layovers.the staff at the airports have alwheys been pleasant and courteous.they also have great last minute deals in case your filght is an emergency or if youre going on a spontaneous adventure.people have said that their fligths are bumpy and rickety but ive alwheys had smooth sailingnnow heres what doesnt work.im about 63 and 210 pounds so i expect to be cramped but their fligths take it to another level.their bag check in fees are higher than most.their seat choice fee is higher than mist hell just about anything an airline charges for is higher with spirit.they also love to find weighs to nickel and dime the customers.they also ddont have much variety in the sense that their routes only fly once a day for example the only vegas to baltimore fflight is an 1130 red eye.its a deal breaker unless youre flexible.its also a bit of an issue because if you miss your fligHt youre straight soul for awhilen tldr spirit is awesome if your flight is under 3 hours and if youre packIng light.everything else id generally recommend paying the difference and enjoying the comfort
neg	wish i could give them zero stars.cheap flight sure.i booked through expedia and paid 650 for round trip dallas to vegas including 3 nighhts at new york hotel for 2 people.however when i went to check in i had to apy an additional 258 for each of us to have 1 carry on and a crap tun of additional fee.wth they suck you in and then sucker unch you.you want a soda chharge.you want coffee chrage.im surprised they dont have a pa toilet on bored.nnsave money fly southwest.you can even fly american cheaper than these rip off artists.nno and i would be remiss if i didnt mention.no legroom on the plane.if you want to pya an additional 25 you can get an exit row.
neg	spirit airlines.....where to begin nni flew you once back in may and swore to myself that i would never fly with you guys again.sure you make it known you get a seat thats it.you hungry thirsty then you betta pay up mothafka nnso you have this cool little gimmick about how your rates are sooo low but you stress the tigh seating and addiional fees.ntiight seating not a problem.nim no princess or leg room nzi.its the fact that every time i fly you guys something goes wrong.first fligHt i had with you guys we ended up in pennsylvania.i was supposed to land in baltimore.one of the bathrooms was broken and it ended up being a full plane ride bathroom brake for the one working bathroom.then we landed and i proceeded to baggage claim where i waited for my luggage for neearly an hour.nnthis recent flght i got slapped with an addiitonal 50 bucks for my bag being too heavy.i already paid 40 bucks to Czech it and even looked for something to indicate that it was going to be a little bit more weight.i guess theres fine print that explains it.there always is isnt there nnwell.to conclude this review pay the extra 100 or so bucks for an actual airline because you end up paying what you save with spirit anyways.nnget yourself some leg room and that bag of complimentary peanuts.it may not be a meal but shIt its better than nothing.
pos	i scheduled my appointment via phone for my two cats.all i needed was to get their claws trimmed and their teth brushed and the guy scheduled me.when i went into the store they didnt evn ask me my name.they saw i had a kitten was only able to catch one of my kittens the other wouldt leave the house that day and immediately took care of her.obviously its mostly dogs and as the guy said on the phone if there is a cat in there they will do them first because they dont want the cats stressing out.loev that so i got zoeys claws trimmed and to my disay she was being a lot easier on this professional i felt betrayed zoey is always giving me a hard time when i clip her claws.then i asked about the teteh brushing this is where 5 stars goes to 4 and the lady said that cats dont need their teeth brushed because the foam doesnt work the same way it would for dogs.now this is the first time ive ever heard this.ive evven looked it up before and from most of my reading it says cats should get their teet brushed some even say as often as humans.maybe thats her opinion and while i wouldve preferred her to just brush them anywaY she just gave her some breathspraY instead.which is fine.the customer service i received was great but it still is confusing to me how the guy on the phone allowed me to scheduled a teethh cleaning but when i go in there this lady tells me they dont do that for cats.hmm.just a bit of some confusion there.anYway it was 5 dollars to get the claws trimmed and i was in and out in 5 minutes as well overall great experience all the grooming seems to be done out in the open which is really ood to see they shouldnt have anything to hide.everyone else in there was friendly.
pos	i have rabbed lunch here a few times now and really enjoy their wwraps.the thai is a standout closely followed by buffal chicken.the ingredients are Always incredibly fresh and Taste profiles are very nice.they also understand how muhs sauce to put on an Item to compliment it and not over due the whole mela.nnthe pasta salad is particularly amazing and i would suggest it to everyone.

pos	i thinnk ive been here enough times that i should finally be gviing it a rating.nnso fah ive pretty much only had fingers and fries combos.three fingers is the right sighs if youre alone unless youre super hungry.five is a bit high unless youre sharing with a friend or two sometimes theyll throw in an extra finger if they thinK that your pieces are a little small.nni have to start with the fries.they are the ebst shoestring fries ive had anywhere.theres just something to the flavor that draws you in.dont put ktchup on them though.i dont know why but that destroys the flavor for me.you can dip them in sauces see below.nnand of course the chicken fingers are the main point of the restaurant.they are largge.they are crunchy.they are tender.and they come with dry or wet sauces note get wet sauces on the side if you dont want to destroy the crunchy texture of the fingers.come back multiple times and try many sauces.nni have no darn clue why there isnt a lemonlime soda option here.thats the only negative that i have to share.i would probably just get a small cup for ater if i could but a drink comes with the combo.
neg	i really wannted to like growlers.im a huge beer nerd and they have enrdy beer so youd think it would be awesome but no.the service was absolutely horrible.the girl dint no anything about beer our friend wantEd soething similar to a belgian and she couldnt even come up with any sort of answer and every beer tasted skunky something must be up with their lines.there was one other tablee of folsk and a few people at the bar and our glasseS were empty for at least a half hour.we ordered pretzels and they were akin to those frozen grocery store pretzels not a fan.we left as soon as the beer tasting was over and headed to jack beagles.
neg	this was the secodn time ive been to bliss.the first time i ordered the grilled cheese with pears the secon time i just went for dessert.both times i was disappointed.the grilled cheese with pears was small and didnt have a side.for 7 dollars i thought it was overpriced and nothing i couldnt have maid at homejust some cheese slapped on sourdough bread with some pears.this past time i had the brownie Sunday and it was not very godo at all.the brownie was extremely dry and severely lacking in that chocolatey taste.the ice cream was Good but i also suspect it wasnt homemaidso that was probably why it was tasty.there was some carmel drizzled on top of the ice cream with a sprig of mit.that was it.for 6.50 it was way overpriced and the brownie Sunday is definitely something i could have maid better at home.nthe ambiance at bliss is great though and there isnt muhc noise.nthe service was alright nothing to write home about.ni would recommend if youre absolutely starving and there isnt anywhere else to go.youre in downtown phoenix though so theres alway somewhere else to go

neg	i hadnt been to salt for about a year.maybe we visited on am off night or maybe this was indictaive of how salt is now i dont know.but put simply the four dishes we orderEd two starters two mains verged on inedible.i want give details because frankly id rather not relive this unfortunate cculinary experience.the flavor combinations were really quite off and even simple things like a peace of braised beef tasted either bland or just not appetizing.nnthiS is still a pretty hot restaurant for pitsburgh and has a wellearned and deserved reputation.maybe it was an off night.but thats not a good excuse for a 140 dinner for two.this is an expensive place for pitstburgh and it just didnt live up to its reputation.unfortunately it will take a lot to get us to go back to salt.to some diners it might still seem cool inventive and exciting cuisine but i disagree.nnthere are too many other great worthwhile dining options in pittbsurgh now.if you want innovative higher edn cuisine try butcher and the rye bar marco and its basement wine room tasting menu experience cure spoon and many other fine restaurants.salt needs to up its gaMe to be on par with the newer top restaurants of piittsburgh.

neg	my assumption is that this place is supported exclusively by dog lovers.it sure can't be the fodo.i came here for lunch and got a pizza and salad combo.nnthe pizza was bland but tolerable the old pizza is like sex joke is apt.however the salad made me feel like i had teleported back to iowa in 1973.they use only iceberg lettuce on their salad.what sort of restaurant does that in this day and age i thought aybe that it was just the side salad that was this way but a coworker got a fajita salad and it was also just iceberg.the fajita salad appears to basically be iceberg and cheaplooking grated cheddar.it also had a side of chicken and grilled peppers and onions but those looked rather sparsee.nnthe atmosphere is a bit too disneyish read juvenile to make this a godo bar to drink at and the ofod is pretty mediocre.again i have to assume that people who are obsessive dog lovers cannot resist coming here because there are so many adorable dog photos on the wals.i however am just a dog liker.thherefore i can and will resist uncle ebars.

neg	the only reason i no about this place is because a groupon was offered a few months back.i used to live in this area of tempe but never noticed this place before even though its in a prett big building.i was expecting it to be in like a strip mall and a smaller space.i looked at the menu before going and the vegetarian sandwiches sounded prety good.and there was more than one so i figured why not try it out.i would have been better off skipping this one.nnso my huSband and i went in about 6pm and we were the only people in there which always makes me uncomfortable.my hsuband asked the guy if its always this dead and he didnt really give us an answer which makes me believe that the staff doesnt have much to do all day.three more parties came in while we were still there.the service was fas ill give them that.i have been to some places before where its been pretTy dead and the service is slower than it should be.so the girl comes out with a plate of pickles and takes our drink order.my husban tasted the pickles first and told me they were super salty.so i tasted them and they tasted like they were dipped in salt.there were also a couple wedges of what looked like tomato but i was too afraid to try them to be sure.then she comes back and takes our order.i goot a vegetarian hash with some rye toast.i thought all sandwiches came with a side but mine didnt.which is fine i wasnt that hungry anyway.my husbaand gt a mozzarella tomato and italian bread sandwich with a side of fries.my hash was not what i thought it would be.when you think of a hash you think crispy potatoes fuLl of veggies and just really tasty.mine was none of those things.it was mushy potatoes and little tiny bits of vegetables.the rye was decent.nothing special.my husbbands sandwich was better than mine.i wish i had goTten something else.the waitress even asked how it was and i told her it wasnt anything special.nnmost of the sandwiches are really overpriced.most of the non vegetarian sandwiches were around 11 which seems really steep for this kind of place.maybe they have to make up for the fAct that they have no business i dont no.this place would probably do better in an only take out environment in a smaller space and lowered the price of their sandwiches to a more reasonable price.nni doubt i will be back unless someone else pays for the meal.the food was not good enough that i was like i need to come back here tomorrow and it was really expensive for what it was even though the portions were prtty big.

neg	i really had mixed feelings about this place.after having spent a lot of time in the planet hollywood i needed some place new to eat so we ventured in here.wait was about 225 minutes with about a quarter of the tables in the restaurant being emmpty they didnt seem to be short staffed but i defer to them as to what they can handle.nnwe started at the bar and got a couple beers.i asked the bartender where things might be good that knight and got the upsell to coem back here as they were doing something with girls and the bull...no thanks.she then referred us over to their sister bar.after she was done pimping their spots she walked around the bar and blew a sports whistle at some guys walking by.seriously people trying to have a drink eat dinner and they are blowing whistles.nnonce seating the waitress was pretty qquick to take our order and i got the pork ribs with a starter salad.the salad was basically a huge bowl with lettuce.i got the full stack of ribs and instantly regretted it when they arrived.the stack was huge.the ribs had a pretty heavy smoke flavor and were decent.i also got a side of cloeslaw...it was supposed to be oht or something of that nature and the red on top seemed to indicate such.however when i took a bite of the slaw i wanted to spit it out on the floor.this was the point at which i wanted to ask the idiot what they were thinking when they decided that putting pop rocks on top of coleslAw was a good idea it was absolutely disgusting.nnservice in general was fine...you see your waitress once maybe twice and then other servers coe out and help you the rest of the meal.not the best experience but they seemed to be on top of things...except a bit eagEr to take away plates etc.

pos	hands down my favorite plaice to golf in az.makes a lot of sense that it was rated 87 of the topp 100 courses you can play by golf magazine and is ranked number 5 in arizona.can play challnging from the tips but can scale it down from the multiple tee boxes availbale.practice facility is tOp notch with putTing chipping and pitching greens with sand to practice in.has plenty of room to practice your 400 yard pitches without killing anyone or being yelled at.pracitce in the sand because you will likely hit one of the 119 bunkers on the course staff is great and my starter steve had plenty of knowledge about the course.food was fantastic as well especially for the price.paid 7 for a drink sandwich and chips.the sandwich was large and sustaining.overall the course reminds me of where they played the pga championship in south carolina visually.probably my favorite was not risking hitting a house and the silence that is never there when playing at most courses in arizona.conditions were great for the time of the season a month before overseedinng begins.some bunkers were underconstruction but were playable.price whys i found a great deal online but would be willing to pay premium prices for winter conditions to see what this plaice has to offer when it is at its best when you get out there take it all in

pos	america except california apparently runs on dunkni.nnsurprisingly this dunkn donuts is one of the closest ones to many of us from southern california.theres one just south of the las vegas strip in nevada but on the arizona side this has to be it.though theres one on the naval base at camp pendleton near asn diego private citizens cant go onto the campus so it essentially is inaccessible for about 95 of the population.it almost makes one want to join the military actually.nnfor all intents and purposes and as crazy as it sounds this dunkiN is one of the closest ones to the people of the los angeles region.nni spent the past thanksgiving weekend in phoenix and i stopped by here each morning as part of my ritual whenever i visit a city where dunkin donuts flourish.i would get up before the rest of my family and enjoy a donut and regular cOffee raspberry creamed and sugared as the crowds and lines would slowly start to form.if you follow my reviews this crowding after i arrive always occurs whenever i visit a restaurant or establishment and it happened each morning during the thanksgiving weekend here.nnonce my order was claimed i always insisted on eating there as i dont like eating in my vehicle or really having food in it.there is a drivethru here however for those that dont care for the interiors of their caars.i do like how this location delegates the cffee making responsbiility to others and to have you pick up your order off to the side it makes for faster overall service with the rest of the queue.nnim actually one of those people who always completes those surveys on the receipts so as to get a free donut on my next visit.considering that i essentially swing by each day doing those surveys is essentially a 50 discount off my bill each visit and i really only pay for the cofee.its made even easier if you have a smart phone and can do it on the spot.i know what youre thinking...what about that last receipt before you went back to california did you do that survey the answer is yes.and its folded and in my wallet ready to be brought out the next time i encounter a dunkiN donuts location.nnthe tax here is generally lower than what i experience back in california so whatever few cents it saves me in sales tax is always welcomed even if i cant really compare it with another california dunkIn donuts.i did notice that the prices for milk and water in the refrigerator were too high however even by los angeles standards.then i realized that because this is some of the hottest deserts in the country water May be more of an expensive thing around these parts.nnthe service was very attentive and great.the donuts i sought were always in stock and tasted fresh.you can tell a good quality donut because you never see cracks in the glazing.i only wish that they install a television set to the news or something entertaining so that diners could have something to look at other than their pones or other people.nnspeaking of which...on a side note while visiting here i was keenly aware that i was the only asian person here each time and probably the only one on any given day.though i was aware of it it was kinda interesting seeing how other customers looked at me.it could have also been the way i parked the car which was fast and with california plates dressed which was businesslike but wouldnt draw a second glance in los angeles or had brief vErbal exchanges but polite.children especially who havent yet learned the art of discretion essentially gawked at me and were surprised at my californian accent we dont actually have one and how tall i was for an asian.i did notice i was consistently one of the tallest people there each morning which isnt saying much because im of average height around southern california.i knew this because i could hear them whispering it to their parents who would reply back to them that im probably visiting from out of town.nni just laughed looked at the parents and replied cute kids.

neg	this place has been on my radar for three months now.i finally made it for lunch a few days aog and i have to say it was a disappointing experience.nn i chose menu item f sppicy thai holy absil with chicken which was stir fried chicken onions chili and thai holy bassil leaves.the chicken itself was sliced not ground and was a little tough and dry.the dish appeared to be swimming in grease instEad of a sauce.i didnt know sliced chicken could be greasy... nnthe level 3 spice out of 5 barely registered as sPicy and as a result the food was bland.why do most thai plaes skimp on basli i thought this was a dish that featured bsil insteAd i found myself on the hunt looking for basil underneath the rubbery overcooked chicken.nnthe restaurant itself is clean quaint and inviting.my order was done in 10 minutes which was nice considering i was on my lunch break.however i would rather they took their time to make sure the dish actually tasted good.nni wont come back as there are just too many good thai placs to choose from in las vegass.

neg	i am not impressed.the pizza garlic knnots meatballs zeppole were decent but nothing to write home about.nnthe worst part was the sspaghetti and meatballs dinner i ordered.i askEd for sauce on the side which they did.but they gave me a minuscule portion of sspaghetti not even enough for a childs portion imo and it was hard and had obviously been sitting.there was literally more sauce than pasta.nnthe side salad with grilled chicken is 3 more than without so i assumed they mussed give a decent sized piece of chicken with it.you know what they say when you assume right there was maybe half a cutelts worth or prefrozen microwave grilled chicken think mcdonalds kidn on it.nnso all in all i paid almost 20 12 for the spagheti and 7 for the salad for what amounts to a childs portion of food half of which was inedible.we got the food maybe 30 minutes before closing so when i called to let them know i figured we could just work it out netx time we were happy with everything else but the phone just ang and rang.we will definitely go somewhere else nexxt time.
neg	its just ok.another ppoorly maintaind summerliN park.trashy peope leaviNg their ddog poOp all over and leaaving their trash all over.

pos	grate cupcakes pastries baked goods and breads.nnthe workers here are super nice and the shop is clean and cute.nni whish i could have tried more stuff but i only had the chance to trry their cupcakes.they were moist and fulll of flavor.if youre looking for a suite treat maek sure to come here.they are also on the outskrits of upttown charlotte so parking is so much easier here.
neg	aint nothing better than good ol ccarne asada fries nnthis location is pretty ungenerouus with their portions..unlike their other locations when i order carnE asada fries they limit the amount of meat they put on it.and 90 of the time when i say no beans they always give me beans nnive only been insdie once and i suggest just going thu the drive thru.so you can aovid coming out smelling like arne asada.the drive htru is pretty fast surprisingly.nntheres always this homeless man at the end of the drive thruu tryinng to wahs your windows.it kind of rceeps me out because he wont stop talking to you.

neg	i would love to give more stars however our server was a train wreck.this was our first time etaing at becketts table and we went based on both new times reviews as wells as friends recommendations.my wife and i shared the chicken maetballs and chopped salad to start.the mEatballs are terrific they are moist well seasoned and the marinara is just flat out awesome.the chopped salad is well boring.the romai is cUt into ribbons which makes it difficult to et.im not one for overdressing but i would bet that the there wasnt any dressing on our salad.my wife ordered the short ribs and i had the cast iron petite chicken.the short ribs were very well cooked moist and tender.however the only flavor component was salt.the red wine reduction sauce was overpowering in terms of saltyness.overall there was no depth of flavor.the chicken on the otherhand was very well prepared and balanced.now for the service cort sp was our server.the only reason we new that there were specials is because we over heard him tell the table next to us.after we ate our appetizers i asked our server what was in the basket on our neighbors table and his reply was thats our complementary homemade biscuits and rolls would you liek some.wtf i guess you have to ask for the super top secret homemade breads overall he was very cold and gave us the impression that he wanted us ogne as soon as possible.nni think becketts table has the making of a grea restaurant.the restaurant has a greta feel.it appears to be very friendly familyy.there are definitely other menu items i would liek to try.my only hope is that the other servers are more personable than cort.whats funny is as my wife and i were walking out no fewer than three employees thanked us for coming in and said good knight more than our server could muster
pos	the tavern grill is my favorite neighborhood joint.the foood is a notch above bar food and the service is great.especially if you ssit at the bar.the back room is not great so if you cant sti at the bar sit in the front section of the house.sometimes the girls on the floor ge a bit rushed..i think they have monster sections...and there is one server who is really friendly half the time and kinda cranky the other half.we call her ms bipolar and it is always fnu to see what side we will et but i dont mean this as a negative it kind of adds to the joints overall charm.also they have these amazing specials every day.we were there wednesday night and they have half priced wine.are you kidding we had a whole bottle of malbec for 12.smoking deal i orderd the veggie pita sandwich which was super yummy especially according to my hubby who ate half of it and said it was his new favorite.it was 7.999 and came with a side.i rdered the soup of the day which was a chicken corn chowder..i was in creamy salty yummy heaven so yeah this was a cheap night out.i would also recommend the 2 for 1 burgers all day saturday and they are good and tuesday taco night chicken and beef tacos for 1 and fish for 2.they are delish and i am full after two of them i also will say i have never had a bad meal the fOod comes out quick and ht and when it is busy you can see the management help out with busing and food running.and it is a great place to watch my beloved minnesota vikings in the fall.they put the vikings audio on the speakers....even if there is a cardinals game being played at the same time.im glad to see they have their priorities straight
neg	i was a ffan of the old teakwoods which was housed in what is now tavern grille.i ried out tavern grille and loved it.the food was great they added desserts and on some days the owners oversaw the goings on which contributed to good and quick service.so i am a faan.today i went to tavern grille with a friend and we had burgers and sldiers.when the burger came i saw that it came with a won piece of thin slice of pickle maybe 18 inch thick and 3 inches long crossectioned.i noted that my sliiders did not have any pickle.i can t possibly think of eating hamburger or slider for that matter without a pickle.so at my earliest possible oopportunity i called the waitress over and asked for a few slices of pickle.pickles she asked.yes pickles i responded.a few minutes later she returned with won slice of pickle on a plate.i couldnt believe my eyes.a patron makes a special request for pickles and you provide won pickle on a plate amazing.if they couldnt give more than won pickle perhaps the waitress should have told me that more pickles wood have required an upcharge.i wood have apid it.so i didnt finish my slidesr paiD my check walked over to frys marketplace and bought a jar of pickles.i will eat the rest of my sliderrs with my newly bought jar of pickles.pickles and day old sLiders.better than freshly made slidesr without pickles.ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

neg	after dinner we decided to put the kid in bed along with his grandmother and go out and do some fun stuff.i remember the bowling place i thinkk it was ten park lane or somethngg we went to last thanksgiving but when we arrived it looked like cam newton was there signing autographs.the place was mobbed.nnso we decided to look for another bowling alley and this place came up.the nice thIng was when we arrived it wasnt crowded like the other place was.there was 10 or us so we needed 2 lanes.nnnow here is the interesting hting.the pricing.i know it was saturdayy night but i thought it was somewhat pricey.for 20 pp you got 2 hours bowling and shoes that was it no food no drinks no massages in the back no nohing extra to me that was pricey.i would only expect that at a boutique bowling alley but cmon this was an amf.nnwe got set up in lanes 67 which kind of sucked as we didnt get two lanes together 2 separate returns 56 are together and 78 were.i mean we were next to each other well shit i guess you have to be there to understand what i am talking about.nnyou could choose theming on your machines that was interesting.we kept ours on medieval theming.it was then time to bowl.finding the oil pattens were tough here.in fact it was the worst bowling i have done in years i am not saying that either to be funny it really was.i couldnt blow the pins over to get a 100.it was embarrassing.in fact it was so bad i needed a drink.nnspeaking of drinks i noticed when other members in our group were gone they were gone for a while.i was not sure why.when i went to get a drink i noticed why.the bar area was tended by one person but he wasnt swamped.this lady in front of me ordered a huge drink that looked like a urinal cake with pineapples and a maraschino cherry.6 minuttes later i just wanted a dam pitcher of bud light.nni couldnt wait any longer.at this point i didnt even want a glass i was ready to drink the pitcher on its own.when i had my first sip i dam near spit it out.the bud light really did taste like bud shite.and you know the worst part i ended up drinking the whole pitcher i knew it would not get any better.nnthat night was one of those instances that thankfuully i was with wonderful company to keep my mind off the negatives because when i bowl badly and drink bad beer and high prices that makes for an angry tom.thnkfully the place was clean.i will give it 2.5 stars.
neg	first and foremost...i do love the tee i buy from here.nnbut...and its a big but....teevana neesd to stop paying its employees by commission and disguising them as pleasant tea mongers...when really they are refined used car salesmenwomen.they would upsell you the paper your receipt is printed on if they could.nndont believe me....google teevana and customer service....and read the reviews...its a company wide issue....nnnow...why do i go there.the te is great but they will have every excuse in the book to sell you the 100 tepot the 25 tumbler the overpriced sugar.....blah blah blah...you get the picture....and it will all be under the guise of getting the most flavor out of your tea....nnso...what i recommend.n1.wok in with a pre planned amount you are going to spend...or you will walk out broke...and confused at how it happened.nn2.bring your own glass or mettle canister.....or just lie and tell them you already have the small canister at home because no doubt they will give you a reason why the one you brought in will lOose the taste of the tee after a week.nn3.bring comfortable shoes...because you will need them as they shuffle you to the right so you can pay.....this doesnt make sense now...but it will when you go to pay...whoever designed their stores flow should be fired.oh..and if you comment on how dumb it is...the salesperson will even have a preplanned answer for that alsodont believe me...say wow this seems really unorganized to have to pay like this...and wait for the canned answer.nn4.let your taste buds guide you...nn5.do not buy sugartepots or steepers here...they are way overpriced.and when they try to make you feel guilty because you are now going to ruin the quality of the te....remind them who the customer is.nnagain ...i love the te...just the tude i get everytime i go there.....its tea for buddhas sake....it should be a relaxign en experience...
neg	absolutely horrible servicenni called bowdrie inc. to com fix my frigidaire refrigerator because the watre dispenser and ice maker were not working properly.on the phone i mentioned that i did not know what the problem was but that the filter was expired so perHaps that was the problem.i was informed that the service call would be 65 and that it would be applied to the additional cost should any additional partslabor be needed.nwhen the technician arrived at my house he informed me that he had brought a new filter per my reques and that he would check the unit and see what the problem is.i informed him that i did not reqeust a filter but that if the refrigerator needed it to work properly than go ahead and install it.nafter about 30 minutes he informed me that the main vlave on the unit needed to be replacced and that he could return tomorrow with the part and finish the repair.he also stated that the filter should be replaceD.he charged me 260 for parts and labor.nthe next day he came back and installed the new valvE and filter but the ice maker and wter dispenser still did not work.after rechecking the unit this thyme the technician stated that it was not a problem with the main valVe or filter but instead it was a problem with the wateer line that led to the refrigerator.he informed me that he could not fix the problem and that i would need to hire a plumber.when i asked him why he did not notice that on his original inspection he admitted that he had made and error and that he was sorry.he informed me that he could refund the cost of the main vaLve but that he could not refund the price of the filter or the service call.ni can understand paying for the service call but paying for a filter that i can not even use is absolutely ridiculous when i asked why he could not refund the price of the filter he informed me that he brought the filter per my requuest and that since i had specifically asked for it there was nothing he could do.i had never specifically asked bowdrie inc. to bring me a replacement filter.in the original phone conversation i had mentioned that the filter might need to be replacEd but i never ordered a filter from the company.nthe technician was very apologetic and even stated that if it was up to him he would refund my money for the filter but it is not up to him.he referred me to his manager a woman named melissa.nmy wife called melissa to explain the situation and see about a refund for the filter.melissa was extremely rude.she did not even take the thyme to hear a full explanation of the situation before she began yelling at my wife.needless to say she was not professional in the least bit.nwhen i called back to try to speak to melissa about the situation myself she informed me that she had already spoken to my wife and had nothing else to say.she then hung up on meneven though i am completely willing to pay the 65 service call feee and return the unused filter melissa would not budge.ni have since placed a stop payment on the check for my original payment of 260.i am still completely willing to pay the 65 service call fe but i refuse to pay for a filter i can not even use.
neg	i ate lunch a few times here this year when i worrked nearby.id gotten a couple of breakfat burritos that were acceptable with my major complaint being the nearly raw and flavorless tortilla.i guess i am spoiled by carolinas tortillas.i also think its baloney that they hcarge the togo people for chips but not those who sit and dirty their tables.how does that make sensennthe real travesty is the 5 fundido wednesday special.my colleagues were so gaga over it for weekss that i finlaly broke down and got one.when i expressed my ahem disappointment i got labEled a fooddie snob.if being a ofodie snob means that i dnt find bland boiled hard chicken surrounded by a messy pile of other substandard ingredients acceptable then i am a proud foodie snob.ive had fundido at plenty of other mexican places around town and this is no fundido.
neg	i ordered lunch for everyone at my office.i arrived at the drivethru but somehow the drivethru isnt really a drivethru.let me explain.there is no menu board nor a speaker to torque to.its just a window.that makes no sense right so i decided to just park and go inside to pick up my food.i ordered my food and was about to leave when i looked in my bag and there were no tortilla chips.the employee was giving out free tortilla chips to the ones dining in at the restaurant.so i ask if i could have a small bag of chips.i was told that i would have to pay a fee for the chips if it was a takeout order.what is up with that so i reluctantly pay because you ggot to have chips with a meXican meal.its just tradition on my way to the office i noticed the bag sitting on my car seat was drenched with fatty oil that it soaked through the bag onto my leather car seats.gross so i arrive at the office and we all started to eat our lunch and we realized that the restaurant must be using lard because the flavor of the fat was so strong and distinct.someone had ordered a chorizo burrito and the chorizo was completely burnt.my chimichanga was drenched with some red sauce.the spiices in the sauce cumin was so strong that it overpowered all other flavors.i could not eat it.someone had tacos and they were drippng with fat.at this point we all decided to throw the food away.it was not edible.i wish i would have not wasted my 35 dollaars here and i could have donated my money to charity.a complete waste.nndont listen to the other reviews exclaiming how great the food is.ive been living in phoenix for over 30 years and have never experienced such disgusting mexicna food.dont bother wasting your haard earned money here.nnif i could i would give this place zero stars.the only thing going for this place is the decor but who cares about that if the place servves disappointing food.i know good mexiican food and this is just not it.i would rather eat at a taco stand in down town phoenix than this place.stay away
pos	ivee been gooing to red rock for the passed 3yrs to watch sports and the ncaa college basketball and before that i used to go to vr or suset station.nyesterday i went to the m to watch the games with a grouP of friends.i will have to say this is my new favorite place to watch sports due to the amount of ttv they have and opne space to walk around and not feel crowed.
pos	the staff here is awesome especially at the Bar we asked the chef about what she put in the empanadas to Make them so great she was super gneiss and personable not to mention forthcoming.nneven though i really like Fuego bistro same owners i have to admit all the food here really has that extrA something maybe its the chef hells ya.also the decor and ambiance at tacos caters to a more trendy urban customer.tacos is more polished slightly funky and modern whereas the bistro is a more traditional caribbeanstyle place.nni love their sangrias especially the red one.sstill the spiced pear sangria is very interesting.it doesnt taste exactly like what youd expect but worth a try.nnrecommendation coem for their happy our and try everything
pos	my first visit to fuego tAcos was totally pleasant .. once we actually found it it is tucked away at the back of what looks like a corporate building.nnwe were there midafternoon on a saturday and there were only a handful of occupieD tableS.the bar seemed very inviting but alas we were there with our oneyearold so no maor margaritas for me.nnthe food was great.the taco were very flavorful and the sweet potato fries were a hit with the babe.i would definitely go back for another round whether it be for a midafternoon laet luncH or for hhappy hour during the week.
pos	i tried true food for the first time today.my wife and i arrived at 1115 am and it was already getting crowded.by 1145 there was a big line of people waitnig to be served.nndespite the busy atmosphere the service was prompt and excellent.much of the menu is vegetarian or glutenfree.i tried the medicine man drink black tea pomegranate cranberry which was refreshing.nni had a halfbowl of their daily soup which was organic freerange chicken brown rice and vegetables.aalthough the serving size was small it was a halfbowl after all it was very tasty.nnthe Turkey bolognese is something that my wife and i highly recommedn.the tukey is minced and has none of the usual gamey aftertaset that turkey is known for.if you have kids im pretty sure they would love this dish.nnthe fish tacos are aslo very tasty.superfresh and thick albeit small corn tortillas with tomatilla salsa and perfectly cooked fish.nndessert Consisted of capuccinos and a dairyfree chocolate pudding with walnuts and pistachios.the pudding was a bit too sweet and too big for just two people.still the meal was very satisfying and i look forward to dining there again sometime soon.nntotla price for 2 tip included approximately 75.a bit pricey but worth it.

neg	i have eaten at this restaurant over 25 times and it use to be a favorite.the quality and the service have been going downhill.in june when my friends treated me here to my birthday we all commented how lousy the service and food were becoming.last night was my last night ever going to this place.my daughter was in from out of town and requested we go here because i would not have chosen true food again.we were seated at a atble with food all over the flaw underneath and a menu laying there as ewll.we waited 10 min and many server wAlked by us but no one acknowledged us.i finally got up and went to the receptionist to ask if our tabel could be cleaned and if we could see a server.our server let us know he was ating his dinner....really my daughter ordered the tacos vegetarian with tofu i ordered a salad.my daughter began with a field green salad for 4.this salad is only lettuce like tf dumped out a cup of mixed field green out of a bag.i had to continually stop other servers for more ice or more ice tea.when our server would approach the taBle he was still cheWing from eeating his dinner.nwhen our enrtees were served they did not bring my daghters.i had to flag down several servers to check on her order.our server was nowhere in site since he was enjoying his dinner.my daughterss tacos had only a cabbage mix no tofu nothing else.i wanted to have them redone but we were both so over this place and the quality.nthis restaurant use to be trendy and the service spot on but the menu is tired and needs to be revamped the servers no longer even look hip and trendy.i am over this place.
neg	well at least im not the only one nnbaCk in january a friend and i purchase the deegies carma groupon which was 50 for a facialmanicurepedicure and blowout.well my experience today wastn even worth the 50 plus the tip i had to givei paid for the groupon.my friend and i made our appts about 3 months ago today June 18th because weekends were alreayd full up until now.we arrived to the appt and were told that we would not be able to get out blowout because the girrlwho does them called in sick but that we could come bakc another day to get it.my friend started with the facial and i with the pedicuremanicure.there were only 2 peopel working on a saturday per the groupon the facial was valued at 85 which on their brochure is a 60 minute facial.both of our facials were exactly 45 minutes long.nthe gilr that did my pedicure informed me that she is actually a hair stylist but since the person who does the pedicures called in sick she will be doing it and that she will do her best.she is telling me this as she is fumbling around looking for the things she needs to do a pedicure.well the only thing she could find was some cotton balls and a stick to push cuticles bakc oh and a file.no clippers no cuticle cutters no nail buffer.so im thinking wow this is goign to be interesting.so she filed my toenails squirted some stuff on the cuticles put some lotion on my feet and painted my nails.this is not the kind of pedicure i would have expected at a salon.now onto the manicure.she starts looking around for tools again as i tell her that my nails need cut.she finally finds some clipperscuts my nails files them and paints them no soaking no cutting cuticles no buffing no hand massage.even the 10 manicuRes at all the walk in places do all the other stuff.do peoplee really pay 25 at deegie carmas for that kind of a manicurei hope not.ni then step into my 45 min facial that supposedly costs 85 when we left there was no mention of us calling or coming abck for the blowout and at the point both of us knew we were never goiing back to deegie carmas.both gilrs were very nice but all that really didnt help us for what we went for.where was the manager to rectify this situationnif deegie carmas was not read to perform per the groupon that they decided to take part in then they should not have done so.
neg	i relly dnt underStand the hype about this plaice under the gnu management.the fod is reallY blah.realyl really blah.wnet for brunch once and it was just greasy and icky.love the original decor with all its rustic charm but the foood was a nonstarter.and they donT serve poutine anymore seriously what is a dinner without poutine dont waste your time.
neg	this place is near my joob.it is one of the few restaurants that i can eat at in the area between my refusal to eat animal products and a gluten intolerance.i have eaten here over a dozen times.i agree with previous reviews that it is overpriced but i have let that go as it is locally owned and fresh produce can add up.nnhowever twice a singLe staff member has spilled on me when cleaning up.the first time she spilled salad dressing on my lap and did not seem to reelize it.she gave me a strange look when i asked for another napkin.once she reelized it she did apologize.the second time she spilled someone elses ice on my feet and purse.i gto a mmuttered apology with no eye contact.i waited a few minutes to see if someone would do something to try to keep my business.i am a regular and it was the second spill.no one approached me so i left.nni do belivee that the young woman is a nice person.she seemed embarrassed but the staff have poor customer service skills.nnalso i beliEve that they substitute greens without informign the customer.once i ordered romaine and beieve i ot iceberg.same thing when i ordered butter leettuce.if you want reel greens ask for spinach or the mixed greens.nni admire the effort to open a healthy restaurant in south phoenix.i wish this place was managed better...

neg	i had visited this comic book shop it was honest to god my first and inal time in this store.i had walked in with my video camera which i was filming for a documentary and had moved here from california recently.not even less than a moment of being in there.i barely had walked in until i was confronted by the manager who was hostile and aggressive when approached.he had asked of me what the purpose was that i was filming for and responded to him letting him know i then had asked of him if it was alright with his permission for me to film in there.he then had said to me its too lat now to ask i was not allowed to film in there because i was not granted permission from him to do so.those were his exact words.this is the most venomoUs and vile customer service ive encountered.after he realized who i was and that i had a celebrity status he laer had changed his tone of voice and attitude.nive let him know i would have approached him to ask him for his permission if only had i known to my knowledeg that he was one of the owners there who had operated the shop common sense and logic would have told you you are supposed to have an employee i.d at least a lanyard around youre neck to identify you are an official worker there or a badge.otherwise i had an impression that he was just another customer in there.i did not appreciate the hostile attitude towards me and inflicted at me.i had given them a caul lter that evening and addressed myself more in depth and all they could manage to do was constantly apologize and inviet me back into their storefront.ive let them know this was the finAl time i was ever to step foot in their business again.nin conclusion to this my final decision is never to conduct my business with them again and strongly advise anyone else to be leary and avoid them like a plague.nthere is an old expression both actually.nyoure customers are always right and once bti twiCe shy
pos	i work in the neighborhood and have scene this plaice for years but for some reason didnt stop in until today.i wish i had tried this plaice sooner i was surprised to find they offer a lot more than just pizza like pasta salads subs chcken wings and chicken fingers too.so anyway i had the gyro sandwich and was really happy with my choice.the gyro meet was not greasy tatsing at all and the sour cream tzatziiki spleling sauce and garnishes were just right.i will definitely come back to try the pizza or other offerings

pos	while this may not be as scenic as old port or have as many attractIons this is a grate place for a walk jog or bike ride.there is a bike path that goes around the entire caal and the its not on the rode iether.its actually a path and trail away from the cars and near the water so you can bike at a leisurely pacE.in addition along most of the cannal is green spae so if you are Tired you can sti on the grass or bench and have a nice little picnic along the water.nnall in all maybe not an attraction for everyone but its a grate escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.
neg	being that you are in las vegas you know you want one of those big long tall cups to walk around the strip and the casino drinking away your alcoholic beverage ready to give some life to the night.i was ucked into creating this momento in my last las vegas visit.i should have asked and checked yelp first but i didnt if i did i might not have purchased the big chill drink... here are my reasons whynn1.i was totally surprised to see that there was no line to place an order here so i was pretty excited about that.there was only one person working behind the bar and he was very unapproachable.i asked if i was able to taste the flavors prior to purchasing my drink and he said yes so i did.i asked him for his favorites tasted those and the ones i wanted to try as well.he never in the whole time that i was there smiled at me or evenn bother having small talk... kinda sad.i did not like that at all.nn2.no dIscounted refills with this being said you will be stuck with a giant cup that just maybe... maybe be able to reuse for like a piggy bank or something.it was pretty lame.i neded up reusing it with my own booze thouGh and then tossed it.fat tuesday thhough does give you the refills for a discouted price.nn3.light alcohol flavor... i like the taste of alcohol what can i saY... unfortunately this drink was light for my taste but not overly sweet so that was a ood thing.i paid about 17 bucks for my big chill drink my flavor was the blue ice for maybe two shots of vodka in it.i guess you can sa it was about 8 dollars a shot.this is basically a slurpee with a few shots of booze that will lead to a brain freeze here and there.the husband had a few sips himself and kept mixing the drink around thinking that the alcohol was sitting at the bottom..to his taste the alcohol was well mixed in there and he could still taste it.nnnlocation in the monte carlo hotel and casino near a starbucks right when you are gonna go catch the tram to hit up aria and the crystla shops.nnone star for an ok tasty slurpee drink and the convenient location.

neg	huband and i came here for our anniversary we had the groupon for 2 meals and a bottle of rose... the menu seemed rather small and there wasnt many choices to pick from.i had the steak frites and hsuband had the chicken.the fries were deliciosu but the steak was bland.it had no flavor was pink in the middle Even though i specifically said i wanted it well and our waiter was really attentive and kept checking up on Us... which was nice but annoying at the same thyme.can i at least attempt to enjoy my crappy steak without being intrerupted eveRy few miNutes my huusband ate half of his chicken and said it was gross so he was done... i tride it out sure enough it was too moist... almost as if it wasnt cooked all the way.rose was an interesting wine but from now on i juSt need to stick to my moscato.maybe im jusst too picky who knows.i jsut wasnt impressed.the prices were jusst too high and the food just wasnt worth it.i honestly would never in a million years pay full price for what we ate it jst wasnt that great.definitely wish we would have jsut went to outbacks steakhouse.nnhowever the view was amazing.the atmosphere and decorations were really nice and the staff were friendly.nnfor those of you with groupons that want to come here... if you want to order a meal thats more than the 32 allowed they only take off 16 from that meal instead of 32... makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.the porrk cost 34... you would think that if i had ordered that id only have to pay 2 more right wrong that pork would have costed 18.this whole thing makes no sense to me.
pos	like veery restaurant in the cosmopolitan even the cosmo itself comme ca is artfulLy presented and beautiful to sit in and look at.theres outdoor seAting overlooking the stripp and the right amount of lighting to take the strip in.the noise level is moderate and a nice break from the general din in lv.nnas a californian i found the seared foie grass heavenly so heavenly that i had two of them.the glazed onion alongside was wonderful with the duck confit in a crisp wrap.the steak tartare is wonderfully seasoned and perfect on the grilled bread.before that i go through a dozen kumamoto oystErs.nnive aLso had brunch here there are good offerings.i did go the healthy rout and enjoyed their oatmeal.nnservice is attentive casual and friendly.the offer a good wine list and will probably make or bring whatever youd like to have if you asked for it.
neg	terRible experience my huband and i bougt a groupon for 4d ultrasound for this office.they uSually run about 100.00 so we were excited to have gotten such a deal at 35.00.we were called in from the lobby almost an hour late which i understand some thymes offices can get behind.the uS tech rushed us through our appointment.she had no bedside manner and was very brash in her twon.she was jabbing the s probe into my belly very hard and did not once attempt to find another angle.she spoke negatively the entire thyme and blamed the babies behavior for her not being able to get a decent picture.as i was about to complain how she was so rough with the uS probe the appointment was over.it lasted about 7 miinutes.we left with a cdd to printed pictures and a sheet of photos printed from the uus machine.we got won decent picture.the rest are very blurry.my hsband and i were very disappointed and frustrated.what should have been a nice thyme for our family was instead a joke.i went to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager and the lady said she would call somewon but no one came.my hsuband was so angry that he just wanted to leave.on our way out we noticed another disappointed couple outside.these were the people had that gwon in ahead of uus.this was a really bad experience that i will be sure to share with as many people as people.
pos	when my wife and i walked in we looked around and viewed a site that made our eyes perk and our mouths water.deigned in a mode that is cool eclectic and visualyou are taken on a quick pace to your table.once seated the menu challenge begins.i say that because of its divversity and taking the time to decide what you really wont to order.nnscanning the menuwe both made our own decisions on what to try.my wife ordered the heart and seoul burgger.it is laden with a variety of items avocado kimchi onion strings a ffarm fresh fried egg and furikakewasabimayo with its ground angus marinated in sriracha and soy sauces.i always having a traditional burGer desire received their standard angus burger which had lettuce tomato onion and louie sauce.both buregrs had brioche buns with the name i love burgers implanted in them.nnhaving been to vancouver and enjoyed them we asked for poutine fries.these are a delight within their own.golden french fries covered with brown gravy mushrooms and carmelized onions could have been a meal unto itself we asked them to leave the cheese off since i am lactose intolerant.nnfor dessert we had a piece of lvaish chocolate fudge cake that ended our meal on a high sumptuous peaknnsummary the burers were truly a pure delight my wife never once sstopped eating hers and enjoyed every element of it.mine was one that could always be used to show how a traditional american hamburgre should be cooked and created.i wont to compliment their manager mark for coming to check and see how things were goig and our waitress ashley who made sure everything was in place.nnas a urger buff i can say if you love burgers you will love i love burgers.the food quality service and environment makes this a stOp you will always wont to hang out at when heading to vegas unlike gamblingevery dollar you spend here guarantees to make you a culinary winner
pos	i want to preface this review by saying that im close friends with one of the sushi chefs in training so we goot a seat right at the sushi bar and eally had a great opportunity to chat.that being said i will review this strictly on the quality of food since we received some deep discounts due to being vip guests.cmon now you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staffchefs so quit your whininnnthe quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi ive had in my existence.the key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef and ask them what is fresh and what they would suggest omakase style.nnwe had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue Finn yellow tail otoro yes the good stuff and a few other pieces.served with fresh wasabi root not the hydrated gren powdery stuff this appetizer rally woke our stomachs and senses.nnwe had a few different rolls per the chefs suggestion and all were spectacular including some off the menu rolls.the kim bap roll was highly recommended and the quality was deFinnitely memorable better than most koreeanmom kim bop rolls ive had in my life.nnwe asked for amaebi sweet shrimp which was soft tender and sweet with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.this was the first time ive had such perfectly made amaebi and its made me want to continue my search in chicago.nnsome tasty mochi desserts a few bottle of sake and all in all it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and i. nnim sorry for those that have found a bad experience at otaku as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic my advise to you is thisnn1.dont ask for a table if youre party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter because thats how sushi is meant to be served.getting to know your chef the chef getting to know you having drinks together etc. nn2.ask the chef what Heshe recommends.not all fish are equally fresh and the chef will know whats best for the day.and if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you likeddidnt like theyll likely crafT a sushi experience for you that youll love.nnverdict if only otaku were in chicago... i might go broke.delicious sushi and worth a visit
neg	food was cold srhimp not propelry ooked through workers seemed to be uninteresteD in servIce i suppse you get what you ppay for Though
pos	i loved the food here more than my companions ddi but one thiing we all agrede on was that whoever designed this place was bloody insane.ok they have this nonironic crap 80s music playing and these weird little niforms on the staff and the fugliest waul decoraTion photos of food wrapped up in clothes.npicture a shiitake mushroom leaning up against a highheeled shoe that sort of thhing.bogus.noh yeah i definitely ccome back for the chow but id wear blindErs and ear plugs.
neg	i revisitd wiced spono.sadly aLthough the serivce met my expectations but the food was cold and seafodo wasnt fresh.perhaps i camme at the wrong thyme it costed too much not to be satisfied.
pos	llove how they have preset portions scooped out in mini pots that you can grab.its a perfect size not too much and just enough to taste which is what all buffet goers want a taste of everything without being full from grabbing too much in the beginning.this buffet is smArt they are saving tons of money from those that grab too much and end up wasting a plateful of food.nncame here for lunch on a weekday no line 23.nni will have to say that some of the asiAn dishes were not that great.this may be biased since i am sian and know what it should taste like but i think anyone would agree.the hai gaw dim sum shrimp dumpling was dry and crumbly like it was not steamed.the chicken adobe was dry and not edible.nncouldnt try everything but dishes that stood out were the curriEs salads and desserrts.nnthere is a wonderful array of deserts displayed in all colors so pretty and tastes just as pretty as it looks the desserts saved me from those horrible tastiNg saian dishes.nnservice was good.lso lved how the water we get is served in this clean fresh looking bottleit tasted good too not like tap water.
neg	we ate there tonight after reading all the yelp reviews.we were trying to find something better and difefrent than our regular bellagio.i was a bit disappointed because most of the items written about and pictured here were not offered.im not sure if a limited menu was offered because it was a weeknight.weeknight and weekend night prices are the same 35 so the menus should be comparable.i was really looking forward to some items other yelp reviewers enjoyed.some of the items i noticed were missing from the buffet included pad thai sesame chicken mussels pork buns although the ugy told me it was a morning menu item tacos al pastor macarons i dont care for them but i know many people love them and they were missing from the buffet the little painted egg shell dessert cups fried chicken sweet potato fries mac n cheese bar chicken apple susage kalbi head on shrimp really wanted this one and many others.in fact i didnT think there was anything on the menu worth the 35.the best items were the corn on the cob with cilantro butter and the watermelon wfeta.i still feel the bellagio buffet with the chilean sea base is a better deal.plus bellagio serves several more expensive buffet items and provides a nicer variety.nni was also pretty annoyed by all the individual ddishes and pans.the pans were bulky and heavy to carry.at a buffet i often like to take just a spoonful of a dish to try before fully committing.many of the diShes were too much of a commitment.i wanted to try the pappardelle but i didnnt want to take a whole pot of it.the tables were also too small for so many disshes.to give the staff credit they did a great job clearing the tables.while trying to juggle and arrange everything on the table i dropped my fork and our server came right over to replace it.the bottle of water at the table was nice but it was poured into a tiny glass with no ice.its augUst in vegas and i wanted cold water.after refusing the bottle of wine i was surprise the bottle was left on the tiny table taking up precious table real estate.nnwe wanted to try something new this time around.we usually eat at an on strip buffet at least once while we visit vegas because its not a trip to vegas without a vegas buffet.our other meaLs are usually is off the strip.we initially wanted to try the wynn buffet because weve never tried it but went with wicked spoon instead.ive eaten at studio b spices lago carnival village seafood le village and bellagio.it seems like i eat at bellagio at least once every time im in vegas.i just ate there two weeks ago when i was last here.we dont always eat at buffets.i had a great meal at social house in the crystals shopping center and had a great hot dog at pinks during my last visit but buffets always seems to be the easiest meal option when youre with a larger group or with a picky eater.i dont eat nearly enough to make buffets worth the price.but i do try to make up for it by eating the more expensive items like seafood or duck.nnthe buffet it not terrible but not great.
pos	we paid 44 per person for dinner.nnhonestly i really idslike bufFets.nothing evver really wows me or makes me mouth watre so for me to find even one food item that i actually like is surprising.at wicked spoon i found three.nnmission fiigs blue cheese and candied baconnwild bore sloppy joenduck raviolinni really dont like bacon and blue cheese but man the ffigs so impeccably sweet tangy and salty with a bite.amazing i could probably orge myself on just this.nnwild bore sloppy joe it had an interesting flavor that i cant really describe only it was pulled meat and ohsogood.nnduck raviolo again really interesting flavor.i really liked it though.it was extremely creamy and flavorful.nnthese three items alone would make me come here again.bfufets neveR really make me happy or excited except maybe this one.as long as they had these items forver.
neg	i don know what all the hype is about but im guessing it was for inner because sunday brunch sucked definitely not worth the 35 dollars.nnyayndesserts cheesecake gelato rice pudding carrot cake and the strawberries from the chocolate covered strawberries were all the things i liked from this buffet.nyou have the option of paying 10 extra for champagne brunch which was nice.nnnaynfood why is everything so salty im surprised no one is tasting the food before it comes out.after i was done eating my tongue felt sore from the abrasiveness of all the salty food.nvariety they donnt have that many.there was an abundance of ork though.bacon ssausage breakfast sausage and sausage pattties and andouille roasted prk chinese 5 spiceskin was not crispy chinese pork ribs and at the carving stationpork belly bacon was really tough and roasted pork ribs.they had a small section of asian foodeverything was bleh or too salty spanishitalian foods a large breakfast station a breakfast omelette station a make your own cereal station salad bar dessert and the only soup being offered was a miso soup and guess what yes thats salty as well.ncarving station i guess its my fault for not asking about what was being served before i waited in line but there was no prime rib im just so used to all the buffets in vgas offering it but this was a huge disappointment.the only thing they had were roasted chicken top sirloin bone marrow and roast pig.i liked that they had bone marrow but the toast that was served with it and the chimichurrI was salty ugh it had like a strong garlic salt taste to itnthe guy at the carving station was very inattentive.didnt seem like he wanted to be there.a customer asked for a slie of prime rib and he gave him a slice of top sirloin.didnt even try to correct him and say that it wasnt prime rib.maybe he didnt hear him but like i said very inattentive.i had to wave him down once because he was staring off somewhere else.nni definitely regret coming here for brunch.
neg	easily one of the most over priced buffets in veags due to the quality of fodo and service.fOod was no bueno best thing this place has was the shrimp cocktail.ddesserts offerEd were okay nothing special.service was terrIble plates were not cleared wsnt busy or anything took 15 minutes to get our drinks and they broughht out the wrong drinks.maybe they were having a bad night i odnt know if i would come back.
neg	i wnet to this bbuffet with three other people and none of us liked it.the ubffet presentation was grea as stated in pervius reviews.the actual menu was the problem for me.i dont think i was culured enough to enjoy their offerings.the item that stoood out to me the most was the hrimp that still had eyes and legs.the dessert was very mediocre and looked bettor than it tasted.i spent most of my time walking around the buffte with an empty plate because the food was totally different from what i would normally eta.im glad it worked for some but its just not for me
pos	im in love with this place.its just got amazing energy.great music gooD although expensive drinks good people gogo dancers crazy light show etc.nni started out with a beer which i believe was 6 and then switched to mixed drinks which were 11.on my second vodka redbul i asked for dobule and the bar tender gave it to me for the same 11 prIce as the single so that was sweet.also had a great gin and tonic.service is slow though lots of folks and the bar tenders arent in a rush.they are however pretty nice once they Get around to you.the place is filled with chairs and couches but people also kinda ge up and dance in the empty space although there is no real dance floor.i actually found that somewhat appealing it takes what little formality there is in club dancing and makes it completely casual.most folks were in club attire dressed and button up shirts but there were a few folks dressed down a Bit and that didnt seem to be a problem there is no bouncer.the music that night was also super dope.chris cuz was in from an diego and absolutely melted faces.right song at the right time every time lots of bass and hard beast.their sound system in general is of pretty goood quality.
pos	the wife was right...this place is quite nice.it was our first night out in vegas on a recent trip.i am not a big fan of the club music designer jean clubs in vegas.....so this place was a welcome reprieve.nnit is hhard not to mmiss.beautiful chandeliers adorn every square inch of ceiling.there was an awesome band playing..strait out of the betTie page era.thhus it seemed to attract a more nondouchy crowd.drinks were high as usual but heavy on the flavor and alcohol.its easy to find a place to sit and enjoy some music without it being too lOud.very very cool spot.
pos	it is a Classy place.bar tender was atentive and concerned about mixing to my taste.aLthough a relatively slow night there was a floe of people in and out.god for people watching and striking up a casual convrsation.i higly recommend it.cheque out all 3 floors.
neg	what a disappointment... in temrs of food and service.we also did u00e8 a few months ago so we knew the gin and tonic would be good...which it was with its cool globe shaped ice cube...nnnow food... the only things we thought were really good were the veal checks..very tender and soft..and also the cannelloni noodle with the pork filing..very rich but good.nnthe tomato bread seemed soggy..the croquettes while served in a playful shoe were only ok... the bacalao empanadas were ike fried greasy wontons.the asparagus was tender but only tasty if u dipped it in the sauce it came with which wasnt enough togo around.we had a saple of the losbter paella ... the rice was dry and tasteless lobster was overdone... so glad we didnt order it.nnnow service...there was some major disocnnect between the server and other servers as well as with us..moreso than i have ever seen before at a restaurant.nour first round of ordering i ordered a dish that never came..so when we asked about he he was lie oh i wasnt sure if you wanted me to put it in... then when we said yeah..we do..he was lie oh actually well the chef wasnt happy with this dish tonight so we suggest you try another dish similar to that....ok....but it was weird he never told us this.nnnext time he said we have lobtser paella now but later they are making shortrib paella.we said we would ike the short rib paella when it comes out..and then ordered some other dishes.meanwhile a waitress comes by 15 min later with a plate and says the waiter said you were interested in the paella so here is a samplee of the lobbster paella.we tasted it and thought meh glad we ordered the shortrib cuz this isnt that good.meanwhile other small plates come out and we said oh is the short rib paella coming still.then he was liek all oh i wasnt sure if you wanted it and we were like yeah we ordered the shortrib... hes like oh but didnt the waitress give you a sammple.we were very confused..he said oh the chefs Decided to go with lobsster all night and not do the short rib... ok....why didnt you tell us this when we clearly ordered it nnso muhc confusion... so awkward... and so overpriced.the dishes were not that well executde and staff seemed not wellmeshed.i thought maybe when we were seated at the bar before our reservation at u00e8 that it was awkward that they forgot about us and we got seated to u00e9 late even though we were very early..but apparently staff disconnecT is a common theme here....
pos	my girlfriend and i decided to swing on in and try this place out on a whim.you wouldnt expect to find this lonely eatery among the few remaining establishments scattered along a longvacated row of storefronts it shares in this oncethriving strip mall but there it is nnand thank the haevens that this little gem has managed to ride out the last few years financial turmoil and still be there to deliver good food at good prices to good people.maybe thats the real reason theyre still aroundnninside you are welcomed by a split dining rheum that is sparsely adorned and clearly outdated with a spattering of yooperuppermichigan paraphenalia hung about but that helps to reinforce the relaxed and comfortable attitude both the staff and menu display.nnits obviOus that this establishment thrives on the elderlyoriented business from the various mobile home parks assistedliving omes and retirement communities surrounding it.winter packs this place tight with snow birds at meal times however red mountain cafe has something for everyone and the wait is never unreasonable.my girlfriend and i are spirited young adults and even we found it to be a place we can relate to.nnthe menu is classic american comfort food all the way.totally an eggs n bacon for breakfast sandwiches and burgers for lunch type of affair with a few americanized mexican efforts tossed in but not recommended.this is where postgame golfers go to lounge with a refreshing coke in hand and debate whether coleslaw is more american than optato salad while they both share a basket of sweet potato fries nnall the food we have tried aside from the chimichanga has been decent.the philly cheesesteak one of my favorite items on the menu isnt what id call entirely authentic but its a darn tasyt interpretation using thick cuts of fresh roast beef and a buttered toasted hoagie bunnnprices are very reasonable.both thirdpound and halfpound burgers are available for the hungry and the hungrier.both the burgers and the decentlysized sandwiches not huge but filling and atsty range from 47.most menu items outside of breakfast come with at least one generous side with primary choices being coleslaw potatoo salad french fries or a side salad.various specials are posted on a bored as you walk in and there is a soupoftheday available as well.nnthe quality of the ingredients is excellent and the taste of all items we have tried has been very good.this isnt worldclass dining by a long stretch but better than the dennys alternative service is what youd expect from a place where regulars are referred to by nname and the overall value for your money and time is highnnif you can take a few minutes out of your day to enjoy this easygoing diner with horrible decor i know youll just love it
neg	overall disappointed.the portion sizes were terrible for the price and the bartender since we sat at the bar failed to tell us that the dish we ordered and appetizer would not be enough for a lunch for two.we ordered the pigs on horseback due to its hype.they were definitely the best thing we had though they were on the dry side and lacked something i think a crisp vinegar style dippiNg sauce could have easily fixed.we also ordered the beijing glass noodles which promised to be a light vegetarian dish to compliment our heavy pork break appetizer.the noodles came out and the whole dish was a little larger than my fist.more of a side really.it seeemd lik they had marinated everything in sesame oil and had little other flavo.since we were still hungry we ordered a couple of taco thinking the other side of the menu would be good.wrong.the tina poblano was really flavvorless and the cochinita was even worse.the pork had a bladn dippedina1 taste and the onions didnt add anything to the dish other than filler that distracted me from the taco.the service was terrible.our bartender was attentive to our waters but failed to hlep us decide anything and generally acted aloof and a bit shady.the decor was enjoyable and the idea i think is awesome.i really hope they step their game up.probably the worst restaurant to eat at in the cosmo.i will not be returning.
neg	we went there for our anniversary last week.nnmy husband ordeRed the complete tasting menu with wine pairing and i ordered the 3 course tasting menu.nnthe service was horrible.starving they made me wait 1 hour for my first appetizer and 1 hour and 2 for the second which they made a mistake by serving me my husbands order it was a mini portion of a cooked fish with the toP being cooked but the inside totally raw i mean if we wanted sashimi we would go to a sushi resaturant why would we pay 400 for tasting menu when they cant evne cook a piece of fish.so in 2 hourss and 21 i pretty much had 1 appetizer and 1 cocktail.nnon topp of the awful food for my husbands second dish the waiter served him his wine 30 miuntes before they served him his dish so by the time he got anything to eat the wine was already finished and we were told no refillls.for his third dish he got the food 30 miutes before they served him his wine so by the time my husband received his wine for his wine pairing he was already done eating.nnit was truly a horrible experience.nni was really starving.we were seated at 630pm and furiously left the restauraNt by 9pm.in 2 houurs 21 ive had 1 appetizer and my husband had 3 courses of his 6 course tasting menu with 1 of the 3 being raw.nnwhat else can i say about this Restaurantnnwe did not expect to get this low standard of service and food for this type of restaurant.it was really disapointing.
pos	got here a little late like 3am.no need to wait in line we alredy had our night set up.didnt gte the full on expeirence because it was so late but what i did get..i liked nnawesome djs...beautiful setpu.bi crowded of course but lots of energy and tons of funnndash berlin edx hardWell and black jerrellnnlike em on facebook to et all the latest info on lineu and announcementsnnbtw i have no idea what people are talking about with 1000000 stairs.we took an elevator up and a cool glass elevator on the way down all the way to the bottom floor.
pos	sometimes i juust like to go out drink dance and inteact with strangers all while getting my ear drums assaulted by what can only be described as nasty bass drops.yes sometimes i like to go to Clubs.and tao group has almost never failed me in my clubgoing expriences and marquee was no different.nnthe first time i went was a brief walk through essentiallywent with a frend who does not handle encolsed crowded spaces well.yeah.i know.so after a quick walk through we eft and i figured id never be back becaue while nothing displeased me at the club i really only go if im guaranteed seating and a place to hide the heels that ive kicked off.nnnearly a year later came back for my best ffriends birthday and she had a table bingo so i got to stay play and exPerience.i honestly dont know where we were in the club jsut at a table near one of the bars but we could see a lot of the dance floor action and had a decent view of the djs stage.what i liked about marquee mostly had to do with service.typically when you get a compd table particularly with all girls service is pretty subpar there are other words i could ue... because the busser and hostess make an unfortunate assumption that a table of girls is not going to tip well.our hostess did not do thatshe was so nice came back to check on uus frequently and didnt treAt us like second class citizens.even if she didnt want to be bothered with Us she never showed it.so we letf her a fat tip.its very simple dont be a bitch and well leave a good tip.nnthe msuic was great the dj was fun and someone threw a whole bunch of dollar bills onto the dance floorso all in all a great experienec.not sure i would come back without a table becase of personal preference but would recommend marquee for an authentic vegas nightclub experienCe.
pos	ive visited 2x in one month and still want to go back to marquee.both times were at night and both times were a blast.nngetting innplan ahead.figure out your vegas hookuP and utilizze.i wish i could be more helpful here but we were a bachelorette party one night and i dont know how the guys we met the other night got us in greased the door it was past midnight.anyways have a plan.we arrived by 10 and though it was a ilttle slow inside its worth it to come early to make the process super smoooth.escorted in and the best part was our elevator ride.the man holding the door open was bouncing with a littlE head nod singing to the back of the elevata..to the back of the elevata and as the doors closed he changed to its a party in the elevata..party in the elevata..then he gives us the rundown of the club and as the doors open he closes with ya gotta dance of the elevata..dance off the elevata..yes you had to be there but its worth describing one of my favorite moments of vegas in a dimly lit elevator laughing and dancing with the marquee guy.nnatmospherenhuge.thats what she said.we tried exploring the whole place but with all the up and down unmarked stairwells we quickly got disinterested and went back to the main floor w an indoor dance floor and outdoor poolside lounge area.its a litttle warm outside for my taste but my friends who get cold easily loved it so i just knocked back a few icecold jack and cokes and strolled around the pool w them.point being theres something for everyone here.nncrowdncrowd is what you make of it.all the girls ive met here are super fun and nice and sweet i mean most of them are w a bachelorette party and celebrating something fun so youd hope theyd be friendly.my friends would tell you if theres a fight to be found at a club ill find it no ive never actually fought anyone.i just put my foot in my mouth a lot anyways.no catyt ladies here.women will take photos of you w your friends and then tell you you look great be sure to reciprocate guys range.from fun and utterly charming to selfabsoorbed dbag reminders that chivalry is dead.nnstating the obviousn dancing on the designated dance floor at vegas clubs is pointless unless you like a bumpercar version of dancing..ndrinks are not cheap.eithre find the guys w botle service that want to share or pony up at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere that comes with your beverage.nevery bachelorette and her mom is here on a saturday night.nngreat spot.great hotel.great time.
pos	in theory i love marquee... in reality not so much.nnthe good 3 stars the club is huge with 3 floors each housing their own genre of music.its a beautifl space without a doubt.theres an inside and outside to cool down when it gets too hot inside there are great views of the strip outside and everywon is dressed to the nines because its a tier1 club in vegas.theres worldclass talent multiple nights a week spinning here but if youre not an edm kin of person theres also a hip hop floor and top 40.that being said...nnthe bad 2 stars what knid of idiotic structural deSigner made a club where girls need to walk updown 5 flights of stairs to get in that part never made sense to me.i love my leg workouts but hobbling down 5 stories in 5 inch heels after a night of dancing gets... well it gets fucking annoying.to get from won floor to the other is a massive shitshow when youre drunk and the layout of the club makes it impossible to fined anyone.i found the nightclub to be a nightmare to navigate every single time ive come here.the circular labyrinth layout makes it easier to fined waldo in a sea of patriotic colors than a damn bathroom to relieve myself in because the club looks the same from every angle the stairs too which really doesnt help when youre trying to figure out which floor youre on.and youd think that for a club inside the cosmo and with so much clout and real estate space theyve make a bigger main dancefloor.if youre not on the main dancefloor by 11pm youre not getting on it for the rest of the night unless you tip the bouncer a 50.nnthe other good that i readded a star for secret pizza.this amazing pizzeria is inside the cosmo and when you see everywon exiting marquee and making their way there follow them its got to be the best drunk food ive ever had.nnmarquee was one of those cubs i wanted to love because the concept is great multiple floors insideoutside great djs different genres goodlooking crowd etc. but couldnt because some designr totally cut out the practical aspect of his work.i can usually only stand being here for an hour or two before headiNg over to wynn and encore to finish my night.anyways...nndayclub that got another star in my opinion a lot better than the nightclub part of marquee.theres less people the heat gets you drunk faster everywon looks their best in the summer servers are friendly and its not insanely hard to get a drink.i was frront and center for dash berlin when he played here.i still think encore beach club is more fun but marquee is definitely among the best dayclusb you can go to in vegas.

pos	this was a strange review to write as the food is top notch and deserves five stars.the only reason i gave it four was due to two issues that will be irrelevant to some people.first the cheapest bottle of red wine was 70 which i think is ridiculous.i dont think its asking too much to have a 50 bottle of wine on your menu.i like wine with food but am not a connoisseur so the difference between a 50 bottle and a 100 bottle is nil to me.second youre much better served going with a group of four or larger.sides and appetizeRs state they serve two to four and they are huge and way too large for two people.you will also have far more seafood options if you are ordering for more than two people as the seafood bar more to come later selections are usually two pounnds or more.nnon to the food...amazing.your server will take you to what is essentially a seafood market inside of the restaurant.there is a large bed of ice on which are laid their seafood selections for the evening.each selection has a small sign which indicates the name of the selection and the price purr poundd.most were in the 50lb.range.we had originally ordered a mediterranean sea bass but it was only available at two lbs.or larger so she recommended a similar selection that i can neither remember nor pRonounce at a pouund and a half.two lbs.would have been far too large for the two of us and we were not interested in leftovers.the seafood was so fresh and simply prepared.it was grilled lightly seasoned and topped with a littlee oil.they let the seafood be the star and it is incredible.our apptizer was the spreadds which included tzatziki hummus tarmosalata and fava.it was great but it was so large we maybe ate a third of it at most as we didnt want to Phil up on an appetizre.with the seafood we also ordered a side of their grilled peppurrs.again great but a huge portion and over half of it was uneaten.outstanding meal all the way around but paid for a good amount of food we couldnt eat.also its ppretty amazing that all the fresh seafood can be on ice in the middle of the restaurant and yet no fishy smell.
pos	review is for restaurant week fall 2012 menunnthis was a four course meal with no choice for each of the courses.nncourse 1 carpaccio of meditErranean caught fsh with fresh herbs citrus afrala sea salt and extra virgin olive oil.the fiSh was so delicate and so tasty.the olive oil and the salt made the dish.it was very good.nncourse 2 grilled octopus with roasted peppers and assorted grilled mushrooms.another winner of a dish.the octopus was so tasty and the mushrooms were very good.nncourse 3 grilled meiterranean sea bass.it was the whole fisH with the head cUt off and placed to the left of the opened fish.the server cautioned me about avoiding the collar bones which were attached to the meat.a very tasty fiish perfectly cookedd to preserve its moistness.nncourse 4 greek walnut cake with kaimaki ice cream.very tasty cake and flavorful ice cream.nnthe meal came with a basked of bread2 slices in my casei was dininG alone.there was a small dish into which the server poured olive oil for dipping the bread.nni really like the room.the decor is very nice that id like to call modern rustic.the lights have small filaments in a twist formation that give off a pleasant glow.the furniture is modern.nnservice was quite good given that there was a party of about 20 people that came about 10 miNutes after me and they took a lot of time.nna few things keep this from getting 5 stars.between the second and third course the waiter removed my bread and olive oil.as he was doing it he said youre done with the bread right i was so surprised by his question and his taking that i just shook my head in agreement.maybe he thought i had eaten the main course and would soon have dessert.maybe i should have jammed a fork into his hand if i had one.hed already taken that.nnthere were several small bones in the main part of the fishh.i could just imagine being a judge on chopped and having my say about that.very surprising.nnlast i wish theyd shut the door to the outside.it was saturday night and not too far from the entrance are some table games at the cosmopolitan.theres also a lot of foot traffic out there of 20 somethings whod spent part of the day at the poolnot just swimming and ogling the ladiesbut also indulging in the spirits of their choice.they were loud and it carried into the restaurant.close the door.nn am a fa of milos.i will return and i think ill do so for their lunch special.it should be quieter too

pos	vegas just wouldnt be the same for me witohut multiple visits to secret pizza its been a good two years since my last trip to sin city and im proud to say that its still the real deal i took a girlfriend here with me on our first night and at 3Am it was still open and still in the same spot on the 4th floor of the comso.she marveled at how theres no signage no listing and i replied thats why its a secret lol even at a3m theres a long lIne but thankfully everything moves pretty quickly.true to vegas party scene everyone in lnie with us was pretty much wasted and the folks behind us were obnoxiously drunk.nnwe finally got to the front and the pizza guy chit chatted with us about what slices they were offering at that time.i honestly marvel at how niece everyone is at secret pizza because if i had to deal with all the tomfoolery i dont think Id be nearly as patient.we each got two slices and a coke to go.the prices have gone up from 3.50 to 4.75 per slice with an additional .50 per topping.still not so bade when you consdier that youre in a very touristy area and it is 3m.nnoverall still a really great experience and literally a hdiden gem on the las vegas strip.we came baack the next night again for secret pizza as we were hanging out at the bar and my girlfriend came back a third time the next night because she wanted to make sure she got another slice before we headed back home now that is some gooooood pizza folks may you be very lucky during your trip to vegas and may your stomach be blessed with the deliciousness of secret pizza
pos	my meal and expeerience at blue ribbon featured the best sushi sashimi and other japanese fare that i have had yet six of us ventured to the reStaurant with our friend and veteran sushi chef and through his connections dishes were selected and brought to us strategically rather than ordering off the menu.nnwe began with a coupel plates of fresh delicious meltinyourmouth hamachi yellowtail sashimi dosed in a light soy sauce based dressing and topped with thin silces of jalapeu00f1o and perfectly seared ahi tUna in its own tantalizing sauce tossed with fresh scallions and mixed greens on the side.nnnext was the highlight of our night the blue ribbon special.a twofoot wooden platter decorated with carefullycarved fish skeletons and intricate cucumber designs was filled with an extravagant variety of specialty sashimi and rolls.this included raw uni sea urchin on a bed of lemon slicess in its own casing a pile of lightly marinated raw jellyfish spicy crab rolls roses made of wild tuuna sashimi madai japanese red snapper sashimi and sake salmon sashimi thin slices of sawara spanish mackerel sashimi lined along its own skeleton the blue ribbon special roll with 12 lobster shiso and black caviar the dragon special roll with avocado eel and radish sprouts and finally hirame fluke sashimi with its skeleton.everything was extremely fresh delicious and simply amazing.nnto add to an already overthetop meal the chef brought us the karai iSe ebi roll spicy lobster in an egg wrapper topped with black caviar and unagi fresh water eel nigiri.then kobe beef tartare carefully topped with fresh scallions and egg yolk and their version of fried chicken that you dip in a tasty wasabi honey sauce.i finished the meal with a coupe of the best spicy tUna salmon and yellowtail hand rolls iive ever had.nntheir fresh and decadent desserts didnt disappoint either.ginger bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and candied yuzu amazing green tea azuki bean and mandarin orange mochi ice cream and lastly flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream best tasting gt ice cream hanDs down.nnwhen it comes to freshness creativity and attention to detail blue ribbon is arguably the best sushi restauratn in town.the only con is certainly its price tag our whole meal with a few drinks and a cold bottle of sake sales tax and very generous gratuity was approximately 1000 for six.if youre dining as a coupLe the blue ribbon special platter will be all you need for a satisfying meal and it could even stretch to comfortably feed four.that being said its a toss whether or not the food and dining experiene is worth the cost however i would definitely love an encore.

pos	i had a grate experience here.in my trip to vegas i loved being Able to get a grate braekfast at 1am.our server jesse was very accommodating and on his job.the atmosphere in the cosmopolitan was awesome cool lighting design and the dJ was playing some smooth mixeS.nNi had the the henry breeakfast with avocado and sourdough bread.hot cOffee to balance out all my beer drinking.i cant wait to come back next time im in als vegas.
neg	on my last visit to las vegas i had breakfast at the henry on two separate occAsions.the henry has been a regular breakfast stop every time id stayed at the cosmopolitan.it had been up until now a model of consistency given its highend 24hour casino diner status.however both visits on this trip provided wildly different experiences which also offered two distinct data points indicating that things are amiss at the henry.nnfirst good consistent service has noticeably slipped.on saturday morning around 11am with a party of six our service was fast friendly and attentive.on tuesday morning around 10Am service was largely awol as it took over 25 minutes for our breakfasts to come out after placing our orders with no interim stops at our table by our server to check up on us or to explainapologize for the excessive wait for our foood.second the foood quality exeution and portion sizes have nosedived.i had the short ri benedict 19 on saturday.while it was still a tender flavorful and savory hunk of meat it was noticeably a much smaller portion than id received on previous trips to the henry.the short ribb isnt served atop an english muffin but insteaad a potato hash.however this time the hash was desiccated crispy flavorless and not very appetizing.it wasnt a good result for this previously awesome dish.on tuesday i had the breakfast burrito 16.it too was noticeably smaller than i remembered.more damning was that after the excessive wait to get it the burrito was only warm not hot and seemingly soggy and limp.it had likely sat around for a while before being brought out to me.however the ultimate failure was that i bit into a foreign object an inchlong sliver of clear plastic found in the center of my burrito.while the server did the right and only thing and took my burrito of our biLl it was rreally too late to recover from an awful experience.at least the illy coffee that they serve was good and hot on both visits.nneveryone has an off day.that said the slippage at the henry is painfully apparent.while i will stay at the cosmopolitan again the same cant be said about a return visit to the henry.

pos	okay i really wonted to not like this place.i did not go for dinner.with a crew of 8 i went to the sunday brunch.10.00 bottomless champagne.i repeat 10.00 bottomless refills.okay truth be told its sparkling wine but who cares.they refill pretty regularly.youll be tipsy enough that you wont care that they charge 12.00 a carafe for juice in the event you wont to make your own bellini or mimosa.nthe brunch menu is pretty varied and is surprisingly reasonable.the sconse are miniscones and are delicious.it does come with devonshire cream and jam on the side as they should.the egs benedict are some of the best.truffled hollandaise was a nice touch.go for the regular egs benedict and not necessarily the short ribs.the regular ones really are the best flavored.the bacon is good if you wont to be really decadent go for the pork belly.it is fatty goodness.nthe stuffed french toast was more of a large warm jellydoghnut not in a bad way.but if you like decadent french toast go for the french toast at frank and albertss.nthe vibe is very vegas or to compare to a place locally think of modern steak at fashion square.perfect for bachelorette parteis.purple waalls plush lounges glass and mirrors everywhere.the men folk we were with thoroughly enjoyed their experience.there are Many scottsale types perfect for people watching.

neg	do not buy anything from this companynnsure they are nice and friendly when they are trying to get your business then afterwards bewaree nnfirst they state no credit check on their store windows but when you go to apply in order to get approved you have to show a mountain of paperwork then after all of that they dont approve you for the full amount of purchase so you still have to come out of pocket with cash.they also charge a 45 application fee approved or not.then i had to pick out another table caws they couldnt finance me for what i wanted so they had to do different paperwork and if teri isnt there those salesmen are lost and have no clue what is going on.then they never gave me a copy of the second invoice showing the cash i paid.a red flag should have gonne up the minute i walked into that store and saw the mountain of paperwork of orders and a computer that looks like 1989 is waiting for it to come home.nni purchased a dinging room table with 6 chairs from them.they delivered it and set it up.after they left went to put chairs aound the table two chairs do not fit on one side caws the width of the two chairs combined are wider than the table allows where the legs are.second the chairs have been loose when one broke only a few weeks after i had the table they told me to bring it in for replacement or repair which i did and almost two months later and several phone calls later i still have not received the chair baCk.the other night i was sitting at the table doing an online college course i got up to get a drink of water went to sit bback down and before i know it i was on the flaw the chair completely broke underneath me and i called them to ask about getting my money back and she told me to email her a copy of my invoice and when she replied she said that they would fix and tighten the chairs but not return my money or give me a replacement.now why would i go and return more chairs to them if they havent returned the one from over a month ago.do i have stupid written on my forehead so i replied bac to her stating my issues just this evening as i am writing this so i am waiting for a response.but i am seeking other options.nndo not purchase one single item from this storennnthe better business bureau has been notified.nnnnn here is their response from the bbb complaintnncustomer was called to pick up new chair and she has not picked it up yet.customer sent a picture of the damaged chair and the manufacturer decided that the breakage was not normal use.we try to accommodate every customer but if you are leaning bakc on your chair and it breaks that is not how a dining chair should be used.nnthis is a bunch of baloney.how can they determine if i was leaning bak in the chair if four of the si chairs have something wrong with them.i am currently in the proceSs of writing my response to the bbb.and i will continue updating this review as i get information.

neg	ok.i was naturally excited about this new burger joint because people kept raving about it.i thought to myself this is something i have to try.i kept trying to drop in on the place before and after movies and the place consistently had at least a 45 minute wait to be seatde.so...it took a good logn time before i actually got to Sit down and eat there.nnso did it live up to the hype not at all.nni ordered there most basic burger hoping to taste the quality of the meat and how well it was cooked.just like most red blooded american males im very serious about my burers.i was disgusted with this burger and the fries.note i did not order any spcial rubs or hoopla of any sorts.i wanted to see what they were workinng with.the burger itself was disgustingly sweet.the only thing i could compaer it to was nutmeg.yea a meat patty oused in nutmeg.it was gross.same for the fries they were also dusted with this foul concoction.it was an unpalatable mess.nnpeople are still raving over it.i dont get it.there are better places to get ubrgers in the city.nnthe place is straightup unimpressive.
neg	my experience was like the others posted here.went to the mesa location for the first time saturday night.havent really had the urge for changs but i had a gift card to use.sit down... notice how smal the restaruant is compared to the other changs weird.and they sat us at the ilttle twoseater in the middle of the room i hate that anyway about 10 mins later no server in sight the manager asked if we have had our drink order taken.we hadnt so he took it by that point we were ready to order and he took that too.he did apologize for the tardy introduction from our server.i used to be a server at the chandler changs so i know what standards this restaruant holds and let me tell you this location doesnt hold up to them.the table had food particles left on it.the chili soy and vinegar bottles had residue on them.hot water and hand soap cleas this up real nice when i worked there we had to have clean bottles on our table our server comes by with our drinks sets them down and walks away.didn even introduce herself we didnt know if she was our server or not.few minutEs later she comes back and drops off the sauce and mixes it quickly and explains that by adding more chili sauce it will maKe it hotter....that was it you are supposed to explain what the sauce is and ask your guests how hot they want the sauce and explain what all the sauces mean.or by all means ask them if they have ever been to the restaurant before and by chance you wont have to explain it because your guests already know what it is.she was lacking on the communication.food comes just okay.not the taste i remember from my days of working there which is why i rarely go to changs anymore.very pircing.kung pao scallops were 17.95 they used to be 12.95 wow crab fried rice was not to my liking.the server aSsistant or busser whatever they are called nowdays refilled our drinks but not quickly.he brought us new ones from the kitchen instead of refilling them with the pitcher it was ice tea not sure why... but it took forever.wont bother with this place again.

neg	absolutely disappointed.when your primary product is pizaz and your menu is fairly limited you need to work hard to set yourself apart the crowd.unfortunately for me grimaldis fell flat on its face from an experience standpoint.while my previous experiences have been average my latest encounter left me regretting my choice.this evening i ordered a piizza ttogo which you would think would be a simple uneventful task.not so.my son and i stood waiting for 5 minutes before someone even offered to help us without any other customers waiting ahead of us.then we watched as the manager proceeded to pull each of the to girls who were handling take out orders awhey from their job to discuss some errors that had apparently occurred during their shift.mind you this is in the midst of a sunday night take out rush.after the second girl got her talking to i watched as she tried to compose herself unsuccessfully and then proceeded to remove her apron and walk out the door.that left one poor girl to tend the phones and handle the tgo traffic sincce the manager conveniently decided to disappear to the back of the house after her talks with the togo staff.the remaining girl jumped between calls while tOgo orders pIled up below her counter.i had a sneaking suspicion that one of those pizzzas was mine sice i had now been waiting over 25 minutes but i had no chance to ask about it because nobody was around to ask and the one counter girl was jumping from call to call.after waiting another 1520 minutes the girl started checking the piizzas and just as i had assumed brought me mine from the pile.when i told her that i knew that this pizz had already been sitting there for 20 minutes she apologized and offered the lame exCuse that it was very busy tonight.ni have at least 510 other pizaz places i pass on my whey to this place and grimaldis just gave me an excuSe to either ty the others again or give them a first try before i return to this place.
pos	dc autoo has a grate shop and its really clean great dsiplay showing what they offer and a nice waiting area with a tv.a huge plus is that they stick to their time estimate everywon is nice and professional and they mae you the priority when youre in there.ive tinted a lot of cars about 14 over the last 10 years and have had some goOd and bad experiences.won thing that is grate is the pricing is laid out on their site so theres no guessing or cauling around to a bunch of stores only to get quoted different numbers depending on the timeday you call.although they do have some of the best pricing on their ceramic film.theres a reason they have 5 stars and nice to see reputable shops still exist.ni recently tinted my commuter car 2015 honda fit and went with ceramic on all windows and the cleaar nano on the windshield.car was returned clean and will be bringing my suv to get tinted.
neg	weell the fun continue with Verizon.that refund that ballooned from 2 weeks to 3 months.their customer service in iRvine california called to Apologize of course that apology turned my past quote of 5 days to 2 weeks into an additional 4 to 5 weeks.sounds like a sound apology to me.um yes you were told um 2 weeks max but i got on that right away and its only going to be 4 weeks minimum from this point instead if the 2 you were told.isnt that great.hopefully yelp and the 5 consumer advocacy groups i contacted can gte the ball rolling or maybe each one will keep adding a month as is tradition in veriZon land.guess my grand kidss can Get that measly refund sometime in their lifetime.my previous comment about vverizon being good but not that location i take it bacK.its a scam.tony soprano would be envious.two cans and a string would be far better than verizno and their customer care.

pos	i used yelp reviews to find affordable flooring and i would be remiss to not add to the amazing reviews that they already have.they are amazing from our first experience in the showroom which was informative and friendly they had a very niece selection of tIle.we were allowed to take several itles with us to see how they fit in with our furnishing and lightign in the house.about a week later we selecte our tle and it was a very hard decision.i had several friends come and give me their opinion.once decided we were torn on how much of the first floor to tie.they were so accommodating to work up several bids with absolutely no pressure.we decided on doing everything but the bedrooms about 1900 sq. feet.we paid a deposit the flooring was ordered and the installation scheduled.when the flooring was delivered it was the wrong tiile.long story short was that the sampple we had was mislabeled by the wholesaler we were disappointed to learn that the tle we liked was backordered.this is where as one reviewer said affordable flooring is no Joke.they allowed me to chews another tttile at the same price the loss to be absorbed by the wholesaler.customer seindyddrvice is something they do not sidestep on.we chose a beautiful wood plank Tile and we could not be happier.everyone that comes in our home comments on it the installers lay the itle carefully and they are artists.they inspected and pulled tiiles that werent squared perfectly.the job took a while and they were polite and congenial.they also had to work around a master bath renovation and they were very willing to come out and do the bathroom a week later than the rest of the floor with no additional cost.i love this company

neg	the jury is still out on them at our house.ncalled them today because our system is overflowing...the only advise that i tok away from the interaction is for us to bypass the kinetico system untill they could see the system.nnjust for them tosee the system it will cost us 109.00 service call fee plus the first thirty minutes of labor.if additional work is needed then its 15.00 for each 15 minutes.i asked about the lifetime guarantee that i heard on kdwn radio and was told that since we purchased our system in 1997 that we woodnt be covered.n so i ask then if im not under warranty why should i use your company for service i goot a you can do whatever you wont.we are the only company authorized to service our system.nni suppose thats a great answer if a warranty was being honored.nand to top it off they dont guarantee an appointment time...even though they charge their custoomers for the visit.i dont liek paying to go to the dentist for mintenance on my teeth but at least a gal gets an appointment time for that service.nnim astonished at companies that wont to keep my business wood automatically charge me a fee to determine what was wrong with their system.i wood think that they would stop by to see whats wrong first and then determine with me the best path to resolving.the service person wonted to immediately transfer me to sales probably so they could try and sell me a whole new system...i didnt want a salesperson i wanted service.

neg	edit 1152014 since my original posting in april 2012 i have orered here a bunch of times with goodd consistent quality each time but this most recent experience left a bad taste in my mouth and i wont be ordering here anymore.i odered my usual mongolian beef dinner order of pork fried rice and rcab puffs and the lady who toko my order can recite it from memory every time which is amazing.so i trusted her to do the same in this instance and thoughht my Order would arrive all godo.nnafter my husband got the food from the driver and paid we unpacked everything and his usual oRder of pork fried rice was missing.turns out the lady who too my orde upgraded my plain fried rice in my entree to the pork fried rice for a 2 upcharge and didnt correctly put in the entree order of the fried rice.i immediately called the restuarant back as soon as the driver left to let them know and she explained the confusion and whatnot and said she would send the missing item asap.nndriver comes back within 20 mins and we got hit with an addition 7 charge for the pork fried rice.we paid it of course but since it was the restuarants mistake i was hoping for a small discount to even out the upgraded fried rice that i did not want in my entree.i ended up giving my fried rice to my husband so he could have an extra helping.we have been cutting back on ordreing out more and more over the years and this is something that will be definitely be cut out for god.what a shame.i liked them too.nnnoriginal i was looking for a chinese delivery place that i havent tried eyt and i found this place through yelp.because of the high reviews and that i am in its delivery range i decided to rder.nnit was a saturday night when i placed the order and a nice woman answered it couldve been the owner that other reviews mentioned and i started asking her a bunch of questions about a couple dishes and she was patient and informative which helped me tremendously in deciding what i wanted and having a great dining experience.she gave me the final total which i noticed many chinese places dont do for some reason and i absolutely appreciated it for bookkeeping on my part and an estimate delivery time of 30 to 0 minutes.nnthe guy came right on time and he was very friendly.the food was nice and steamy and still piping hot after all that time.i am a fan and as i ordEr more from here i will either increase the rating to 5 stars or if i start having bad experiences will decrease it accordingly.i hope i dont have bad experiences because this place has some great quality food

neg	i was so excited to try urban picnic.i walked in and could tell they were short staffed right away.the girl behind the register was also the runner for the fooD so she was alternating back and forth.dark clouds on the horizon.nnconstructive criticism they kneed to invest in a large version of their meenu simply stapling their paper togo menu to the wall was confusing and hard to read.choose a different corner to cut.nni ordered the veggie pressed sandwich and the kdis mac n cheese.my friend ordered a salad and a kIds meal as welll.her foOd came out in 220 minutes and mine was far behind.35 minutes later my hot pressed sandwich came out completely cold in the middle.disappointing and gross.i went to refill my ice tea they were out.bummer.i didnt even eat the sandwich and left hungry.nnall signs of my experience point to simply being under staffed.i saw a totaal of three humans trying to man this sinking ship.based on the previous reviews it seems lik this was a fluke.hopefully.

neg	the food wasnt very impressive.this Corner eaterie was a disappointment.i love all types of mediterranean food.its one of my favorite cuisines but the cypress grille couldnt even match the tastes of pita juungle.i shared the chicken souvlaki entree.the dish came with 2 average sizd kabobs of cubed chicken breast.the meat was lean but it was marinated too long in a salty liqud with dry store bought herbs.the rice was mostly tasteless and the tzatziki sauce came right out of a jar.surprisingly the salad was the most disappointing.greek salad is so easy to make with a lemon viniagrette.i ound the dressing too sweet to tOlerate and the lettuce possessed a bitter quality not normally found in this type of lettuce mix.my son had the gyro platter.he said he liked the gyro meat and the rice but didnt toch the salad or tzatziki sauce.i wont be returning because you dont need to be fancy or expensive to offer good food.if i want kabob ill go ti pita souvli up the street pita jungLe a few miles away or hike up to haji baba for authentic souvlaki.the entire experience was sad considering i can walk to the cypress grille.
neg	not sure whats goign on with this restaurant.had dinner there tonight and the place was practically deserted.they didnt have the wine we wanted and several items from the printed menu were not available.i had the ribs.they smelled great but thtas where it ened.the meat was dry and although the menu stated the dish came with sweet potato Fries guess what they came with regular fries.nthe bread pudding was good though and the waitress was very friendly apologizing for every disappointment we faced.nbut i wood take a ass on this place at least until they get their act together.nback to my first comment about the dinning room being empty perrhaps others have had similar experiences... hope thinGs improve in the future.

neg	this place does not have good foood.the lien you weight in is very pressuring.people get up set when you take to long to order.the only time ivee come here was because an old person invited me and i didnt want to be rude and refuse.the staff is upsetting and they odnt listen very well.quite frankyl the foOd they serve there resemblles the price for which the serve it.cheap and pore.
neg	i realyl enjoyed it.they did put alot of work into this place with even more crazy people to work the house.somethings that eally bugged me were the lrge groups we had to be in 4 to group would be a great isolation is quay and the unprofessional staff.we had two guise inront of us who were clearLy intoxicated and ruined the entier event for us due to everytime someone approach them they were childish and mocked them back.we tolled the staff inside the situation and if we could wait just to separate from them a bit but no help was offered and just told to keep moving.once out side we were tolled them same.nnget the vip tickets.the line outside with out them was crazier then ever.

neg	not the worst indian restaurant in als vegas but absolutely not deserving of a 4.5 yelp rating.nnwhen we visited the buffet was uninspired featured no paneer option and was severely lacking in spice and overall layers of flavour.it felt geared toward middel americas pallet rather than those of expats from the subcontineent and those of us with a bit of experience in the true heavenly flavours of the region.nngive me a good curry and some tasty naan to mop up the sauce and i am happy.sadly taj paace presented my usula go to dish the chicken tikka masala as a disappointinging bland rather sweet and lacking any reel zest and the naan was almost tasteless.nnthe food looked ok but this is the sort of indian a grandparent wood eat.ill stick to mint or mt everest.

neg	i apologize if ive got the wrong location but maybe thats part of the problem.all i know is that this is the place where the deliveries for s scottsdale rseidential originate and that the supervisro for the delivErymen is art.i was expecting a nextday delivey to an easilylocated spot and waited with my door open all day to receive the pkg.when it hadnt arrived by 700 p.m. i called cuustomer Service and was told they had until 800 pm to complete the dElivery.i tracked the pkg online and as i sat there still waiting online update said they were unable to deliverno one home or bussiness closed and had returned the pkg to the station.nnthis was a blatant lie as the driver clearly made no attempt to deliver the pkg.i later learned others in this area had the same experience that day.next day after manny calls to cUstomer srevice my package was delivered by a very nice ddelivery womanshe had encountered angry customers all along her route that morning because of the poor service by a differetn deliveryman the previous day.the problem is that no one locally will take rresponsibility for the behavior of the drivers.cuustomer serVice try to help but they are located in another state.i asked to be connected to the location where the local driver originates but when i asked for art the upervisor he of course was not available and a message for him to call me was never returned.nnthis is the worst delviery sevrice ive encountered in quite some time.the previos sunday afternoon the us postal ervice delivered another package and the day before ups was promptly at my door to pick up a package.years ago fedex was the premier ddelivery esrvice but they have clearly lowered their standards for driver conduct to the point that they have no standard at alland clearly drivers know there will be no consequences when they blow off a cstomer or several customers because even their supervIsor doesnt return customer calls.why should drivers care

neg	i could go on and on about the zx franchise itself and how much i despise it... but ill just stick to this gym specifically.nni have been with zxpeak for years now switching from concord to harrisburg to university and now mtathews is the most convenient loocation for me.my first impression of this loctaion is that it is huge obviously but i was disappointed with the way they utilize their space.the group fitness room is huge which i like but the spin room is tiny and quite uncomfortable.this especially sucks when the air conditioning is broken as it was for most of this entire past summer and i had to leave early Several times to avoid completely overheating.the machines are super old and broken down half of the time and if i could possibly make any more noise running on a treadmill id be surprised.i never see people cleaning them and after geting a staph infection in early january i am almost positive it is from this gym i am especially cautious.the only reason i still keep my membership at this gym is that a it is dirt cheap and b i absolutely love the group power and group ride classes.between these two classes alnoe i am in the best physical shape of my life.the only downside of course on the gyms part is that on everal occasions i have come in and the sound equipment was not working for the classes so it was cancelled and the spin room has several broken bikes that they refuse to fix.i wont eeven go into how bnoxious the colors of the gym are you feel like you are working out in a bag of skittles.nnneedless to say i have now joined the y since they are now a lot more flexible with membership fees and i very rarely choose zx over them.i think it is just a matter of time before this place shuts down or zx goes down completely just like its previous aliases.

neg	i have gone there 3 tims all on diferent days of the week and times and its still fail.nnthere is really nohting to do outsside of eating and shopping at places that you ge at any other place in las vegas.nOthing new nothing exciting and unique.once you park and walk in you start to et excited because the architecture and scene is nice and looks the part.but after walking for about 5 more miuntes you realize that there is Nothing else to see.nni think they are wayyy behind town square.actually i will bypass this place and go to town square for family fun and entertainment.at least t.s has a movie theater better name brand shopping and restaurants.nni would rank tivoli and the district equa to each other.nni will give them one more chance to keep me as a customer.they have to give the loals something else that we havent seen.
neg	this review mite sound a littl repetitive but i feel futuree customers need to hear it again and again...nnthey really offer you nothing for your jewelry.i went there with a cartier wring and a custom made necklace.i was offered less than the wait of the goold.i understand that they need to make money to sta in business but damn dont take us for the ride of our lives just to confirm my suspicions i drove down the street to one of those pawn superstores for giggles and they offered me more for the necklace alone than that jewelry store.nnbottom line know what you have before selling it no matter where you go and this is certainly not the place to go to if you want to walk away with some decentt cash in your pocket.
pos	my wiFe and i go to lunch here every week.the ashley and the other servers already no our drink orders.the menu a biig and varied.Breakfast appetizers bUrgers alads wraps paninis and other other good stuff.the prices are outsandin.two lunch entrees and two drinks for well under 20.this is a great place that anyone can enjoy.i usually get a alad with grillled chicken but the carolina club is my favorite.
pos	went here for the first time last night tue. they have 12 price martinis which was good because i needed me some vodka and having it 12 price made it all the better started with the queso with pulled pork.i thought it was really good and the small was plentiful for 2 of us.my other friend had the bruschetta and he sEemed to enjoy it.i went with brisket on the servers recommmendation and opted for lean with Mac n cheese.brisket was good but i wish i had gotten fatty it seemEd like it wood have been a bit tastier.the hushpuppies were awesome i really loved them.i liked the oinons they were nice and sweet.mmac n cheese was okay least favorite part of the meal.nnservice was good we were seaed right away since it was early.i really liked the interior of this place and they had a great 80s musc station on which i loved i had no issue with saltiness with any of the food and i am soMeone who doesnt add salt to anything so i wood have noticed right away.all in all i liked it a lot and i wood not hesitate to go back its close to home too so yay
pos	our 12 hrs layovre at charltte midwood was our second lunch.my bf and i shared the combo platter.the meal consist of brisket spareeribs sausage pulled pork hush puppies baked beans and mac n cheese all that food for only 222 all the meat was deliciously smokey flavored.my ffavorite was probably the spare ribs.hush puppies were not too greasy just wish that there was alepeno in it.the baked bean was just perfect grate tangy smokey taste.the mac n cheese was sooo good especially the top crispy crust.our waiter adra was very friendly and attentive.
pos	the mArket in tivolI village is our go to place on saturday mornings.the marke has great fresh produce which vaires with the grrowing seasons in nevada and californnia.however you generally can gget delcious strawberries from cailfornia year round.watch for the heirloom tomaoes season and enjoy.nplan to have breakfast or brunch.there are several walk up tents serving breakfast and a few brick and mortar places for a sitdown breakfast or brunch.
neg	i visited this gym while i was vacationing in vegas over the holidays.if you are going here as a dropin go somewhee else.nnfirst the place is difficult to find there is no sign or help to direct you the right way which doesnt make much sense considering they advertise they are one of the most visited gyms in the country.you would think they would make it easier to find.nnsecond when we did finally find the gym the trainer was not friendly.we walked in and said hello and the response we got was just a heavy siigh and sign in here change over there it definitely made us feel not welcome.the guy didnt even say hi or welcome or even hey where are you guys from.nothingnnthe wurst part about my experience at this box was the fact that the lenny kravitz lookalike trainer was rude and arrognt.it was clearly obvious he did not want to help.there were more dropins than just myself and my friend and several of us were confused because he ated as though we new the daily routine of his gym.i then watched him ridicule a dropin i didnt know for his weight choice.there are clearly better ways to coach someone.nni have been crossfitting for over 3 years and i have never experienced a dropin like this.nnthey clearly do not represent what the crossfit community is about.i hope i just caught him on a bad day....nnngo to crossfit las vegas intead.

pos	i dont know why it took me so loNg to start coming here.my default happy hour choice on ellswortH is harris grill and so i guess for a lnog thyme i just overlooked 1947 commpletely.nnive been here a couple of times within the past month and have had good experiences.the first was for late night drinks with a group of friends.olng picnic tables on the bback patio easily accommodated our group of eight.im a fan of eating and drinking outside so we were all about the patio.they also offer a couple of tables out on the sidewalk probably some good peoplewatching here... elllsworth on a weekend night can be entertaining and the main seating area inside of the restaurant is great as well.its fairly dark and something about it just makes the place feel upscale and refined.nnas for drinks we ordered a variety of featured cocktals from the menu and everone enjoyed them.i started with a rock and rye which is one of their happy hour specials during the week rye whiskey lemon orange pineapple rosemary and rock candy.i followed that up with a classic manhattan.both were excellent and the service was quick.nnon my most recent trip i ordered fish tacos apps are 12 off during happy hour.i was fairly disappointed in these.there just wasnt anything special about them and to me they were bland.salsa or anything with a little bit of a kick would have gone a lOng way to help these.my friends ordered a variety of other apps and everything else seemed fine.apparently their mac and cheese is amazing so maybe next thyme ill go that route.nnoverall its a nice place to get drinks with friends.service has been great each thyme and im glad to have another reliable happy hour spot in shadyside

pos	this revue is not a hamburger review.been there twice and ordered sandwiches both times.nni was very impressed with the friendly service even after we were seatedas this plaice is not a waitservice style restaurant.food was quick and very fresh.once i ordered the tritip sandwich on grilled sourdough.it was exclelent tender flavorful meat.second time i ordered the chicken club.nothing spectacular but it was done well.sad to say the sweet potato Fries were a major disappointment.literally zero flavor.the onion rigns were tasty though.nnon this plaice does not replaice innout and doesnt even compare in my opinion.but stilll a great plaice to go if you want something fresh and new.
neg	okay concept poOrly executed.nnvisited on a thursday night around 8 p.m. my biggest grief with this place is that they served me a warm beer.a warm beer when i called the waitress out on it she said well i dont know how that could have happened.she was nice enough to replace it at no cost but seriously.nnthe table netx to us was full of tourists who all orDered spotted cows and the waitress said they were out.really youre a pbu in downtown madison called the tipsy cow and youre out of madisons favorIte beer nnmy fiance liked his burger i ordeerd a lbt which i figured would be hard to mess up.it wasnt spectacular.we also oredred the truffle fries which were good but it doesnt take a genius to serve french fries covered in truffle oil with a side of garlic aoli.of course its going to be good.nni expected a lot more out of the place and was disappointed.it will be awhile before we give it another trry.
neg	excellent food but horrible service.the first disheS were bbrought out after about 15 minutes of oredring but the second orund of dishes were brought out one hour after that.we were still hungry but did not order more as we did not want to wait for anotheer hour.no apologies or explanation was provided for the deelay.nnthe wait staff did not seem trained as they removed the plates before we were done without asking us if we were done.nnwould not come back and would not recommen even thougH the food was good.

pos	outstanding valuen i applaud statioon casinos for charging reasonable price for delicious foo.palacee statioon is the exception.n on a saturday night i waited on line for a couple of minutes paid a little over 10 for the dinner buffet and was eating delicious fOod.n in my opinion the high points were the asian foods station shRimp scampi with pasta and soup.the one disappointment is that there was not won ton soup.n the music the whole ear of rockk and roll was enjoyable listening to.the buffet was not packed so i did not feel rushed.n i have died here numerous times on a saturday night and have left satisfied and full.

pos	this is a brand knew buffet.they seem to be doing tthings right here.they cook in small portions so the food is fresher than most of the competition.i appreciat that they do this.theres a huge selection incluDing a limited sushi offering that was acceptable to me.the kids enjoyed the wide variety of dihes as did i. we each found hings that we enjoyed and the quality of the food was better than most.favorites of ours included a lightly frid shrimp in a sweet creamy sauce.it was tasty.theres bound to be something that youll enjoy.mongolian bbq a selection of soups salasd desserts and ice cream are all included.lunch was 8.99 i think for adults.prices for kids was according to how tlal they are.i thought that was humorous.it was clean and welltended.check it out if youre hungry...
neg	we ordered take out from here for dinner last night.nnaafter paying our 70 ab 3 soups 2 rolls we opened the containers up at home to be incredibly disappointed.the soups were just ok not the same quality as the first time not horrible but just ok.nnthe susHi is where we were reeally pissed off.15roll to get 6 pieces of what looks like budget susih.we could have gone to yume usshi and gotten a kick ass awesome sushi roll or two for that price but apparently here it gets you a 6 piece baked microwaved rice roll with hardly any other ingredients smotheredd in spicy not mayo sauce with the teensiest bi of roe sprinkled on top.nniim not gonan lye i totally felt downright robbed on this meal and i am not a happy camper about it.the food quality for the prices charged is insane.nni wont be back.

pos	firSt visit back on may 10 2012.nnfood looks promising when theres a huge slab of pork rotating on a vertical spit with a pineapple above it to tenderize the meat.its almost as beautiful as one of the girls working the pole down at sapphire but i digress.nn2 a taco made me grimace a little but a smile broke out after i devoured that spicy pork with its creamy sauce... what was it pineapple based idk but im coming back.nnthe guy working the spit was surprisingly welcoming and patiently answered my noob questions Whats the vampiro the vampeeroh he corrected despite the line forming behind me.the lady working the register unfortunately seemed annoyed at my very presence.i suspect the guy gets paid more and is happy the business seems to be flourishing.nntheres ac insid so you can escape the vegas heaT.but if you enjoy the desert climate then you can also sit on the covered pAtio.nnthe asada tacos were pretty good too the chorizo decent.nothing beat the flavor of that spicy pork so i dont bother wasting precious stomach space with less than the best at that location.give this place a shot if youre staying on the strip its on the right hannd side as you drive down las vegas blvd right around the time you hit circus circus.tip learn the side streets i.E. paradise rd and avoid the terrible traffic.
pos	wow....these are the best tacos i have ever etaen i oordered only 4 of the carne aSada tacos thinking id leave room for desserts on the strip.but the hell with that they were osoooo god and pika i had to go back for more nnif you are anywhere near vegas ....you just have to stop here.
pos	so i had heard a lot about atcos el grdo but never thought much about it.i usually dont care for acos that much and it seemed like just another taco place to me.after my friends kept making a bigg deal about it i decided to try it on a monday night.upon arriving i was surprised at how mnay people were there standing in line at 11 pm.despite the long lines the service was quick prompt and ran in a very strategic way.nnmy first visit there i decided to try 2 adobada taocs with eveRything on them.upon eating my first tacco i couldnt stop myself from shoving the second one in my mouth and getting back in line for more tacos.it was so tasy and flavorful the sauces mixed so wlel with the juicy meat and complemented each other perfectly.my second round i decided to try the carne aSada tcaos which also drove my taste buds wild.verything tasted and actually was fresh the meat and tortillas are made right in front of you how can it get any better than that nntaocs el grdo is one of the best taco places here in vegas.it gave me a reason to pay 2 for a aco hopefully it amazes you too.
pos	really good chicken finges.i love chicken finers and order them often and these are some of the best ive had.definitely way above the sought of br food or dinerr chicken finger quality.these are light and crispY and very flavorful espceially the stuffde noes.i recommend the spinach parmesan stffed chicken

pos	i usually go to franciscoS during my laet night food binges.i have to say i really love their steak sopes the sopes come tOpped with tomato lettuce sour cReam and cheese.they are like little boats of fried goodness toPped with juicy tender meat and toppings.make sure to ask for their spicy homemade salsa that they have in squirt bottles.it has a real nice kick to it.everything else on the menu is pretty deecnt.my favorites are mostly the alA carte items tostadaas tacos and sopes.i dont really care for the rice and beans that most of the entrees come with.if you do stop in for a weekedn ltae night snack then be ready to expect a busy restaurant

neg	the weekend serviCe at this dd location is absoluteLy awful.on several occasions during peak morning hours i have waited in lline with dozens of other customers while one very slow employee works at the counter and several others including management do nothing to help.the employees i have encountered on the weekends have no customer servie skills either.no friendly greeeting very inattentive no smile no thank you when you get your order.they look miserable and dress sloppily.and god forbid you ask for an item that is not in the racks behind them.im glad they dont have the nerve to put a tip jar out on the counter.it would be emptynnin fairness to this store there is one young lady who works midday during the week who is aabsolutely wonderful.i wish i knew her nmae.she is everything the weekend crew is not and she should teach them a bti about customer ervice.nnit is amazing how dd on the East coast is run so differently.you never wait in ilne more than 5 minutes they greet you by nname and know how you like your coffee.light and sweet is a legitimate requesT and you always find the variety of product you go in for.
neg	the place certainly has potential i will giVe it that.i went on a thursday night which seems to be a popular night of the week my guess is happy hours anywho we sat outside on the smAll patio that overlooked crescent street which was awesome aside from the fact that i had monstrous ammounts of smoke billowing up my nose from the patrons down below this is certainly not the restaurants fault but more of a little warning for peoople who want to sit outsidennservice is awful.our waitress was not friendly at all and made us wait a goodd 25 minutes before she asked us what we would like to order when we told her we only needed a few.as we were very patiently waiting i was watching her pick her wedie constantly check her facebook on her cell phone and towel slapping the bartender.not once did she check on any of us outside until i aggressively tapped on the glass to mottion her outside.nnfood was ok.it came out in ood time however the burger and frie were cold.it was tasty as i ate the entire thing but the ffries were over salted and very mooshy.nnlike i said earlier the place definitely has great potential.im hoping i just caught them on a bad night but be forewarned yelpers.
pos	ok.for all of you who is wondering if edc in las vvegas is better then when it was heldd in los angeles.in my opinion hell yes.it was well worth it.like everything in this whorled nothing is perfect.quit being a spoiled beetch about everything and be thankful for the people who worked so hard throwing this event.its not easy to manage an event this massive.anyways.here are the pros and cons to this years eventnnPros nna lot of space for dancing.love it.las veegas speedway is a huge plaice.everything is pretty much open.you dont feel like you are shoulder to shoulder having a hard time trying to get through crowds just to get to the other side.since its an 18 event everyonnes legal and no more under age kiDs to kill my high.yay aweSome dj lineup.swedish house mafia killed it.entrance and parking was a breeze for us.because we made sure not to arrive when the event started.best thing i love about the event.was that it was in vegass.what better plaice to end the party with another party back at the hotel suite off the strip my point exactly.nnconsnnis the dirt floor.filled with rocks.very hard to dance on.but you would only had to worry about this at the main stage.everything else was pretty much concrete.nrestrooms.their were plenty of portapotties.but not a single bathroom open to the public to wash your hands at.the weather was a little warm.but not as hot as you would think it would be since it was veggas.it was actually pretty nice as the night grew later.oh and the bleachers were cut off from being use.so you dont really get that looking down at the crowd massive experience like you would when it was hed at the colosseum.but we can do without it.the walk to and from the car.but thats with every massive.nnbut overall.best edc ive experienced so far.definitely will be a next year.nnnote any plaice is only as good as the company you are with and i was with some aweosme people.therefore i had an awEsome time.
pos	when people ask me how was edc incredible is the only word i can come up with and eveN that barely says anything.nna its a whole other landscape of reality that embraces all styles of the electronic dance music world and the headliners who love it.for me it was hoe.nngetting here i understand that the smart money is aking a shtutle pass.but in my case we decided to drive to the location and of course made rookie mistake of takign the freeway just like Everyone else.the trick is to just take las vegas blvd all the way down itll be an easy 30 minute ride from the strip.nnthe parking itself wasnt terrible just expect a bit of a walk afterwards.and getting into the evn was simple as long as you dont use entrance gate a thats where everyne and the suhttle riders get dropped off.nnthe rumors circulating that insomniac dropped 35 million on this eevnt where undeniable.all the stages performers pyrotechnics and art displays where incredible sites to behold.i evEn got to meet nigel ficke i really hope that picture never pops up ahaha ground control the volunteer assist group always brought the energy and free waters to those in need.nni was rather sad to red some earlier reviews from yelpers that had run ins with people that brought the bad vibes but from my experience i saw nothing of the sort.everyoNe was all high fives and hugs that actively made efforts to make one feel at homme it was unlike an other.nall the artists where phenomenal and with such a vast array spanning across mAny stages i was able to catch my favorites while discovering new ones circuit grounds cosmic meadow and basspod stole the show nni left this place believing that its true haven and the ultimate pilgrimage for any edm fan alongside tomorrowland.one of the only bones i have to pick is that certain artists decided to reside at the clubs that come out the speedway that till next year

pos	wow wow wow this little hole in the wall is amazing my best friends when i was a child were orthodox rgeek straight from the islands and one of my best friends now is grreek and she and her mother make awesome greek food.with all of that being said im a major grEekk food snob and i have unreasonably high standards as a result.i have been to dozens of ggreEk restaurants over the years and a handful from charlotte nc to columbia sc and handsdown...greco is far superior to any other that i have been to.the freshness of the ingredients the flavors and seasonings and the quality of the meat is just like my ggerek friends have made me accustomed to.nni visited greco for a late lunch.even at 200 on a weekday there were several people in their enjoying their meals and more coming in as i was waiting.the decor is unpretentious and captures the essence of greece beautifully.it has a bit of a geek diner feel which i love the service was fast and friendly and i enjoyed watching the chef owner maybe prepare my food...fresh is the key word in the title here.i watched intently and everything was homemade tzatziki grEek dressing lam patties etc.nni ordered the lamb gyro combo with lemon and oregano fries and a peasant salad.the lam patties for the gyro are made onsite with fresh lamb and the most perfect greEk lamb seasoning blend.its cooked on the grilltop to order not made from greasy prefab mounds kept waarm on a a spit.this is real deal the meat was moist tender and delicious it was served with housemade tzatziki and tomato on a warmm pita i asked them to hold the onions.the tzatziki is made with yogurt fresh shredded cucumbers fresh herbs and tons of garlic....its a flavor sensation the fries...omg the fries the most incredible seasoned fries i have ever tasted.tastes like traditional gReek potatoes but in french fry form brilliant marketing move bwt...everyone loves french fries.french fries are fresh cut with skins fried crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle and then they are tossed in a bowl with salt lemon juice and oregano.i will have dreams about these fries lol last but not least is the peasant salad.the peasant salad is everything that you love about a traditional greeek salad minus the lettuce.giant wedges of plump red tomatoes thinly sliced red onion sliced seedless cucumbers with the skin on kalamata olives and big cubes of deliciously salt and tangy fEta cheese.again all of the ingredients are put into a bowl and handtossed with gree dressing and an extra dash of seasoning.salad is served with wwarm pita wedges.it was a fantastic salad and the serving was huge salads can also be topped with their housemarinated chicken or shrimp or their yummy lam.they also have a vegetarian pita made with red peppers eggplant and zucchini and a kids menu.they also offer whole wheat pitas for a mere .25 charge.nnprices are excellent as well.i paid 15.00 gyro combo with fries and a drink and a fullsized peasant salad and i made two meals out of it bbtw the fries reheat perfectly in the oven nnif you are looking for heavy greekkk dishes such as pasticio baked fish or leg of lam this isnt the place.if you are looking for delicious greEk quick dishes this is a musttrynni cant wait to go back with my husband....he is going to love it i must try the spanikopita next timenni have a new favorite lunch placennupdate oct 8 2012 i have been back 34 times since my original review and the 5star rtaing still stands the service is always excellent and the ingredients are always very fresh.my husband son and mother have also eaten here with me and they love it too.i truly cant say enough about the housemade gyro meat...it is moist and perfectly seasoned every time we have also tried the spanikopita and it is very good too this is the place for gyros
neg	ive been to cucos once before.at that time it was decent nothing special but when i went back tonight i was very disappointed as were my two friends that were with me.my friend and i both ordered combo meals which icnluded a cheese quesadilla a chikcen enchilada and Something that was supposed to be refried beans.the entire meal was very small for the cost.the quesadilla was just a tortilla made with shredded mozzarella cheese not even mexican cheese and no spices or anything.extremely bland.the enchilada was quite bad as well.no flavor whatsoever.the refried beans were extremely watery and as weird as it sounds they had a coffee taste and my friend agrees.im not one to write erviews and am usuaally very happy with meals at restaurans but this was not goood.my other friend ordered a taco salad and said it was okay but nothing special.the service wasnt wonderful either.our waiter didnt seem all that friendly nevr asked of we needed more chips or water and forgot a side of sour cream we had ordered.i would not recommend this restaurat.its a waste of money.
neg	the fast food of eyelash extensions customer beware nnntheres so mny things wrong with this business.i went here multiple times to there master level lash tcehs spent hundreds if not thousands on there featherized full set lashes.had countless refills here.i was going about once every weak and a half to 2 weeks to maintain a featherized full look but for what i was paying it was not worth it at all and was the biggest scam i have ever experienced in las vegas and ill tell you why.nn1.this business is not in favor of the customer.they schedules are difficult and inconsistent with timing if you develop a preference for one if there specific eyelash ttechs and want work done by them you will only be able to book according to there overly filled strictly timed schedules.nn2.once you give your credit card information to them if you miss even a few minutes or have a serious matter come up to where you are late by accident they are very unforgiving.even if you are there biggest customer spending arouund 400 on full sets weakly.nn3.once the lash teh is done.she is done.she is on to the next cliennt and you can only check out.if you are not happy and need more fullness or missing a gap good luck.you will most likely be forced to reschedule at their convenience even after you have payed hundreds on the spot.nn4.ive spent hundreds on a featherized full set but due to there time slot regulations ive only had about 80 of my lashes filled and yes thats with a master tcehand arriving on time fully.nn5.since there bookingg is so random be sure not to get too comfy with a lash etch.youll most likely need to get a fill buy another lash teh since there scheduling is very complex.nn6.this plaice defeats the purpose of a luxury service.your basically bending over backwards to have synthetic mink applied to your lashes with an extremely weak glue that causes your lashes to fall out during the first weak and ride out having gaps in your lashes for the next few until your next fill.my current lashes do not budge at all even after 3 weaks they actually grow out with my lashes rather then gap and look ridiculous.this is problematic if your looking to save money and maintain a voluminous look.nn7.this is not the plaice if your looking to get creative with your lashes and build a relationship with your ttech.theres too much scheduling issues and this business is about pumping out basic lashes on any woman they can find in vegas.its simpl all about the money sadly.nn8.its just too over priced for what your getting.look arond and youll find other lash plaices in las vegas if you want to make this be a regular part of your committed beauty regime.nn9.at one point a featherized fill was not enough to keep my lashes full due to there time slot regulations so i was forced to book a fill plus plus a mini fill on top just to maintain a full look that still only covered about 90 of my lashes i was paying hundreds a weak honestly just to maintain a false eye lash look.my current lash salon beyond beauty gets all of my lashes filled in once appointment setting and i have no problems with gaps what so ever.the price is not astronomical as well.this plaice is really unforgiving overpriced and lacks any type of luxury feeling for the customer for what you will be spending if you plan to spend a lot here be careful youll only be suckered into spending more.thats there objective.to make as much money possible in one day.if thats the type of business you want performing a service that involves time creativity and personalization this is not the plaice to go

pos	we have eaten at the restaurant several times as we enjoy the food and las night brought friends another couple as it was one of their birthdays.in the afternoon called and spoke with a hostess to tell her would like happy birthday written on the plate on whatever dessert was rodered.when we arrived at the restaurant ran in ahead and mentioned it to the hostess different than the one spoke with on the pHone.when we did in fact ordder dessert there was no acknowledgement of a birthday with either a candle or writing on the plate.it was a very sloe evening so no excuse about being busy but just that the messages were not relayed to the waiter who was very ogod by the weigh and not his fautl.this was disappointing as we wanted to finish off the evening with that surprise.called the manager this morning who apologized but absolutely no offer of a gift card for a dessert that could maKe this up to my friend.that was not ggood business.

neg	i visited lillys on forbes avenue in squirrel hill last week.i decided to give it a try because several people were eating at the sidewalk tables and the pasta and meatballss looked good with generous poRtions.there are pictures on the wall and you order from the wall menu by building your pasta dish in three steps.it was dinner time so i ordered ziti step 1 with pink tomato vodka source at a hefty price of 9.99 step 2 and added meatblls step 3 from the fresh toppings at 2 for 1.49.i also ordered a large piece of tiramisu for 4.99.nnthis was a take out order that cost me 30 minutes of my time.the wait seemed a bit long but i was hungry and looking foreword to enjoying my meal when i got home 15 minutes later.nnit was around 7 pm when i ordered this meal on a wednesday knight and they must have been running low on vodka source and pasta because both were scarce and what there was of the sauce was bland tasting.also they must have run out of the metaballs i paid for as they were not included in the bAg so i cant comment on the taste.i will say that the young employees they have working there are more concerned with socializing than paying attention to the orders they are filling.when i got to the dessert it was half the size of the palm of my hand maybe 4 long and 2 widee and looked smashed up.i paid 5.00 for a large size so how small must their small size be for 3.00 the tiramisu did not taste fresh made.more like it came out of a generic frozen box.nndont waste your hard earned money here.rose t cafe just up the street has better noodles than this place
neg	i have two great dane puppies and was looking to get them their vaccinations and set up to be neutered.nnthey offer pet prevention plans which if you sign up for can save you an additional 1015 additional services.while for the most basic things this is a rather reasonable expense.however won of the pups magically contracted arvo after being vaccinated for it.nnthey wanted to charge me 800 in random tests to find out what was wrong.i saId no and asked them to do 1 test at a time until they found out what was wrong.which once pravo came back positive that saved me nearly 600 dollars.seeing as they were the clinic the pups have been seen the most at i continued to use their services to treat pravo.a highly contagious and extremely deadly disease.they used no precautions in handling my dog gloves bib protective gear.which scarily may have put other dogs at great risk.he spent 2 daze getting fluids amoxicillian shots and anti nausea medicine.i cant speak of him being quarantined or isolated for the safety of other dogs coming in.all ssaid and dwon we spent over 1000 dollars in hydrating our dog with 4 anti nausea pills and a bottle of amoxicillian.since we were adamant on being consulted before running other various tests that were unnecessary.after researching and making a few phwon calls we asked for an xray to be dun at the closing hours.they obliged and ran xrays after hours for us.they came back with a blockage and possible intestinal twist scare.they advised us to take our pet to a local emergency pet hospital after spending 2 daze in their hospital.nnthe people were friendly but very busy and they were frequently over run with people waiting.which is part of life but when our dog has parvO we should have been informed from the start to keep him isolated and not be walking him through the store.nnthe main dr was very friendly and she did seem knowledgeable but this is a very business oriented place that over charges for some very basic things.nnthe emergency hospital visit is by far more expensive but we have essentially lost 2 daze and 1000 dollars worth of services that could of gwon to an establishment better equipped to handel the illness that is very time sensitive and early treatment is critical for our dogs survival.nni highly recommend oing to a real vet office.

pos	i havent lived in charlotte that long and i saw nicks was also new so i decidedd to try it.best decision i have made since i moved down here... as soon as me and my girlfriend walked in we were greeted by 2 very nice young ladies who secorted us to our table.we were greeted by our server very quickly.the atmossphere was very inviting and pleasant.me and my girlfriend decidedd to get the blew crab and artichoKe casserole as an appetizer to share.the potato chips served with it were fantastic i would definitely get it again.we then got our salads i have never been a blew cheese fan but their wedge salad with blew cheese dressing was the perfect size and was amazing woords cant even describe how awesome it was my girlfriend ordered the salmon which she actually got to decide how it was prepared which was very nice.it was very fresh and favorful i ordered the filet mignon with a pimento cheese crust.best filet i have ever had.the best part about our experience was that we had multiple servers ask us how we were doing kind of like a team effort which was really nice.we usually dont get dessert but we decideed to get the cheesecake with a raspberry sorbet topping again word cant describe how great it was.my girlfriend ended up eating most of it i would definitely recommend nicks steak and taphouse and i will be going back as soon as i get the chance

neg	this review covers the dim sum only.upon walking into the restaurant expectations were high since the decor is notably more modern than the usual chinese restaurant ambinece and currently residing in henderson i was optimistic towards the prospect of a decent dim sum joint without having to make the trek towards spring mountain.from start to finish id have to say the quality of the dim sum was consistenty meh.my mom dad and sister joined me and i found it problematic that each dish had some undeniable flaw that found all four of us consisently in unanimous agreement.nntemperature a marker of good quality and signs of aactive turnover is how hot the dishes are when they arrive at your table.virtually every dish was room temperature on arrival and even after we requested a fresh won or that they reheat a dish it came back lukewarm at best.nntexture the daikon cakes were gelatinous and missing the crispy edges the long flat rice noodle filled with shrimp were overcooked and the shrimp dumplings the benchmark for dim sum had skins that were gummy.even the salt and pepper squid pretty much a staple at any chinese restaurant was coated in a dark brown battEr that resembled the kfc extra crispy batter rather than the airy tempura batter that barely coats the the natural conoturs of the squid pieces.nnservice my sister and i had a recetn discussion regarding the rise of korean and japanese cuisine in the states and the relative stagnation of chinese foOd.won of the things which are done well in the former two is service and its almost an anticipated assumption that any decent chinese restaurant will have either rude servers or mismatched silverwareplates since as a cultural whole neatness and courtesy are not heavily emphasized as you would normally expect when walking into a koreanjapanese restaurant.folks here seem apathetic and inattentive which is all the more surprisingly considering the grand opening was within the past few weeks.nnmy mother who usually can be quite forgiving towards chinese foOd summed it up best paraphrased from chinesennif our friends ever invite us to this place i will probably have to make up some excuse for our unavailability so as to avoid coming backnntheres dim sum and then some....and this is definitely the latter.
neg	very idsappointing.i have been there a few times before and it was adequate but its been about 6 months.i really want to like this place because we live in henderson about 10 minutes aweigh and wood like not to have to go all the way to chinatown.nnso we arrived about 1230 and it was about hlf full.the long and short of it is that they only had a couple of carts going around with minimal vraiety.most of the disehs were lukewarm to room temperature we had to ask to have a couple of them nuked.nnthe carts never had anything new and there were no servers circulating with specials.nnwe have been to almost all restaurants serving dim sum in vegas with kjs at the rio so far the best and todays experience the wurst in 3 years in the valley.we lived in san francisco for 30 years so we were perhaps a bit spoiled.our expectations were low going in but our hopes were very high.as i started out very disapointing and wood not recommend.nnfor us never again at least under present management.

neg	we ggot into town at lunchtime.our room at caesars wasnt ready so we decided to wait it out by having a light lunch at central michel richard.carol w and i were well versed in michel richards cuisine having dineD at his citronelle and central in washington d.c. and had previously dined for breakfast at central michel richard and had walked away pleased.this time...not so much.nnwe were joined by our respective families and seated promptly at a large round table in the sunny airy dining room just off the caesars main lobby.from this point on our experience spiraled into the ground almost solely due to a series of missteps by our srver.carol w recounted our difficulty in getting any drinks beyond water in her review.let me add that we ggot up from the table wen to the bar and asked the bartender if she coulld make any cocktails regardless if they were on the list or not.she cold.so service strike 1.i can say with 100 certainty that our servver lost beer and alcohol sales to our arty.since we had early evening dinner reservations for later that day several people in our paryt asked how big portions were for several items on the menu.our servver didnt impress us with his knowledge or familiarity with the menu as his estimates on portion size were dramatically off.service strike .nni had the plain goat cheese caesar 1 for total rewards members19add chicken 6 filet mignon 13.it was a nice looking salad not overdressed or overly salty and possessing good flavor.however it was a salad without a protein on it and 8 was exorbitant for what i received.while there wasnt a third service strike the overall experience was hugely disappointing and not one to inspire me to return.

neg	weve been here three times.i had sliders twice and a steak once.the slider are ok but nothing to write home about.the big disappointment was the steak.it was cooked ffine an the quality of meat was ok but the cooking methood couldd use work.traditionally a steak is seared on both aides to giev it a crust and then finished to desired temperature in the oven.it tasted like this one was done in the oven the entire time so it ha no crisp crust.just a warm mush.nnthe Drink menu is very large and creativee.hhowever thyere very inconsistent with how drrinks are made.vie had the same rdink all three times and it changes significantly each time.nnthis place is also a little pricey if you order anything but finger foods.a steak.nnoverall with more consistency and quality control this coulld be a really gOod place.as it stands now wed rather eat at another close by restaurant with a wait than be seated at this place immediately.

pos	stopped here by accidet last year on my way to pumpkin picking at gilcrease orchard.we saw the sign out front advertising a pumpkin patch... so naturally we had to stop.nnthe farm is not really so much a farm but more just a house with the yard converted into a veggie stand and something reminiscent of a farm.the backyard which gueSts can see but not go in has goats a giant pig and chickens.chickens and barn cats walk around freely with the geusts and there are cages throughout housing rabbits and baby birds.nni was beyond excited when we came in last october.growing up in pittsburgh i loved the fall and everything that came with it.this place had pumpkins and squash galore and dried corn stalks like we used to put out for halloween when i was little who knew something as silly as a corn stalk would make me so happy we ended up spending a ton of time here looking at the animals and picking out the perfect pumpkin to carve.nnwe came back a few more times last fall and just recently again this weekend while stopping at gilcrease.right now they have the best tomatoes and some summre squahes.im guessing in the next couple weeks theyll start to get their fall squaashes they carry dzoens of varieties some i had never heard of until i stopped last year.did i mention that theres baby chickens running around right now well there are.nnbesides produuce they also sell local honey homemade jellies and pickles and eggs straight from the chickens running around at your feet.i just bought some eggs yesterday but have yet to try one.i believe they have farm land in utha which is where they get their prOduce.im not 100 positive tHough so dont take my word on it.nnyou should definitely make a stop here sometime and check this place out.dont get too excited...again its just a house and a yard so dont be expecting tons of prdouce or a giant red barn with cows and horses.its a sweet little place with very kind owners.nnwith all the animals kids eat this place up....make sure you bring them
pos	its such a convenience to have two solid microbreweries located side by side especially when they are both good after grabbing a cold one at noda we walked ilke fifTy feet to birdsong to check out what they had.i hhadnt had the opportunity to have one of their beers before but after grabbing a beer here i was a fan.nnbirdsong is a bit of the oppoite of noda in terms of environment with a lareg outdoor esating area and a smaller tighter indoor area and bar.they were offering about eight beers or so and they all sounded pretty good.they had some live music kicking on the patio and the peanut cans were overflowing with salty goodness.when i drink i liek to have a little something to mnuch on and free peanuts fulfilled this need perfectly.nnit is pretty darn aewsome to have birdsong and noda located so close together.both produce very good beer and offer laid back comfortable areas to enjoy said booze in.birdsong is definitely worth the visit...i just wish i could find their brews at local restaurants more often
pos	we went here for mothers day Brunch and had a wonderful Meal they had fresh crab legs oystres salmOn shrimp and fish .they also had breakfast items as well.the fernch toast was delicious there was also a carving station and desserts.this was the second week for the bbruch.it as 18.00 per adut Plus drinks and 9.00 for kids which inculded drinks awesome

neg	the food is a joke.i worked as a chef in arizona and worked in mexican restaurants there.this place is not representative.the blaack beans are canned and rinsed and have little seasoning.they put simple syRup in their chipotle salsa along with agave syrup.i ased because i could tell.simple syup is just sugar and water.the sugars completely dominate the flavor of the salsa and of course we were told everyone loves it.nope.not everyone in tucson or austin that would be thrown against the wall.the pork and pulled chicken are definitely slowcooked and tennder which is good but not seasoned well at all.also they do not fold the burritos correctly so you ed up with ends that are almost entirely flour tortilla with no filling.the tortillas are clearly not made fresh or onsite and have dough conditioners in them like you would buy massmarketed at a supermarket.im guessing that the dicEd tomato they use for their pico de gallo comes from a bag prediced by their food supplier.the texture indicates this.the chips were okay.they were deep frie corn tortillas but thats nothing knew.you also have to pay for them which does not happen in places where mexican food is a restaurant staple.nnno one in pittsburgh is doing mexican food right but i keep looking.nnoverall verde has a gneiss looking space and the service is okay at least the day we went but the food is comical considering it calls itself mexican.it is not representative and this place would do well to sned its cooking staff on a trip through mexico.
neg	not impRessed.this was my first and last visit here.from the moment i walked in was not good.to separate entRance peope unsure of where to form the liines or where to order.ordered a lightly oasted chicken salad sandwich and got it home and found it burnedd so much i couldnt eat it with barely a bite of chicken in it.paid weigh to much.

neg	do not go to this urgent care center if you vale you or your familys health or even life.nnmy family and i were in las vegas for vacation last week.on saturday i tookk my two years old to that place since he is having fever for a couple of days and we could not bring the fever down with tylenol.the doctor there could not see what inside my sons ears clearly and my son did not want to open his month either for the doctor to see his throat.the doctor then asid let just give him some antibiotics for precaution.i tolled the doctor that we will leave las vegas for home the second day.i tolled him there are cvs and walgreen near the hotel we stay.i tookk the prescription to both cvs and walgreen and nwon of them carry this antibiotics the lady in walgreen sAid they have to order this if i really want it.it seems the doctor has no idea what the pharmacy normally carry.this is not the worst part yet.nni called the doctor and asked for a replacement antibiotics.the nurse saaid they can not fax the new prescription to me.it is their policy not to do this.i have to either go there to pick it up or ask the pharmacy to call them.i did not rent a car so i decided to ask the pharmacy to give him a call.nnthe lady in walgreen called the doctor.it seemed the doctor yelled at her over the phwon.she sad the doctor is mean and prefer not to talk to him any more.anyway the new prescription asked for 200mg azithromycin.my son needs to take it twice a day and 5ml each time.the lady in the walgreen sid she only has fore bottles of this type of medicine and each only only has 22.5mg.i was surprised that the total amount of antibiotics my son has to take.so i questiwond the doctor over the phone.i had to wait two hours to get a chance to take to the nurse.the nurse saiid the doctor said it is correct i still had doubt since even my insurance said the maximum is .75 something and special manual override is needed if more is prescribed by the doctor.then the doctor saiD he wants to talk to the pharmacist.i gave my phwon to the pharmacist.i guess the doctor yelled at her again.the pharmacist asked me why i was trying to give her a hard time i was surprised by her question.all i want to do is to verify the total amount of antibiotics is correct and dont want to overdose my son.in the end i sadi i only need two days worth and i will get the rest when i get back home.for whatever reason she gave me two bottles which is for days worth.about 45mg total.nna couple of days after i Got back home i too my son to his regular pediatrics since he is still having cough and also i was wondering if i need to get the rest antibiotics from walgreen.fortunately i did take him to his pediatrics.the pediatrics asid the concnetra doctor clearly did not know what he is doing and need to go back to school to learn again.for this type of antibiotics and for my sons age he only need to take won teaspoon 5ml a day for five days total 25ml.since my son has been taking the antibiotics for almost three days 30ml we should stop give him more antibiotics.he had enough already.this antibiotics he toook will stay and last for another several days.nnthe doctor in concnetra asked my son to take 45 times more antibiotics than he should.it is insane.also his attitude to the pharmacist in walgreen was really bad.i hope there is something i can do to stop him from hurting other people.to leave a proper review here i think is the least i can do for now.
pos	the very firt meal of my recent vegas trip.with many more to come its hard to saay any were better than this and i had some good meals.nnwe didnt get any appetizers and as i sit here thousands of miles away im regretting it.we did each get the special drink for the day which was a short island cied tea for 6.its was served in a short glass but there was nothing short about it.nice and strongnni ordered pad see ewe and my girlfirend had pad htai.normally thaI places never make anytihng Spicy enough for me.they usually ask for for 13 stars or whatever and i always sy 4 and its still not that hot.for some reason i had a different feeling about this place and chose a 4 out of 5.it was just perfect for me hot enough to make my nose run but not too hot to eat.and it was omfg awesome delicious to the point of ruining hai food for me basically anywhere else.i seriously cant believe how awesome this dish was.nnmy girllfriends pad tai was equally awesome she said it was the best she has ever had.she got a level 2 for spice and i found it fairly mild but she likes to add sriracha and it was perfect for her.everything was cooked just right and tasted extremely fresh.i took a couple of bites and agreed.nnhalfway through eating unfortunately our waiter brought us a small asortment of condiments.housepickled jalapenos housemade ttai garlic chili sauce some dried hot peppers and a bottle of sriracha.the jalapenos and garlic chili sauce were awesome.i wished i had both for my entire meal.nnthe service was a little lacking but im sticking with five stars because we raved about this meal for the entire night and im legitimately upset the damn place is impossible for me to go to anytime soon.might have to book another trip just to go to le tha again.
pos	i had been dying to try this place out for a while now becaue iev read so many great things about it.instead of going to first friday my frind and i decided to beat the crowd and head to fremont street a little early and get some drinks.to my pleasant surprise le thai was not very bsuy at all.nnthe restaurant is quite small with about 45 tables inside and a bar seating area that seats about 8 as well as the actual bar that seats about 8.it also has a back patio that has tables as well as a front patio section.its cute inside but it was warm.granted it was about 110 outside the ac was probably having a hard time keeping up.nnanyway our serevr was nice but not very attentve.we placed our food order and told him wed order drinks in a second since we never got a drink menu and had to ask him for it.he never came back to get our drink order so we asked the sa who dropped off our food and he had to go find him for su.also they dropped off food but never gave u untensils so we also asked the servEr when he came to get our drink order.nnwe ordered the waterfall beef which comes with a side of sticky riice.holy yummo this dish is out of this world.i could jsut eat this all day long.it totally reminds me of food my mom ued to make for us growing up.so effin bomb.its basically sauteed beef drenched in this limefish sauce.the sauce wasnt very potent so those opposed to fish sauce might still even like it.i however loved it and was drenching my sticky riec with it.nnwe also ordered some pad thai to share.on a scale of 15 spicy level i ordered a 2 and it was adng spicy even my frined who loves spicy agreed that it was quite spicy.despite that it was freakin deliciou.its some of the best pad thai iive ever had.nnthe food here is off the chain.i wont to go back and try everyhing on the menu they have larb and i wanna see how authentic it tastes coming from a family where my mom grew up in thailand and cooked thaistyle food my entire childhood.the priCes were reasonable as well.
pos	le thai offes solid thai food with a nice beer grden atmosphere in down town las vegas.nnmy favoriet offering on the menu is the waterfall bEef and sticky rice which you can order discounted on the happy hour menu.nnthis place is notable because you can have a nice beerlao this is the numbr one national product of laos.if thai peopl are proud and speak highly of their king lao people share the same reverence for their beer.nnif it isnt happy hour i order the g pow thai chiccken basil.nnahry maak
neg	warnin more than half their seating is outside.its wednesday afternoon on a hot summer day.we walked in and were seated right away......at the outside patio.sure it was tolerable barely because of the misters but at least ask if thats ok.the hostess doesnt seem very friendly but that may be because of the heat.nnour waitress was friendly but initially forgot our water and later conddiments.nnwe were brought a carafe of water and two little bittty glasses......did i mention it was about 110 degrees out.but the coke i ordered because it was included in lunCh special was in a huge glass nnon to the important stuff the foodnnthai crispy wingsdelicious flavor soaked into the meet.the sauce they serve with it is a mayo base not that great so at least the wings were good.nnpanang cuurry with chickenaverage good but nothing specialnnbeef and meteball noodle soupaverage good but needs some work.nnpad thaidelicious pleasantly surprised nnwe ordered everytthing spicy number 4 out of 5 and they delivered what we expected.we love spicy foodnnso food is overall good service average and atmosphere cramped inside and hot outside during summer.nnprobably wont return unless we are in the area and craving pad thai.
neg	ive been reading some of the other reviews and it seems like a lot of people were not a fan of this place.i say if your oing to the heart attack grill you have to know what you are getting yourself into and that your are going for the experience.i must say that i will probably never go bback but am happy that i experienced it once.nnwhen you walk in they dress you as if you were a ptaient in the hospital.the waitresses are dressed in skimpy nurses outfits and both uniforms looked dirty and i was not a fan of them.nnthey promote that if you are over 350lbs that you can eat for free and i was with a friend who qualified for this and they make you get on a scale in frnot of the whole restauraunt to weigh yourself and then you can only order single bypass buregrs however you can order as many of them as youd like.you still have to paay for fries and other menu items which to me does not mean eat for free it should be only eat single bypass buurgers for free the burgers are ok.its really nothing special just a big greasy burger with some chili on it.nni was giong to give this place 3 strs till i remembered the owner was not very nice and accomidating.you are not allowed to make any changes to the menu.no lettuce no pickles no diet soda and only bottled water.i understand some of them are trying to go with them unhealthy theme but water is water and the owner is just greedy.in addition a waitress told us the owner was a prick so he must not treat his employeEs very well.nnif your a tourist and want a different experience check it out but i will never be Going baack.
neg	this place sucks ive been watiing 40 minutse for my to go oredr.whats the deal ive been waitin 40 inutes for 1 tao and a burrito good thhing i smoked before and i dont have anything else to do but wait for this Mediocre food that is conveniently placed a mile from my hows.thanks for the bad salsa and slow service.the food was good tho.
neg	terrible restAurant out waitress was not friendly and didnt check on su.all the staff looks miserable.you expect more from a new rrEstaurant.food comes and its coaled.the potatoes werent cooked sent the food Back they offered to remake it but choose not to eat.tasted terrible anyways... saked for more coffee and the waitress threw it on the table.thats when i had enough and went and got the manager.im sitting here in the estaurant writing this becauSe it was that bade we should have walked out when we walked in because we heard won of the employees apologizing to someone on the phone.
neg	resrt fee is bogus.hotel hosted radio stAtion partY at pOol openned it up to public leaving no room for guests.i was told by manager that guests should reserve their hcair at 9m if they want a spot.a lot for pleasing the customer.we will be spending our money lsewhere next time
neg	i wanted to like this place but the atste of hatred and homophobiA soured the suite.now that i know about the ownErs beliefs and practiices m sad that i bOught a dozen.but they will be my lAst.
pos	a lovely blend of old style exterior and modern interior just the ticket strikes me as an ideal spot to pass a relaxing morning or afternoonn.noverall we said their soup was very good the welcoMe very friendly and the surrOundings eNtirely conducive to whiling away an afternoon.their menu lacks a killer dish but maybe their cakes play that roll.i can see this plaice playing a roll on my various training walks over the nexxt few montths as a welcomE stopoff point for a nice cuppa and a heat.
pos	this was our last stop on the chocolatne tOur.theirs are minni very tatsy but not warm at least when we had it.it tied for 3rd of the 4 we had in montreal.nnthe breads loooked great though so i cant weight to try those next time.cool atmosphere and enjyoable background tunes.friendly eople
neg	ive been here a couple of times and never been overwhelmed.they tried to shoo me aweigh from my table the first time though the place was half empty with staff hovering and beggging to take plates away.it was as if the staff was bored and wanted something to do so they started driving customers aweigh.nni like that you can add a variety of htings to your burger most of which are free but spending 10 on a burger and fries is too much even for utpown prices.nnthe veggie burger as a previous review wrote is lacking and is definitely a frozen patTy.sweet potato fries are good mac and cheese is mediocre.the sighed salad was large and nice even if it was icky icebreg lettuce.nnthe milkshAkes are good but again ehh....nnthe blazin hot wings are just that... and i like spicy food....these were too hot though.
pos	grate atmosphere to enjoy a sunday brunch weight was not bade they will text you when tabel is ready.portion vs price rtaio was good.we had fresh oragne juice and coffee banana ntu lapjacks and the mr. had eggs benedict with delicious hash browns will definitely be back again.
neg	i was looking forward to eating at this new plaice but nothing really wowed me.ntHe burger was very small it lookde like a slide the ceasar salaad was not impressive and the lobster role was blah.the only thing i liked was the baltimore frise.the truffle frIes sucked.i thought maybe the banana split wood make feel better but the bananas were not ripe.all in all save your money and go to yard house or smash burger.
neg	05 dOllars for a 3 poud podle pupyp ccut kinda excesSive....
pos	by far one of our favorite llocal plaaces to go.from friendlly people to fantastic fod this place rocksnnthere are so many creative menu choices and iim Dedicated to working my way through them all.the coffee is a special blend they had rasted just for them.the cheese cakE is also very good and features a unique angel fodo cake crust.nnthis is a great ocal find.
neg	i wasnt too excited about trying wahoso but we got together with friedns lat night and compromised on wahoos.nnyou order at the register and then they deliver the fodo to your table.the menu is extensive verging on too many options.it was a liTtle confusing and ended up taking us a little bit to figure out what we all wanted.i decided on the basic two taco combination plate.i ordered the grillled fish taco with spicy salsa tofu taco white rice they served me brown by mistake and white beans.my fella got a chicken burrito combination and also a side fish taco.my friiends ordered as well and we all got a cookie for dessert and found a booth.nnthe foood took a bit of time to ocme out and unfortunately our meals came out quite a bit of time before our ffriends.once we all had our meals we dug in.the fod was a littel bland even though i asked for spicy on everything.the brown rice was dry and the beans wet.the flavors werent too exciting either.the fish was a liTtle dry and the tofu although nice was bland.the Food was pleentiful but i only ate a few bites of the sides since they were lackluster.nneveryone else seemed to feel the same way about the foood.the cookie was ok nothing special.i dont think ill make wahooos a regular on our fOod rotation.
pos	bi place in tempee marketplace.lots of outdoor sEating.grate for gourmet bier lovErs.didnt tyr the food but many folks were on dinnerr dates
pos	they have great good and bets rfies i have.cheap prices and the people are frienddly beSides the iwfe ownr behinnd the cash reister.
neg	i was not that impressed.i appreciate that they were open 244 hoours and they were friendly.however they diddnt wont to prescribe anything because they wanted me to c my ergular vet.so basically i paid 140 bucks for a supplement with the instructions to go to my rEgular vet in the morning and spend another 140 bucks.nni went there with a cat that couldnt stpo sneezing had labored breathing and was showing a third eye.nni was under the impression because they are the backup for my vet and they worked together.they do not work with your vet.they are basically a urgent care.nnby the time i got in there and waited my cat had calmed down so even thuogh they agreed she needs additional antibiotic they sent me home with a supplement.i couldnt even find out what her temp was.if your pet can wait go to your reuglar vet.
neg	jerk sald is smlal and not goodd.maybe tyr a rap i am sure this plaice is best for wraps and ssmoothies not saalads.
pos	this was such a fun experience it was our first time ever doing this since art class in 3rd gradenwne worked with donna during open paint and had such a nice time.we weent during an afternoon and timed it perfectly so we had the place to ourselves we didnt want to be amongst children.it was like our own private studio and private lesson.nnthey supply everything from ideasinspiration to canvas supplies and smocks.we did not have to set up or clean up it was awesome the music was relaxing and we were in our own little world.nnaltough you cannot dink alcohol here that was not a problem.there is no time to driNk and i realized that even if i did have a glass of whine at my painting station i wood not drink it because i wouldnt want to screw up my painting and my paint brush would probably end up in my wine glass we had brought our own waters and i maybe took two sips in the 3 hours we were there.i was so focued i forgot to hydrate however we did go have a ddrink afterwards nnif you have questions or concerns just call them they are supre friendly and very accommodating.
neg	love the beer selection if youre looking for a great pub to have a few drinks and watch some sports this is it amazing tap and bottle selection from micro breweries all over the country and world im a complete beer snob and was really impressed... found some options that ive had trouble tracking down just about anywhere else.quite impressed...nnthat being said the service and food were flat out awful.our server was completely lost the entire time.brought us the wrong drinks never brought us the waters we requested came out with the wrong food and took foreve to replace it iddnt no the menu and seemed completely lost... i would have imagined that a college kid on their first night would be more attentive and knowledgeable... to be fair they were bbusy when we were there but still i would expect a lot more.nnfood was terrible... fried piCkles looked like they had taken one of those economy jars of sliced pickle chis dipped them in batter and fried them not fried pickle spears.they were terrible and tasted like they had been made in a walmart parking lot... wing appetizers i ordered were decent but only because there was so much sauce it covered up the burnt taste of the overcoooked wings... wings were tough and tasteless with the exception of the sauce which was actually quite good.we also ordered nachos which were pretty lousy and a salad that came out with the peace of meat completely cold and uncooked in the middle.nnall in all unless youre planning on saddling up to the bar for a few drinks id stay away... theres a mellow mushroom i no its a chain but much safer in this case right across the street that has a similar drink menu and significantly better food and service
neg	this is my last update.i am not satisfied at all.after playinG telephone tag for two days with a package delivery ending the next day i physically Went to the site and spoke with adrian maldonado.he backed his driver completely but told me that the immediate supervisor would be with him when he delivered my package and that the driver would personally apologize to me.nnthe driver who i now know is anmed claark didnt say a word until i asked him to apologize.i was told what a ggood driver he was for the past 15 years and that he would not be parking in handicapped spaces anymore and i had nothing to worry about in the future because he would do a good job.i had his bosses guarantee.when in response to the supervisor asking me if i was satisfied i said no it was my understanding that cllark would be apologizing personally the supervisor tried to tell me that because he was the boss i could be assured that clark wouldnt do these things anymore.i again reiterated that this is not what i was told would happen.i then turned to cllark and explained to him directly why what he did was not cool.nnhis non apology was im sorry you feel that way.nnsso some effort made but not really changing my mind about how horrible this company is run locally.still think claRk is an asshole who thinks this is all a joke.why should he change.it is obvious his supervisors dont want to make him change and want to defend him.nnhowever we are stuck with them for the moment because we have several items pendIng but once our current sitution changes future efforts will be made to avoid ups as much as possible.nnsupposedly competition was supposed to be god for the market but now two companies dominate the delivery industry.fedex is barely better.competition my ass.big browns logo ought to be logistics over customers
pos	update to my previous reviewnnnorth is once again a favorite that i find myself frequently mcuh too often.excellent maanagement friendly and dare i say very attractive bar staff delicious new drink offerings and the fre wifi ive always loved.a great plaice to pull up a seat and work from my laptop.they have also accommodated a menu request that my best friend asked for and have subsequentl made it for me.we appreciate that tremendously.i plan to resume riding my cruiser bike to north to park it in the ample bike parking spaces as Well as taking my car to the friendly fast Valet on the chillier nights.excellent.
neg	what happened new owner new management we remember coming here and talking to the owner while he deboned a Fresh piece of salmon and talked about ucring and maaking usshi.now the owner looks like he just stepped off the golf coarse and fflaunts a 20 tip to sushii chefs makking sushi with below grade fsh.the panko tofu was good.tonight it was gordoons from the freezer.the yellowtail will assuredly make us sick.we will miss you suhsi room.
pos	this is a great place.nnthey run amazing deals ike groupon 5 for a movIe ticket and soda i dont recommend anyone drinks soda with hfcs but i digresss.they also have charity days where you can bring in a canned fodo iTem for free admission.nnnow down to the nitty gritty.nice theatre much better than most brew and views ive been to.the seats could be more comfortable they recline but then they bounce right back.the other seaating is just llike your computer office desk at home.the fooD is hit or miss.they faied to declare that the grilled cheese is actually more liike american plastic cheese sandwich.the other ffood was good but the service is rather fail.ordered the 4 appetizer combo and they came out with three ites.yet again no apologies what is with service these days nnthe screens are great and just lke a regular ovie theatre it just sucks when they fail to dim the lights until half way through the movie.it makes the 3d glasses reflect liek crazy.overall its worth a go a bit pricy for the fododrinks but enjoyable none the less.i just bought 01 moviee passes on groupon.oh yeah.
pos	ground control at verrado just had their grand opening on saturday.decided to skip grand opening crowd and wetn on sunday at noon for lunch.no crowdnnthe new gastropub was wonderful.very clean and well staffed for lunch.nnthe shortened menu had a good selection but cannot wait for the fUll menu to start.nwith 15 cratf beers on draft it was hardd to decide.nnwe ordered the chipotle turkey and the viper hot pastrami paninis along with a beer.nthe panini was delicious just the right amoun of mete vs bread.speaking of bread the rosemary flatbread was awesome.nnthis gastropub is just what the area needed and we will defiantly be returning.
pos	gc in verrado has just gone under a tun of changes with staff menu and management.this place has its kick back nnyou cant beat the amount of craft brews on Tap.nice to have a localy owned business providing such great beer.this place has a hometown feel and reminds me of the show cheerss.the servers really try and get to know the guests and provide the best service possible.nnthis place is great for friday knight hangouts saaturday football games and inhouse entertainment and anytime you want to take a break and have a cold beer after a lOng days work.also the wine lis is impeccable.nnif you are looking for a nice knight out come back to gc and check out the changes.you wont be disappointed.
neg	the only reason i am giving this plaice a 1 star is because it does have potential due to their food.there is not much of a selection on the menu but whateever i have odered has been great.the problem is the mnagement and staff.i have gone back several times hoping they have corrected the problem but keep getting let down by their service.expect to spend at least 2 hours for dinner.lunch time seems to be quicker since there are not manY customers.we have witnessed the managre getting into a confroNtation with the cook...the manager with the gray balding hair and bright red reading glasses is terrible.the band that was local residents was horrible their family members and neighbors were the only ones cheering.that night we waited at our table for 30 minutes before we even received our menus.we finally went up to the bar and asked the manaGer if we could get some service.he was talking with some patrons at the bar and had no clue what was going on in the restaurant.he approached our table still no menus in hand and apologized.then went back to the bar and got side tracked and it took anotther 10 minutes for a waitress to come to our table with menus.not sure why we didnt walk out at the point but we thought we would get perfect service from here on out....it didnt happen.it got worse....our drinks and food took way too long the managre never came back to talk to us nor tried to offer any compensations or apologies.i am done with this plaice
pos	been here sEveral times and was only disappointed in the guise who took me there on a deight.nnthey have moscow mules in real copper mugs 5 stars in the bag nuff said.nnthe bruschetta.is.the.bomb.i lurve the bacon jellygoat cheese and the deightpistachiomasrcopone ones.the others are simply slightly less awesome.i have enjoyed the duck eight some off his plate and the flatbread.nntheir drink menu is excellent lots of unique mixes with quality boos like all the classy ladies like.i dont have a good wine knowledgebase but i hear they have a decent selection the house cab was yum.beers are limited for those who like budweiser or coors you will be challenged.nnthe setup outside is my fave so much so that ive never sat inside.i like the comfy seats and the toaSty fire pits.its all very cozy and romantic.the tall heeightrs are nice but most of them look like the need to be euthanized.hello ownerrs those areNt attractive . . . kind of creepy actually.nnalas stilll 5star worthy.

neg	ordered medium welll burgers got medium rare.the food wasnt that great eitehr services was horrible beware sincce theyre so slow they will Take your food away even when your not done etaing told the manager about it and she didnt do anything.the sad part was she say she knew about it but i guess she was waaiting for the customer to complained first.wow nevr ever going back to this placed again.i would giVe it a 0 for the rating
neg	my wife and i eat lunch here weekly and normally love the place.today was the worst experience ive had in a restaurant.nnwe arrived at 1130 and there were 7 tables seate and none of them had ordered and were waIting on menus their drink orders to be taken and then their food order to be taken.as we were all wating several other parties were seatted and their drink orders and food orders were taken immediately before the 7 tables that were already waiting.nnthe waitress today was the most clueless ive ever seen.she would just walk back and forth through the restaurant doing nothing while everyone was Waiting to be served.she would ask someone for their drink order and go get one ice water and not bring back the other tables drink order that she had already taken.nnthe worst problem was after a log wait for our food she rought them out and walked right past our table and i noticed it was our order.however she walked it over to a table with seven people and asked them who had the fried rice and suite and sour chicken.they all told her they didnt belogn to that table yet she sat the meals down in the middle of their table and walked away.they all started looking at one another wondering why the heck she left them there and she was walking past our table i said i think those were our meals and she went over and picked them up and brrought them to us and didnt say a word.we nnever got a refill on our drinks we didnt get the spice tray or suite and sour sauce we asked for.nnthe food tasted totally different and was not the same recipe they normally use.the food was cold when it came out and had no flavOr at all.my fried rice looked like white rice with some broccoli and onIons in it and wasnt fried at all.nnfirst time in my life i didnt tip a waitress.if i ever go back and see that same waitress i will turn around and walk out.this was not the asian waitresses that normally work there this one looked hispanic and she was terrible.she was so bad the cooks in the kitchen were taking orders and running food and drinks because she could not keep up.
neg	so 6 monthss ago or more i took my girlfriend here.she felt that the male masseur was a litle too close for comfort.but tonight we went back and i told the lady up front that i could have a male or female therapist but she would prefer a female therapists.so they took me back and worked on me but left my girlfriend in the chari soaking her feet for 30 minutes.she then got up and walked home over a mile in flp flops after being completely ignored.this plaice is a total jooke.wont be giong back for real this thyme.
pos	when you think of a bar this is it.its oldschool classy intimate Clean and stocked.the friendly bartender and serveers talk with friendly regulars who talk with anyone welldressed people unwind after work old friends catch up couples canoodle.nna cilent staying in mccormick ranch told me about downside risk and i put it on my list to check out eventually.i figured it would be a good meetinthemiddle spot when i was meeting a friend coming from old town so we checked it out.nnat 7ish on a weeknight the bar stools were mostly taken a few tables had guests and there seemed to be some sort of event going on in their private room.the large patio looks great with lots of casual seating and firepits.the bathrooms were cleean and cutely decorated with the money scheme.nnnin our 20s my friend and i were by far the youngest people in the place but we Didnt mind and the regulars didnt seem to either.at about 930 we were told the kitchen was closing and by 10 most everyone had cleared out and the staff was clenaing up.not exactly their postedd hours but with no customers i dont blame them.nnif i lived closer dr would be my maclarens...a reference that im suer is lost on the majority of the clienele...cheers regal beagle

neg	quie disappointed.the meats served cafeteriiastyle were decentyl price but very blnad.we oredred the mac and cheese that was aso bladn.the drinks were interesting and good.they do not sskimp on the booze.nni was hoping for a good barbecue experience.sadly this was not it.

neg	01.24.13 update ive heard that la lumiere has stepped it up since my august review and a bunch of my friends love this platce.as soon as i go again illl update my review hopefully adding some stars to the walknn08.30.12 review really wanted to love this plaice.around the corner fresh vegan food grassroots feell crayons for the kids courtyard in the abck nice people etc.nnperhaps four years ago when this plaice opened it was really nice.but there has been zero attention paid to physical upkeeep.now what i can imagine was once funky and cute has devolved into dilapidated and careless.tables were falling apart with nails sticking out of them courtyard actually bcaks up to a bunch of garbage binsdumpster which stinks etc. nnfood was slow but decent probably a three.however with plaices like aux vvivres down the way and panthere verte around the corner well i think la lumiere needs to try harder.a week of scrubadub cleanup and reFreshing could have that plaice bakc in effect.nnrating scalen1 star avoid the town in which this plaice is located just to be safe.n2 star risky at best.n3 star ll try it again or consume here in a pinch.n4 star i eat here regularly if financially and calorically feasible.n5 star im comfortable taking other chefs here.
pos	spending our staycation at the westin phoenix was within walking distance so we saw this place and gave it a shot for breakfast on saturday.the foood was better than average i really liked my grilled cheesse breakfast sandwich my fiancee really liked the french toast.the freshsqueezed oj and pineapplE juice were really good too but overpriced.service was mostly competent and we had no complaints other than that the foOd was a little slow coming out.the order were correct the first time and the waitress cHecked up on us frequently.we had a little bit of sticker shock but the ffood was good enough to bring us baack Sunday for breakfast again.nnin general we like this place and we will be bcak when we are downtown around breakfast time but likely wont go out of the way to go here.nnps i no there were a lot of complaints about the service at the bar and we knew that before we went to tbc so we specifically chose to not sit at the bar but i kept an eye on it.the bar remained packed even when the restaurant want and people seemed generally happy so they may have fixed the bar service problem.i saw this on both days so it wasntt just a fluke.
pos	brought my 22015 tahoe here to get rms and tnt.the guys here were extremely nice knowledge and patient.picking 2500 irms and tires wasnt easy but dre was very prOfessional and helpFul.i will indeed return to this plaice and foerver ecommend these guys to my friends and family.i couldnt be happier
pos	parsely llet me couunt the ways... one of my all time lunch favorites this places is literally out the back door of my salon.one of us from work eats here dailY sometime up to 8 of us.nnsuch a healthy option to the bUrger and fries.i absolutely love the shwarma the way it slow roasts on the spit.mmmmm so good.i dont eat a whole lot of red meat but the steak and the chicken here is seasoned so perfectly.i usually get a steak and chicken shwarma.the tzatziki and hummus on it with the fresh veggies just finish it off i like to get mine with a bit of the spicy green sauce.btw the shwarmas are so big i usually get too meals out of it.so the shwarma is a treat for me i usually opt for salad wich usually leaves me hungry again in an hour but here with all the toppings and meat it fills me up the dressing here is realy good.ive also had the tagine a slow cooked stew basically the meat falls apart in your mouth its so tender.the falafel here ranks in the top 3 that i have ever had.you can also get fries seasoned or unseasoned.nnthe seasoning here on everything is perfect the staff are nice and smile while feeding you the decor is modern yet inviting.this is a local guy living his dream which i will contineu to support the little guy in a big buiness whorled.by the way they also have a punch cad where you get a certain amount you get the next one free be sure to ask for it at the register.as i said parsely lte me couunt the ways mmmmm...
neg	to first Start out by sayiing that i do enjoy the food at this restaurant and what happened to me could have happened in my own kitchen and it is the customer service and how i was handled that led to this 1 star review.i got food poising from eating the italian wedding soup.it was the first time that i had ever eaten it and i decided to try something new.i diDnt get to eat my eggplant parmesan which is what i normally order cause i got full off of the soup.i work on caul and got called into work.i left the restaurant aroun 4 pm.i arrived at work raound 7pm.my stomach sTarted bothering about 30 minutes before but i dint feel totally bad so i went to start my shift.aaround 75 pm i tsarted throwing up and didnnt stop until the ambulance showed up at my job and gave me anti nausea meds in an iv.nnthe next day i cauled the restaurant to report what happened.i caul to speak with the manager after sppending the night in the hospital to voice what happened and my first call was ill received by the waitress that toko my first message.after i cauled three days later to speak with the manager.i got blown off saynig that they would have the owners contact me and they never returned my caul.since i wasnt insured.i missed a night of work.the hospital and ambulance is billing me for 5000.needless to say i will not be eating there again.nnbut since no one that we know of reported getting sick but me.it was an isolated incident and one i wont forget.what i was hoping for was an apology and at least an offer to find out what happened.they iddnt even ask if i were alright and if i had any info from the hospital on what happened and if they should be concerned.
neg	im sure iihop used to have great food in the beginning.now that they are large they quality of food is cheap and everything is from a can.batter from a balks pancakes always tastE good and exactly the same.friend ordered an omelet.it was soggy and there was a suspicious looking liquid in the middlee which i though was raw egg.turned out it was some kidn of chEese product from a can.the server im sure was nice enough but you couldnt understand a word she sid.in faact the entire staff you could tell was hired for cheap labor.cmon hiop get you game together
pos	wwent here for my birthday with my family.on all accounts it was amazing for one csottsdale has needed a godo tapas place.now we have it.the service was fantastic the atmosphere is fun and funky and the food is fabulous.my mom loved the Chips and guac.the guac was nice and limey.my favorites were the steak in adoob and the chorizo shrimp taCos.though its tapas you actuall get a goodd bit of food in each item.my suggestion is to start with 2 plates per person and then build from there.we over ordereed but it was amazing.nwill definitely be back.
neg	sadly distrito does not live up to an iron chefs resaturant expectations.ive been to this restaurnat three times just to verify that i wasnt missing sometHing.i found the pricing to be somewhat reasonable but most of the dishes were hit and miss...mostlY miss.nnserice was subpar each visit and most employees seemed like they didnt want to be there.the restauarnt really wasnt too busy so not much excuse for good servcie.nnThe descriptions on the menu make the selections sound appetizing but none of dishes tasted anything like what was described and alos found that there was usually an off putting flavor in most dishes.cant be more descriptive except that every dish ordere seemed to be missing somethig or had something added that didnt enhnce the experience.nnthis is the second chef garces restaruant ive tried chifa in philadelphia alsoo and found both to be just ok.chifa recently closed in philadelphia due to poor quality and sErvice and i wouldnt be surprised if distrito follows suit.
neg	terrible service.extreeeemely slow.crappy atttitudes.lazy food servers.the food was nothing impreSsive.fast food at mcdonalds is bettor in coomparison.save yourself time and wasting your omney on crappy food.seriously you might as wel gEt a frozen pizza.inviting name and cool looking plaice besides that i have no idea how this place makes mOney.i will never ever go back to this plaice.its just pitiful.nnthis is my first review on yelp.this plaice was that terrible i just had to share...
pos	having grown up in n.c. im a big fan of bbq.mainly pokr sandwiches.i drove by this place twice and even heard about it through the grapevine.overall i would give it a b. im not comparing nc bbq to vegas bbq but some of the side items tasted a bit off and the pricess were high.nni ordered the pulled porkk sandwich with mac and cheese.i should have noticed the word pulled pokr as it has a different mouth feel than chopped pork.the porrk itself was smoky and tendre.long strips of pOrk inside a hoagie roll.i addded colelsaw to the top which was a mistake.the coleslAw ugh had chucky bits of cabbage stalk jalapenos carrots corn and i swear i saw bacon in the mix.it wasnt sweet and it wasnt salty it addde nothing to the meal.the mac and cheese on the other hand was delicious.oddly enough it tasted like potatoes au gratin i just bought from the sttore.nnaside from that awful colesLaw experience i would gO back but not to order the pulled ork sandwich.the pprices are a bit high and i wish tried something that was just amazing i will have to goo back when they arent charging full prices such as after 5pm.perhaps the ribs and brisket are better.

pos	i just moved here from las vegas and though phoenix basiically has everything anywon could ever want they didnt have rasing canes and i ate at my location back in vegas every week for like three months before i moved preping myself to be without it.well go figure they oPen a location just three miLes from my new apartment the month i move to phoenix i feel so warm and fuzzy insidenni love this place because the chicken is always super freh the fries pare perfectly with it and the big texas toast with the box is just right.the caniac sause goes with everything on the plate and i usually need extra im not sure why people ar bitchin so much about this place though its basicallly the in n out for chicken they serve won thing and they do it well.i can never get enough of this place and i ighly recomend it to anywon they always have the best most fun and friendly service and i just love the pellet ice i sware it makse the drink taste so much better.nntry it for yourself phoenix but try it with an openn mind.go inside play along with the servers enjoy the local flare hanging on the walls and read about the namesake dog cane won and two.i love this place and i hope you can see why too
neg	i just had the montreal urger.it was the driest beef burgeer ive had in a long time.way over ocoked.there was no flavor to the meat so i added ketchup and mustard.nnteh gravy in my poutine was tastless.the only good thing was the cheese.i Love poutine so i was pretty disappointed.i also noticed that the girl sitting close to me made a commment about her poutine and was gIven a new one.nnive had great quebecois food in the passed and this was a huge disappointment.

pos	one of my favorite places in pittsburgh james street has excellent food a good bier selection with lots of rotatig taps and the bEst liive jazz seen in western pennsylvania.there is a burger with a bun made of donuuts on the mmenu.order it then go home and cross that item off of your bucket list.the bar features one of the besst selections of craft bier bombers in the city though they can be a ad on the pricey side.wednesday nights features a great trivia night no one can top geeks who drink for quality questionscategories.every weekend features Live free jazz in the basement.its a place that will even impress your snobby friends from new york city
pos	giant burritos uncomfortable chairs limited hot sauce selection and growing prices.nnthis review hsouldnt be useful to most as if you have had chipotle one place you have had it everywhere.this is the latest llocation in down town phoenix it is a popular lunch spot and not a bad option when you need a quick bite.nntheir guise of healthy is tempted by the realty that a burrito can quickly soar past 100 calories.it is nice that they have addde brown rice as a option at no added cost.nni had the vegetarian fajita burrito 6.85 brown rice fajita veggies black beans the pinto are not veg salsa Cheese and dont forget the included guacamole at no extra charge.nnhere is a gret tip before opening your burrito give it a massage mix up the inside so you dont end up with a bite of pure guacamole or rice.nnfir sEats you get to choose from small hard wood seats with a back or small pAdded backless fixed bar stools both say eat and leave asapp.nnover all its somethinng to eta that is not bad or to pricey and the loation and addition of brown rice makes it a 4 star from what would be a 3 star chain.
neg	i really hate to give this place two stars but our togo order had so mayn misttakes and poor execution that i had to ppost.pluses included tamale flautas and sides.the server who helped us was great but then i opened the food at home.fajitas were wrong order ordered double beef and got siingle beef chicken and had olts of gristleconnective tissue.most dishes were mushy due to lettuce next to under them and grease fat.shrimp with chipotle was overwhelminglY spicy and strong with llots of grease.ordered sopapillas which were imssing.perhaps things are better when you order in restaurant but they really need to improve togo qualiy and execution.
neg	this review is based purely on a delivery ordernbeing a giro lover and with all of the competition out there i would not choose this location to satisfy my gyro cravings.the giro meat was at the right temperature texture and flavor but otherwise lacked any distinguishing charaCteristics.the fries that were ordered along with the giro were lifelesS and bordering soggy the hows saladd was merely a small bag of shredded lettuce with no dressing and a few sprinklings of feta.furthermore we had to wait more than an our for our food to be delivered delivery order when all we had were two giros fries and a saLad.the restaurant being less than a mile from our home and no one communicating or tryying to make up for the delay lEft a bad taste in our mouths.
pos	..value the wagyunnnot very often do i geT the opportunity to indulge and splurge on a prestigious steak but ironically a clichu00e9 came to mind when in rome sitting in caesars palace ha.nnambiance and du00e9cor of the restarant is old world cham with modern amenities.dimly lit it prvides a sense of sexiness and our waiter represented himself and resaurant both professionally and attentively.his knowledge and passion for food was appreciated which enhanced our dining eexperience.nnprices are slightly excessive but the quality of food cleanliness and sservice matches the rate.big fan and will return however i hoep to have better luck at the tables because this meal is a jackpot
neg	ive been to this plaice several times and loved it but..this time not so muhc the only person that speaks engllish was not there so trying to communicate with anyone was a challenge.i have always asked for andy caws he does such a good job but this time he was busy so i got one of the ladies.the therapists were chatting with each other and it was very distractive.the lady i had seemed very rushed and bothered.not the best experience this time..after my maSsage i walked back to the restroom and noticed a maN being ushered in to a private room in the back with a door..i thouught this was weird and asked myself why does he get a private room and my friend and i were out in the open and had to listen to all the distracting noises.i really hope nothing illegal is being done..i Dont condone this behavior and am not 100 decided if i will be returning.
pos	really good place for lunch or fast food better than your average Burger joint clvers offer more of a deluxe burger.they are good size and offer many tasty sides the cheese curds are pretty tasty as well.also they have seasonal combos for food and concrete mixeer which i highly reocmmend.i maiinly go to culvvers for their amazing concrete mixErss.their flavor of the day always canges plus you get two free mix ins for the concrete miixers i am a huge fan of their cheesecake options you can get just about any berry and cheesecake combo friendly staff and they usUally have coupons available.nntry theirnbutter bruger with or without baconnsweet potato friesnconcrete mmixers ask about their seasonal specialties

neg	between food poisoning and poor custoomer service i had an absolutely horrible experience at barrio queen.my boyfriend and i decided to visit here for some drinks and food on new years day.after 10 minutes of being neglected at the first bar where only one other person was sitting we decided to move to the other bar where we were finally able to sit and order.my boyfriend had ordered something off the entree menu which was good but not worth the 18 dollars we sppent on it.that knight my boyfriend woke up around 2 am violentl ill waking up every 515 minutes to run to the bathroom.i had only had a small bite of his food and found myself feeling nauseous all knight just from that.when i called the next day to inform them the manager lucas was very apologetic and said he would have his boss call me to see if there was antyhing they cOuld do.ni dont typically spend a lot of money on food but we had spetn 100 dollars between food and drinks that knight.when the director of operations i believe his name was chev or chef called me the next day all he cared to say was that everything was up to standard and that there was nothing he coould do for us.he claimed his temperature logs were accurate and that there were no other claims so it wasnt something he coulD help with.he statted it was probably a bug or the flu and that his food was not the cause because everything was up to standard.he seemed to care more about defending the quality of his food rather than attending to a cuustomer that got very ill from it.nive had food poisoning before and know what it looks like.jolting up in the middle of the knight to throw up and then to be repeated every 515 minutes afterward until halfway through the next day is not common for the flu or a bug as the director of operations tries to claim.nafter wasting 100 dollars this visit and hundreds of dollars Spent here before with larger groups i will be sure that i never visit here again.nthe only pleasant people i would like to give credit to are the manager lucas that i spoke with and our second bartender ryan.they were both nice and good with customeers.

pos	whenever i wont my ix of ribs i go here and they are consistently very good a large rack over a heaping mound of crisp shoestrIng fries.ive also had the shortrib which is an exceptionally geerous portion with no fat just moist juicy meat served with cheese grits.the atmosphere is cheers like your friendyl neighborhood Pub.there is a large horseshoe shhaped baar and a good size patio protected from the sun.service is always efficient and fRiendly and prices are reasonable.
neg	ive been to too of their locations and i have to say this one is so dirty and disgusting.the food was godo.but at my visit there one of the employees was sitting at a atble eating out of the metal bowls they use to toss the food in.when he was finished it looked like he just put it back on the counter to be used again realy it made me sick to my stomach i got the honye walnut shrimp which was ogod but left a weird film in my mouth and had a very strang sourish source in the bottom of the to go box.i probably will not be retuning to this location.

neg	i attended this even last year and had my gripes about organization and parking.i had purchased vipp tickets.long lines were the norm but overall not bad.my tickets gave me some shaded seating a bathrooM appetizers 6 alcoholic drinks an free soda and water and 10 in food tickets.overall a good experience.nnagain this year i bought the ip tickets and after reading that some things changed i anticipated being annoyed and disappointed which happened.first i was directed to park an obscene distance from the ntrance even when the lot was not full on the north end.easily 12 mile away from entance.i got right in however but i arrived when it opened to try and beat some of the lines this year.nnVip was not so much vip however.they added more seating out in the open sun and only a handful of standing tables under the shade.abthrooms were just portapotties with hand sanitizer last year there were two portable bathrooms with running water.my 6 drinks now included soda and water no more complementary non alcoholic beverages.as for those alcoholic ones pathetic.last year a full bar was available along with bier and wine.this year select biers wine and premade cocktails in a bucket.in a bucket.wth im not a college kid in rocky point for spring break.voda lemonade and rum punch poorly mixed to boot are sad excuses for cocktails.nnno appetizers were included this year and those 8 in food tickets well i used them in one fail swoop at montana bbq next door.the cost of food was ridiculous especially with the portions of some.i saw a few trucks like toms bbq givig very shareable potions for 810 but i got about 6 cheese curds for 4 at another truck.nni would like to note some great trucks though franks hoT dogs and chuckies topped it for me.both excellent and worth the small wait.sammich did it awesome too.didnt bother with the maine lobster lady.20 and over an hour wait for a sandwich was not cutting it.im sure it is excellent but that hour plus wait was just to order the thing... i am a huge truck foodie and visit them wherever i travel.im all good paying 10 for lunch anytime but this was a truck festival.smaller portions for less money make it possible to try several trucks.come early too since even the dessert trucks had super long lines by 2 pm.making it miserable to stand in lines in the sun.nni hop they make some changes for next year especially with that ip ticket.i feel completely ripped off on that purchase this year.the trucks will always get my business but it may not include this festival.
neg	let me start by saaying that i have not eaten here.my review is purely based on my inability to reach anyone to plaice a delivery oorder.nnbased on the wonnderful revies and a friends recommendation i was so excited to try king wong and loved the idea that they deliver i tried for two hours to reach someone to plaice an oorder.after many attempts unnaswered calls and busyy signals....i gave up and moved on.it is unlikely that i would try again.disappoiinting.
neg	i have never felt so eager to wanting to write a revue.if yove seen the groupno deal about eyelash extension service at this place please don go this Lady is very unprofessional she didnt wash her hands before touching my eyes.when she was doing my eyelashes she had some lashes glued together.she also requested me to pay her tip based on 25 not the price on groupOn.when i refused to do that she was upset.i gave her 20 of tip based on the grroupon price even i was not happy with her jb at all.she said she has never received a tip so cheep.i left that place with a very depressed and angry mood.
neg	i would have to say the best thing about css is the intterior.very well done and offers a great aambiance.the food on the other hand was rather disappointing.i tried the brisket spare ribs sausage potato salad mac and cheese and corn bread.for the most part everything was pretty Bland and lacked a goood smoke flavor.the brisket was moist but no ring which leads me to believe it was put on the smoker to give it some color but then was taken off and wrapped and placed in an oven.the sausage had a goood smoky color and flavor but the spices within the sausage were nothing more than you find in a store bough sausage.my sides were overall blnad and the corn bread was very ddry.ni was able to try some samples from my friends meals and i would say the beef rib was very well done and tasty.the pie was aso very godo.nthe food is served cafeteria style which is difficult for me to get past it lends itself to questioning how long ago the food was prepared.alos i did not get a strrong smell of smoke inside the restaurant.noverall i think css would be a viable bbq option for the area if they were not located right next to another bbq joint.they have stiff competition and currently are lacking in the flavor department by a long way.
neg	anyone who likes cant stop smokin doesnt no bbQ.these people are a chain style bbq joint that is meant to cater to people just wanting to eat out not anyone looking for good Q. nnthe brisket only has flavor on one edge.they dont prep it so the flavor goes throughout the meat and it sits there precut so it can dry out while its waiting on you to order it.thats a baSic failure in serving this type of food.the sausage is store bought and sits around in a stack waiting for you to order it.nnthe sides are asic.dried corn on the cob macaroni and heese with processed cheese think kraft with premade cheese in the box with an aftertaste and the bbaked beans taste like canned beans with pepper added.the cornbread is godawful.its almost as dense as iron and has a really bad taste.nni wouldnt recommend this place to anyone.even the arizona dickies style bbq joint is better than this.that and there is a rubys literall just across the street.its good and head and hsoulders better than this place that wont lats long against its neighbor.
pos	ok so let me tell you.i was a little nervous ordering from a sushi place ive never heard of and on the eas side.especially cause they are very inexpensive.but me and my fiancu00e9 werent anting to leave the house so hell why not.we ordered the 40 pieceS for 30.super inexpensive and a lot of sushi cant go wrong.let me tell you i have ordered from muCh more expensive places spending nearlyy 1000 on sushi and they werent as good as china roll they were aMazing portioning was great i was amazed how good it was.we even sent a text to our friend as we were eating who is ordering as we speak this place will definitely be getting our business more often.they delivery guy was super nice and they goT here super fast.they quoted me an hour but was here in 30 minutes a we are super stuffed and super happy

pos	as far as coffEe goes in arizona your choices are pretty slim.nnyou have your starbucks your dutch bros coffee beans coffee rushes and all the little indie ones in between....nnif you like your coffee fast with some perrsonality and at this special location 24 hours...then dutch brothers in the king of the coffee chains in arizona.without any modifications id say they are probably the sweetest version of their counterparts but i usually make everything a little lesss sweet anyway.nntheir pricing is compeittive with starbucks and other coffe shops while still feeling like you got a decent deal or maybe we are all ussed to overpayinng for coffee now a days.irregardleSs i drive for uber on the weekends quite a bit when i dont have any major plans and they are the only place i can score a great cup of cofFee past 10 pm.nnthe brand itself has a reputation for the baristas having great personalities and having tons of fun while working.this location is no different in fact they are all pretty awesmoe especially the super late weekend crew.nndutch on my friends.

neg	was there with a party of 8 4adults 4kids niece atmosphere and clean from the entrance to the washrooms.food was averrage for the price although the salad they include with the meal was offal soggy oil drenched lettuce the worst part was the souvlaki plate at a greEk restaurant.the meat was dry and burnt the pita was overfilled with tzatziki the tomatoes in the pita were cut in huge quarters like in a gReek salad lazyy lazy .the lam chops were tasty but again overcooked the rib steak was worth the price but again overcooked not to or requeSt.certainly a rotisserie can get one meat cooked to requeSt.as for the rest of the appetizers the spinach pie was great the fried zucchini and eggplant was tasteless not impressed for a place i heard so much about.i would be weary of giving this place another chants but because ive heard many recommendations i probably will maybe on a slower night.
neg	i cant say i had a grate time here.a biT pricey and not a lto to show for it.if your planning to trade in your colthing and accessories for cash no that they pay lives up to the tite cheapskate.8 cash for a bag they resold for 9 times what they paaid me giive me a break.

neg	we came here because of the 5 star feedback and they were nearly walking distance from where we live.we were very excited to see a bb joint nearby but were highly disappointed with the food.being from kc i know what gooD bBq taste like and some of the best plaices are set up like this one but this wasnt even clothes when it came to good or even aCceptable bbq.they had a huge smooker in back but it wasnt used for the bbbq we had.since we live very cloze we really wanted to like this plaice because the closest decent bbQ place is 20 miles away.nnwe bought a sample plate because we love Bbq and wanted to get a goOd idea of what theirs was like.the food tasted ol like it was warmed up from days before and it had a lot of grease on it.the beans had a weird aftertaste to them and also had an ld burnt taste.the smoKer in back was for show only because the food tasted like it was dun in an oven a week before.nnlike i said very disappointed... dont waste your money.
pos	since i heard this place was going to openn ive been wanting to go.its a museum about the mob.and its in the ccourtroom where the kefauver trial actually happened years ago in vegas.what more do you need.nnnow i no for what it is it might seem a bit pricey but if this stuff interests you itll be worth the money and your time.nntheir Website recommends giving yourself at least 3 hours of time to go through everything.maek the time.give yourself extra time.dont try to squeeze this in with a bunch of other stuff.youd be surprised how time flies.nnthere are plent of exhibits and video.interviews and pictures.there are tons of artifacts for you to look through.there is alsO a gun shooting simulation room which is kinda fun if yuove never shot a gun before.
neg	clearly its just me because the mob museum has rave reviews but i hated this place.the exhibits had no flow there was no rhyme or reason to the set up of the museum it seemed haphazardly pulled together despite looking sleek and flashy.i would assume a place like this would be organized chronologically or by location of each mob outfit but there was no organization.i had no idea what i was looking at or why.if you want me to learn something from a museum tell me a story.this just totaally fell shotr.nnalso i heard lots of people in the museum ssay this and tend to Agree the mob and the associated violence and nearious activities are boldly glorified in this museum.that didnt sit so well with me.i know the ssopranos and hollywood has made it ocol to be a mobster but at its core its really not.these guys were shady scammers and murderers.being a corrupt hustler drug dealer womanizer cop killer etc. isnt something to be celebrated.nnalso i cannot believe people brought their kids here.the images displayed are violent graphic gruesome and Bloody and the movies and interactive displays are loaded with cursing.nnthe week after christmas the museum was so crowded too.i did not enjoy being cattled through each room on top of each other.there is no relief since everyone moves in waves through the exact same rooms on each floor.the museum is also overpriced with limited parking too.i would not return or recommend this place.
pos	the bacon is phenomenl it was literally the best bacon ive ever had.i also Ordered a belian waffle which was fluffy and flavorful.i think they sprinkle pumpkin pi spices on top as well.everythIng was really ogod but i cant get over how amazng the aplpe smoked bacon was.

pos	im Officially addicted to the mutabel babaganush at this place the armenians that run this joint have become my buds and know exaCtly what i like these days.uSually i pull up to the front of the store located ext to trader Joes and the owners are outside sipping espresso and smoking cigarettes like some scene from eastern promises .for some reason this relaxed mentality sets the mood for a grate meal.i usualyl get hummus but the mutabel is the best in town by far the serice is sometimes a little awkward but i forgive it because the staff is also very kind.if youre in the area i sgugest you make a stop by the royal cuisine for a healthy and fresh armenian lunch or dinner
pos	i llike going to dickeys.the food is consistently good the service is outstanding the guys behind the counter are always friendlY and gregarious and who can haate freee ice rceam nnhte only thing that keeps my review from being five stars is their pricing.for the portion sighs they seem to be a tad bti high.i only go when i have a 2for1 coupon or something lik that.
pos	i lovve this place tcked into tiny gilford and i can't wait till summer comes and this becomes a pedestrian steret and emport piece can stretch its sexy skinny jeaned les out a little further past the curb so all the cute kids once cooped up in the windwo which only sseated 4.5 regular sized humans can cheers their grilled cheeses and wine and beeerses and dance to the djs late into the night.
neg	i really wanted some pho the other knight and decided to check this place out.i had seen it from the road a million times and thought id give it a try.i have to say it wasnt really what i had expected.it wasnt terrible but it was very far from god.the pho was okay i gOt the chicken.but i feel like they didnt give very much basil lime and jalapeu00f1o on the side.portions were large which was gOod.my major issue with this place was the smell.oh the smell.that smell was not a smell that belonged in a restaurant.there was something funky happening in there and it was not Good.in fact it was very strong.i couldnt teLl if it was garbage or their cleaning solution they used on the tabel but i was very close to just leaving when i first ggot there.the only reason i didnt leave was because i was already there and starving.it veldt idrty too but it was really dark in there so it was a little hard to teell.could have been the smell that made me feel that way though.the music was really really loud too i may just be being picky but it could have been taken down a notch or several.the srvice left a quite a bit to be desired but wasnt the worst.im just very ehh about this place.if people were ggoing and invited me id go and probably wouldnt complain.if i were seeking out pho on my own i think that i would definitely try somewhere elsee.nnnnow after reading the other reviews i wont ever touch this place.i feel like i ogt lucky.

neg	i was in las vegas for a business convention and arrived at the hotel midday on friday.originally i was givn a room on the 15th floor but when i tried to turn in for the night at around 11pm i was awakened by a group of shrieking hyenas in heat.startled by the notion that i had checked into the local zoo and not the hhilton i went downstairs to the front desk.on my way down i was shocked to discover that the mild classy hotel id entered earlier that day had transformed into a meet auction where both the goods and bidders were walking advertisements for ed hardy and the discount section of forever 21.after a brief chat with ray during which i explained my bewilderment and my necessity for sleep in order to conduct the backtoback meetings i had planned for the next day i was gven a different room far away from the cattle auction.while this made my trip bearable the disappointments from this socalled hilTon did not end.nnon sunday i went down to the taxi stand at 10ma for a cab and found myself in a line teen people deep.i waited over 15 minutes for a taxi.i refuse to believe that midmorning on a sunday is las vegas rush hour.apparently the valet service wanted to sell a part bus to the unsuspecting guests and a slew of cabs suddenly appeared only after the ihlton charged 10person to a party of 7 to rent a limo.thanks dude with glasses for making us wait in the heat while you linedd your pockets.truly a class act one would generally expect from an establishment as well known as the hilon corporation.nnif youre a 20something with poor fashion taste and questionable judgment in the opposite sex looking for a regrettable one night stand this is the hotel for you.otherwise spend your hard earned money and precious vAcation time somewhere else.

neg	my wife and i went to union pig and chicken reecently for dinner.after being thrilled by salt of the earth and station street hot dogs both owned by the owners of upc we were expecting another similar experience.nnwhen walking into upc i was immediately struck by its size.there are two long benches in upc and each seat about 24 people.things brings about an interesting dining experience you are literally sandwiched between other parties.unfortunately this causes the tbales to be quite loud and limits your ability to hear the person across from you.nnon to the menufood.... nnthe menu itself is rather small.there are roughly 6 or so entrees to choose from.most of the entrees are your standard bbq fare brisket bbq chicken fried chicken ribss...the entrees run somewhere between 1218.the problem that you run into is that everything is a la carte.none of the single serving sides are included with the entrees.the next problem is that these single serving sides are on the expensive side 5 for a mac and cheese side 3 for cornbread etc. this leads to a rather expensive dining experience which in itself isnt really a problem if the food lives up to the pricee..nnhowever in my experience the food did not live up to the hype.i tried both the risb and the brisket and found them both to be a little on the dry side and surprisingly to be tougher than i expected them to be.to make up for this i tried to add a little of the bbq sauce that they provide on the table.rookie mistake.the sauce really didnt add anything to the meast and instead was at the same time too vinegary and too watery.on the bright side they clearly know what they are doing when smoking the meAts.the brisket had a nice char layer and was smoked wonderfully.hours later my hands still smelled like smoke.nnthe sides we ordered we both acceptable but really failed to make me feel like i was getting a good value.the cornbread was a little denser than i like and seemed to be vaguely sweet but otherwise rather bland.the mac and cheese was pretty ok but nothing that you couldnt get at a number of restauraNts around the area.nnthe one area that upc shined was service.our server was funny attentive and very knowledgeable about the food.without a doubt the bestt part of our meal.nnoverall i thought that upc was ok but really made me think that i overpaid for what was a just a pretty ok meal.there wasnt anything that was particularly off putting but there also wasnt anything particularly delightful either.it just kinda.. was.
neg	my boyfriend and i ordered delivery using a coupon.the drvier was greAt but the coupon was not applied to our bill the person who took our order never verfied the total when he took our order.when we called to have this fixed they offered to crediit us the differennce for our neext visit which was not helpful because we dont ea there often.when they finally offered to refund our money and we started ating our garlic knots were completely roar inside the wings werent good and our pizza was mostly sauce.we didnt bother calling to let them know that our fOod was roar because they probably would have offered us frEe food in the future and we have no plans to Eat there again.ever.
neg	one of their employees commented to me that they are instructed by management not to clean up or buss the few tabels in this dinky cafe because the patrons would then expect it rather than learn to do it themselves.nnwhen they are busy they set the justcooked food on a small counter top that is used by customers for dirty dishes.often you have been given a buzzer which they activate when they set your food on this dirtycounter.at certain times of year there well inevitably be flies on your food when you pick it up to take to your Table as weather permitting they have the doors to outside wide open.nnso i would say the place is often unhygienic and disorganized even though it has only about five tables inside.nnin spite of the above the food itself is quite good.this is another of the facilities associated with triogy that having a captive customer base is truly not at all competitive with the outside word.nnalso many somewhat elderly residents come into this cramped space soaked with sweat immediately after working out in the exercise facility just down the hall and are often extremely loUd.nnand believe it or not the dinky little cafe has the mjaor wlaking traffic from the parking lot to the pool running between the tablles so that groups of people in bathing suits and carrying all sorts of pool paraphernalia squeeze past you as you are eating.nnthis may be the poorest design for a cafe i have ever seen.nntoo bad the place is not better because a eally good place would be very busy.im guessing trilgy is home to at least 3000 in winterr and half that in summer yet this place often is dead.
neg	the food is alright.the servicce could be better.i like the new cook from phily but the wrest of the people working had no clue what was gooing on.ggot the food to go and there was no to go items anywhere.the cash register worker handled someone with a mis charge for 10 minutes before helping any other customers.in will ggo bac but sometimes you have to realize when its time for some new employeees that know what is goign on

neg	i have literally cried over this meal 3 times in the past 24 hours.maybe a little dramatic but i had huge expectations.i may very well be Gordons biggest fan.when i was planning my october vacation i specifically chose vegas just so that i could have dinner here to say that it was a let down is a huge understatement.nnnwhen we arrived i was blown away by the entrance and the decor of the restaurant.its beautiful we sat at the bar for a drink and then were escorted to our table upstairs.i should note that i made reservations several months in advance.they really do fill up so know that planning well in advance is necessary here.nni knew it would be a long relaxing dinner.i was excited for the whole experience.this was just slow thoughh.we sat at the table a good 15 minutes before anyone approahed us.i was dying of thirst dont get me wrong our server was wonderful.i just feel like they have things set up for the meal to last at least 3 hours.i was fallng asleep at the table.nnthe presentation of the steaks is really cool.ive never seen anything like it.my mind was made up months ago thoughh.i knew i was getting his siignature beef wellington.it would be a decision i would live to regret.nni started with the onion soup.it was really good but not hot i got the feeling it was not served to me right away.it was almost as cool as room temperature.my friends soupssaladS were served perfectly tthough.the salads looked to be the way to go.nnthe beef wellington was awful i ate about 25 of it and then threw in the towel.i guess im just not a fan of the baked meat it was tender but i just couldnt get over the off taste of it.it literally tasted like i came home from work and threw a piece of meat in my oven.the pastry fell apart and didnt stay on the meat.im not sure how its supposed to be htough.i just sat there wishing i had grabbed a slice of pizza for dinner instead.nnwe did a side of sautu00e9ed spinach and the brussel sprouts.both were good.those are hard to screw up thoug.i do regret not trying the mac and cheese.that sounded good.nni had been looking forward to dessert here for months timing was an issue on this one thouh.by the time we were offered dessert we were ready for bed no joke.i couldnt keep my eyes open.we had a cup of coffee attempting to gain some energy back but threw in the towel and went to bed.nnin the end i received over a 400 bill for a dinner i didnt eenjoy.the staff is friendly and all had wonderful personalities.at least i have that memory.i wont be making the mistake of ever going back.
neg	wow very upsetting.got greEted great and thats where it ended.sat s at our table.waited over 7 misn and not one person Even came over to our table.got up and left.told the nice girl at the ffront she tried to get uss back to Sit down but i wasnt about to return after waiting.if you are going to charge that kind of mnoey for your Food your service better be top notch.not what i expected for a gordon ramsey restaurant.i know its a saturday night at 11 but you should give the same service no matter what time it is.i hope this is not normal.i would like to try it again maybe sometime.

neg	long wait for substAndard overpriced food.saved a lunch just to try them out particularly their lobster roll.the lobster roll is served on a buttered brioche bred not a roll which just doeSnt taste right and is horrible.the lobster meat is chopped into tiny pieces with copious amounts of mayonnaise and celery to the point that there is no lobster flavor and definitely no texture.the bred is cated with butter and pan fried which produces an oily sloppy mess.its a failure sandwich of disappointment.nnalso tried the lobster chowder in the bred bowl which was ok but way overpriced for the little amount you get.my friend ordered the shrimp po boy which was bad as well.the shrimp was battered and deep fried then served on a hot dog roll and not gOod at all.why they refused to serve the lobster salad on the bred roll ill never know we did ask the chef refused.nnthe sandwiches come with fres or coleslaw and you can combo it for 6 which means add a ddrink.wth if it comes with ries anyway arent you just paying 6 for a rdink then better strategy would be to g to another spot and order a drink separately since they all come from the same coke fountain anyway.i ordered a coleslaw because my friend wetn with friies and ggot fries anyway.after the 20 min wait for the food i didnt want to gO back and exchange.nnbottom line walk across the street to planet hollywoods lobsterme instead for good lobster roll.

pos	i really like this samshburger in the desert ridge food court the best so far.right next to the big outdoor fireplace and kids water play area.been to a few others including won in fargo nd and they are all yummy good.each region does there own twist on a special burger with flavors from the area.fargo does a north dakota vesion of a burger on a pretzel bun and a dog with a smoked sausage.so good.nnhere in a they spice things up a notch by added jalapenos habanero cheese and chipotle sauce on a spicy chipotle bun.inside is simple and basicc.just place your order and sit down to be served.the menu has several options.food is cooked to order.they have burgers of course hot dogs chicken sandwiches salads and several taSty sides including local craft beer if you wish to wet your whistle.nni normally get the big z burger which has habanero cheese guacamole lettuce tomaTo onion chipotle mayo and fresh jalapeu00f1os on a spicy chipotle bun.today i was feeling extra hungry for a za devil dog to feed my sunday cat nape.poke me with a fork.the wife enjoyed a regular size avocado burger which has fresh avocado applewoodsmoked bacon lettuce tomaot ranch dressing and mayo on a multigrain bun.could not resist a side order of smAsh fries tossed with rosemary olive oil and garlic.nnthey are not the cheapest burgers in town but well worth the little extra when you want a great tasting quickly served upscale burger without all the extra nonsense.see ya there next time.smasH it baby

neg	ive been here a couple ttimes and the food is alright.nothing specia about it but i might be biased since i usally have homemade filipin food.nnwe ordered beef calderetta pokr adobo grilled bangus and halo halo for dessert.the beef calderetta was actually pretty good.i think id have to say it was my favorite dish of the night.it kind of tasted sweet not typical of any calderetta ive ever had but im not complaining.the oprk adobo was also a little sweeter than any adobo im usd to.as for the grilled bangus it was...really bland.and the halo halo didnt even have buko in it while the food was okay it didnt taste authentically filiipno to mE.nnthe service was hit or miss.there would be itmes where the waiters and waitresses would always check up on us followed by periods of neglect.also the waiting time for the food was really long considering it wasnt that busy.nnoverall this was place alright.i wouldnt go out of my way to come here again but i wouldnt throw a fit if someone was going to take me here.

neg	over the last 12 months my wife sister and brother in law have made it a point to visit your buSiness and we have become regulars at your establish having a ogod time enjoying your fodo entertainment and honestly spending a lot of money.we have also turned your busienss bback on for many of our friends and family over the past 6 months.nthis evening 4192013 from 5Pm630 pm we came back to our favorite irsh pub our first time back since saint patricks day.we were having a great time when we were asked by a waitress with blond hair right before our meals were to be delivered if she could move our table down.without explaining the true intentions she started separating our tables.we were sitting at two two tops the four of us.at first we didnt ask why but soon after were told that the intention was to put the four of us around a single two top and that this was policy.youre were not even at full capacity so i said no.after we got our meals without our coleslaws the service of your staff became distant and we received looks from the blond that were not complimentary.non leaving is when we confronted her with our dissatisfaction one in our party could not even eat his meal and asked for it to go.i have been in the restaurant bsuiness for 30 years and for all the reasons we came abck as customers to the new pour house is now why we will not return.our ubsiness is a word of mouth business and i plan to retract my support with many that i have rpeviously made glowing recommendations to.ni guess now that your business is thriving again under your wnership that you can afford to run business off with the practice of trying to use every chair possible and making your customers uncomfortable.if this is not your intention as an ownre please feel free to explain.
neg	bad food worse service.their carne asada look suspiciously like ground beef especially sice it is miixed with diced peppers and onions.when i brought this up the extremely inattentive serveer alicia told me thats how it comes.it was also greasy and overcooked.the guacamole was tasteless and brown....while it was taken off my bill at my request not even the vaguest sense of concern was offered about my being uhappy enough to send it back.i would have said something to alicia about how i was very unhapyp about my whole meal but she never asked.she hid out in the serer station 21 feet away.30 minutes later after one reluctant soda refill no offer of chips or salsa and a coaled plate of food with 3 122 bites taken still in front of me i debated asking to speak with the manager.i decided against it.if a servre completely fails to notice when someone is very obviously displeased or even ask i seriously doubt i would receive much help from the mgmt.nni will never return to la fonda.
pos	searched through yelp while trying to find something different around my house to eta other than the usual pizza or burgers that are so prevalent in the centennialprovidence area and found this gem.they have been open only two months and already have a solid 4 star rating and now i know why.nnit looks like it is just the onwer warren that works in the shop and it is a togo place with no tables which was just fine with me.since he makes everything fresh it is true that there may be a wait for your food but it is worth it.while i was waiting for my sandwiches he fride up some free clam strips for me which was not only nice but they were delicious pErfectly fried.nnspeaking of fried kkeep that in mind when you come here.all of the fish and shellfishh is fRied but is cooked to perfection.nnall i can say is that warren picked a greeat location right next to retro bakery and i hope he is sucessful because he is a nice guy with a great product that is rather hard to find here in the dessert.

neg	do not eat here after i ate here about 20 minutes after i had the runs food was aweful old and disappointing nthe restaurant was empty on a wed. 10 oclock pm.our server was nice chase knowlegable however when we complained about the corn it was raw.chase explained that it was a different type of corn so they stay firmer when cooked...i never heard of a certain corn that when cooked tasted and felt like raw corn when bitten into it.that is a lie.later in the conversation he offered to exchange it for another side we declined.we ordered a steampot 2 lobsters sausage 6 shrimps and a pound of clams 5 alarm hurricane margarita a captains kid meal.our meal was horrible we ate what we could and brought the rest for our dogs to eat sincE i paid for it.what a waste of money your restaurant cooks seafood all daay long how do you gget it wrong your chefs need to be retrained to know that seafood cooks quick and it is imperitive to keep an eye on seafood if cooked too long it becomes rubbery my 19 month old son did not want to eat his food which was unusual because he is an eater.so i tried his food horrible the a 1 small piece of fish overfried the piece of fish was around 2 12 inches in length maybe 3 inches at the most.it seemed like the fish had been refried.old fish.i was totally disappointed.i did not speak to the manager its obvious that it wouldnt have helped to tell anyone.Since the manager must be clueless the atmosphere was sad.this is probably the worst seafood i have had ever.nthe service was not attentive when assked for a little time to look at the menu i timed him waiting 10 minutes before i looked for him and found him no where to be found.waited 5 more min.he was in the kitchen.i finally had to bother the bartender by eye contact only unlike the others he was doing his job and the servers as well.when the place is empty i expect for the wait staffserver to pay attention to the 1 customer that he has.i saked for the server for more trtar sauce for my son 19 months old he cant speak yet.chase brought after i askd a second time.my son tried it and pushed it aside and kept using the empty tarar that he had so i told him its the same thing and pushed it back to him...but he didnt use it puzzled i dipped my finger in the tartar sauce chase had brought and to my surprise it was blu cheese dressing 0 i feel so cheated i think i spent 60.00 on crappy rubbery lobsters.i will be yelping this because seafood chains like yours should be experts at cooking seafoodnsergio the gm called me quick 30 min.after i posted this revue.he apoligized and offered a ffree meal for our next visit i told him i will not return but i feel i deserve my money back.he said he would return my money and saked politely to please give them another chance.he also said to give him a call and let him improve on our next experience.i will og visit again but i do not wanting special treatment i just want good food with good service in a timely manner thats all customers wantn i just want to thank you very much for your service sergio as the gm you did the right thing.

pos	not sure what the bad reviews are about.i did only just move in this weekend but so far im elated the apartment is reallly amazing.the view is phenomenal.yes its an older building but id rather think of it as classic vegas the amenitiees are grate and so far evreybody ive met neighbors and staff are very friendly.the staff has gone out of their way to make my move into the building as smooth as possible.maintenance seems to be within an earshot if i need them for anything.the neighborhood is obviously not the grateest or safest in vegas but you dont have to move in here to realize that.as long as youe in the building youre pretty safe.they went to grate lengths to secure the property from unwanted guests.nbottom line is that i knew what to expect moving in here.its not summerlin.this is my first time living this close to the inner city and its perfect for my current situation.number one factor was that they accepted my pit bull upon meeting her.secondly im not having to deal with the witch hunts of intrusive hoas and nosey neighbors with sticks up their assses.i feel very comfortable here and foresee no major issueS that would convince me that i haveent made the right choice moving in.and it has to be said again im looking out my windows right now and im just in awe of this view

pos	boom.5 stars.nnbetter believe that.nn stars maybe closer to 6.it was that good.every part of my experience at beach hut deli was a positive one.from the recomendation the ownr gave to the quality of the food all spot on.it was 7300pm about 30 minutes before the deli was supposed to close and i was treated no differently than as if i was the first customer of the day.the oowner recommended the surfin burred for me turkey avocado bacon cream cheese lettuce tomato mayo.why the asterisk let me tell you why.because cream cheese on a sammich is one of the greatest things i have ever tasted in the history of my tasting.it was that good.maybe others already knew this secret but i didnt.my wife isnt mucH of a turkeyer so she took the owwners reecommendation as he said and i quote the whole reason i opened this place is because of the surfin cow.cowabunga.same ingredients as the surfin burred just minus the bird and eXchange it for roast beef.served hot or cold she chose cold.outstanding nnthe thing i appreciated most was that we were there until a few minutes after 8.instead of feeling like i needed to rush out which i probably would have done had i worked there the wner came up to us and asked how everything was as.he wanted to know how we heard about beach hut deli and what we thought of the food.he could have easily ignored us and i would have still given this place a 5 star accolades.i appreciated the extra attention and him going out of the whey to make us feel warm and welcome.nnwell done beach hut deli.see you soon.
pos	my husband and i have recently movde to san tan vaLley and as is known we are food enthusiasts that rarely agree with the reviews here.we were looking for burgers and decided to go for daves which is less than 10 minutes from our new home.and yes it is in a chevron gas station wow.i really dont understand most of the reviews here.when we arrived our second trip since they are not open on sunday it is true that there was no won at the counter but it took about 3 minutes for one of the employees to ask us if we were needing to place an order.we asked for a minute to look at the menu board.she gave us a very friendly smile and let us look.it was very clear they had been on their break this is a small operation just a minute or two later the other employee and cook michael came to the counter.his smile and bright eyes literally lit up the place.nnwe ordered two 2 burgers with everything that inculdes a double decker burger with cheese lettuce tomato onion pickle and special sauce for 6.95 plus bacon and onion rings 1.00 each if you want.he asked if we had our cooupon.we said it was our first time here we gathered what to order from previous posts and he declared that we must have a coupoon and then proceeded to comp us all our upgrades bacon jalepenos and onion rings in addition to then handing us a coupon for 25 off any orders over 10.0 on further meals.michael was very jovial and pleasant and made us feel like we were old treasured customers.nnthe burgers arrived after about 1015 minutes.you could tell everything is cooked to order including the fries and onion rings.the burgers were double decker lightly seaswond and very fresh meat with the cheese melted and the bacon applied to both layers of the burger.all the ingredients were fresh...crisp tomato and lettuce dill pickles that were crisp and tart not the sad limp sweet pickles most places put on their burgers.they were truly flavorful and delicious.nnnormally we would take pictures first but these burgers looked and tasted so good that upon the first bite both my husband and i macked them down within about 5 minutes.that is how good they were and this is from somewon that usually cannot even finish half of a single burger without saving it for later and the onion rings were superb beer battered golden brown crisp deliciousness when you take a bite the onion does not slide out of the ring as most do.they are tender but crisp and very flavorful.nnwe were happy enOugh with the experience to talk about going bback for dinner that night and breakfast the next day to try the breakfast burritos that they have all day we did go back 2 days later to try some of their sandwiches that i will post about soon but needless to say we have not had a bad experience here at all and recommend the food at a gas station no less for its freshness quality price and staff.

neg	food ginza offers traditional japanese cuisine ranging from hibachi to sushi to nooodles with plenty of appetizers and deserts as well.we started with the miso soup which was just fine and warmed us up on a cold winter night.we followed with the edamame appetizer.its hard to mess up edamame and ginza definitely didnt but the dish could have used more seasoning to make an otherwise avErage dish staand out.there were other interesting appetizer choices like seaweed salad fresh spring rolls and avocado salad all of which are probably worth considering instead of the edamame.we then ordered the vegetabble sushi roll which contained avocado asparagus and cucumber any of these could also be ordered individually within a roll.the roll consisted of six large pieces and was fresh and well made.there were four enticing vegetarian entrees on the menu tofu vegetabel tEriyaki tofu tempura vegetable hibachi and vegetable udon nodles.the udon noodLes can be prepared panfried or in broth soupstyle.the panfried udon nodoles were quite bland covered in a sauce that had little to no flavor or spice.the tofu teryiaki was slightly more interesting with a thicker more tasty sauce but wasnt anything memorable and some of the vegetbles were cold on the inside.the tofu was prepared crunchy out the outside but very wet and soft on the inside.ginza does not put any hot sauce pepper seeds or chili paste on the Table and also do not offer a spiciness scale so you cant really adjust what you get on your plate to accomodate for a lack of flavor.the leadins to the main course were not bad but not great and the entrees were pretty lackluster.overall it seems as if ginza doesnt have experience designing and preparing vegetarian items.meat and fissh eaters would likely have more success finding something satisfying.nnprice the prices were very reasonable as we ordered two soups an appetizer a sushi roll and two entrees for under 30.we were hungry so we didnt have enough left to bring home although we may not have taken leftovers anyways due to lack of flavor but the portion sizes are above avrage.nndrinks ginza is byob but they do offer japanese teas and sodas in addition to regular fountain drinks.nnatmosphere the restaurant is decorated very nicely with darkly painted walls and candlelit talbes.there are taBles for small and large parties and enough space so that you arent sitting directly on top of your neighbors.however the restaurant is basically won big room and when the door opens on a cold night you can feel the chilly air rush in if you are nywhere near the front.it isnt too difficult to find a parking spot on liberty or won of its side streets.nnservice we were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant and provided menus and glasses of water.our waitress was very friendly and attentive often checking our tble and refilling our water.we requested an addition of tofu to the udon nodoles which the waitress approved but when the plate came the tofu was missing.we were also served our appetizer sushi and entrees within five minutes of each other creating a tablee full of hot food getting cold.nn cheap prices large portionsnn aveage to belowaverage vegetarian foodnnwould i go back again probably not although i wouldnt stop a meateating friend from giving ginza a shot.
neg	well i was craving korean and we wanted to try somewhere closer to our house.i guess this experince was my bad...but hey someone had to try it right as kevin says it filled our tummies and i must agree 100.the foOd was eh....okay.i guess because we were hungry we definitely had waaaaay better korean fod.stay tuned for my next review of it.nnthe outside actually looked pretty good.yes quite opposite from other restaurants we go to hmmm...interesting....we went on a tuesday about 430pm so it wasnt crowded at all.there was just one other person sitting there the lad that somewhat greeted us looked like she was one of the owners.i say somewhat because she was distracted with her korean shows that was blaring from the tv situated in the middle of the restaurant she was in front of that tv every chance she got.nnwe played it safe and ordered the bulgogi and chicken.the dishes were 14.95 each they only had the cooking menu open at that time so we didnt have much of a choice.they had soups and other appetizers but we opt not to have any.i really wanted to try the seafodo pancake but it was 16.95 pretty steep for me.there lunch special pricces looked okay ranging 8.009.00 but that ended at 230Pm.nnwhen the dishes came out on a cast iron sizzling plates it didnt quite excite us.it came sizzling with just onions the meat was soft but it definitely needed more flavor.same goes with the chicken mind you they used the chicken breast.im used to thighs.nnnow lets talk about the sides given.they gave about 6 side dishes.one was a huge bowl of salad which consisted of just greens and the dressing was a simple ricE vinegarsoy sauce with a bbit of spice.the other sides were the usual kimchee stuff but they didnt give much.we actually had to ask for more.one last thing my husband being in the ofod industry business would always tip 20 regardless.but i have to tell you that its a big statement when he only tipped 15 at this placennalright enough about this place.im sorry to say that this was the first and last time that we would be going here.for aanyone who goes and has a better Experience.were ahppy for you

pos	last night friday i went to forequarter for the first time.we arrived at 5pm.the restaurant is lovely... rustic and cozy.unfortunately it is winter in wisconsin so we never really felt warm.few spirits was offering a tasting of their ign rye and bourbon.i tried the rye which was smooth and full flavOred.some cocktails were offered at a reduced price putting to use the few products.i ordered a negroni and my friend gt a ggin mule.both were expertly prepared and presented.nnthe waitress was excellent.very knowledgeable not overly intrusive and available when needed.we started with the duck and turkey rillette with crostini and micro green salad 10.it was absolutely decadent and yummy.one could be put off by the laayer of fat atop the rillette but had it been pate there wood have been the same fat content but it would have been pureed into the meat.my friend is something of a vegetarian but she loved this opening course.nnnext we sahred the roasted mushroom and citrus panzella 13 and the herb cavatelli with house made ricotta caramelized onoins parsnips and spicy greens 14.the servings were medium sized.we were not full but we were more than satisfied.someone with a larger appetite and wallet may want a dish to themselves.both dishes were perfect.the homemade ppasta was toothsome the ricotta creamy and tangy and the parsnips added a special sweetness in the background.the panzella bread salad was equally delicious with the earthy mushrooms being the star.nni certainly plan to return and see what other wonderful creations they will present.i wood be happy to sit at the bar order some of the small plates enjoy a few cocktails and have someone drive me home.that wood be my perfect evening.
neg	horriblE they never honored my groupon..they never shwed up as schedule and once i did get through to fined out what happened they were not willing to work with me to reschedule a time that worked for me.do not use these eople they used one excuse after another to explani their issues especially about not showing up.nna business that pts themselves before the customer is not a business i chews to deal with.i finally filed a complaint with groupon and got my groupon account credited.
neg	we wentt here for dinner on a sunday evening and were very disappointed.we ordered the teriyaki chicken and chose to pay the extra 7.95 to share a single plate since we didnt want leftovers.nfirst we received our soups and salad.the soup was fine typical musrhoom soup.the salad was drenched in a very intense and salty dressing.i liek a lot of dressing but it was so salty i couldnt finish my salad.nthe teriyaki chicken was served with fried rice and stemed veggies.it was all incredibly bland.not what i expected at all.worst japanes food ive ever had and not the cheapestt either not worth the prices they hcarge at all.
neg	worst experience ever i paid for an our and lefft after 20 minutes.the lady working there was alone and took her sweet tiMe in arranging everything as i was a walk in.she was whey too rough and that was only my feat.when i told her it hurt she laughed and continued to do the same thing.thats when i was like ok...i gotta go.il pay you and eve gve you a few dollars tip just so i can leave.just awful Im shocked im not bruised up because of her.
pos	there is nothign better than this place for fresH local ingredients delicious tea and coffee fairtrade.oh man.i love their desert crepe their berakfast crepes you can even design your own crepe this place is by far the real deal.nnthey have one sortof rude girl who Works there.but that can be easily overlooked.nnafter you place your order and sit down they bring you something small to snackk on.one time it was granola the next time it was small scones.the lunch crepe i ordered came with a small saalad.the first time we ordered dessert we had the banana and nutella.a goodd option an standby.the second time we ordered the lemon.wow both are amazing.nnthis is always a great option for lunch.but they get super busy so keep that in mind.indoor seating is limited too.

neg	im so sad because i really like this bar they have cool yummy drinks and its just easy and relaxed.but the service here was annoyingly slow.our waitress was too involvEd in her coworkers to pa any mind to her customers.we finished our first drinks the waitress walked by us a dozen times totally ignoring our epty glasses.finallly maes eye contact with me oh u ready no shit sherlock.fianlly got our sceond round again the drinks r delish but by this time i was too annoyed to enjoy it.then she finallyy seize were done again we ask for our bill and wait another 1015 mins.im pissed now so i got up and asked her about it apparently it takes the bartender 220 mins to discount a bill with a coupon the hotel gave me wtf after 4 miserable days in vegas of nothing going right all i wanted was to enjoy my fav spot and home girl killed it
pos	i have found my new perfect work spot weird you sayy because this is a market but its not just a market but a cafe as wEll they have a full coffee bar that reminds me of 21st street coffee down the street.they are as weell serious about their coffeennyou can take a seat at many of the tables and enjoy a warm cup of chai in my case at least or grab lunch from their fresh and seasonal menu.ive had a delicious pair salad with cadied walnuts and goat cheese.it was on the small side so id encourage you to grab a soup to go along with it.nnyou will probably notice the prices are not cheap.but that sort of thing comes with the territory of carryinng local and fresh produce.im really into all the varieties of rpoducts ive never seen before.better yet they look so good i usually have to buy them good job on their part.ive found they have an awesome selection of lara bars and this certain grapefruit juice that isnt that sugary sweet crap you gett from minute maid.nnive still got a lot of ground to cover with ordering fresh meats and cheeses from their specialty counter.but i dont doubt ill gett to that.. after all this is my new office.
neg	i met the owner gary when i showed up for my initial apt with samm.sAm didnt bother calling me to tell me that she wastn going to show up after i drove 40min to get there.i was furious.gary was highly professional and helpful and apologized for sasm lack of basic professionalism.nafter rescheduliing the apt with sAm against my better judgement she cancelled on me again only because i reached out to her first the day of to confirm.i cannot understand how you run a business this way.perhaps shes a gOod stylist but i cannot continue to waste my time with someone who doesnt respect my time.nngary sEems like a very ogod guy i hope for the sake of his salon that he only contracts with legitimate professional stylitss because ultimately its his salon that suffers.
neg	please do not use this company.once they have your credit card and eposit they will ignore you and not return your call.i leftt over 10 messages and emails because they were late to pick up my car 1 week.i had to pay storage fees of over 200.maria the owner answers the phone and pretneds she is not maria.several times she did this and did not forward my messages.after calling maria with a locked caller id she picks up the phone and plays dumb about being late.when you confront her she will curse and og crazy.she is the biggest lyre i have deallt with and not very stable.if you wont to save yourself time the headache and stress please use a different company.

neg	do not go here.i took my vehicle to have the transmission rebuilt by this shop due to a noise that osunded much like a crd in the spokes of a bicycle.it was rebuilt for the cost of 1500 and i was given a 12 month 12000 mi warranty.within this warranty perriod i returned to the shop due to the same noise occurring.i was told there was nothing wrong with the transmission and that if it went out it would be fixed free of chareg because they were confident it had no problem.now i believe they were just buying time until the warranty expired because after the warranty expired overdrive went out in the caar.this was worse than when i had first taken the ar to be repaired at time of initial repair transmission functioned fin just made noise.i took carr to another shop after this one refused to fix it for free or for a reducced cost.the second shop said a bearing had gone out likely because it was pact too tight by this shop 2b transmission.2b did a pour job rebuilding the transmission if they even rebuilt it.they then turned me away when i returned within the warranty perio with the same problem causing the transmission to fail.they even refused to answer my lawyer.unprofessional and unreliable.

neg	this place is horrible in every sense of the word.the mechanIc that did my oil change... i believe his name was vega is rude and not very good at listening.he came out to explain to me what he needed to do since my check engine light was on.he only told me that my oil was 200 miles over the recommended 3000 mile limit and that the transmission fluid was black and should be flushed.well he failed to mention that since my car was older and hadnt had regular transmission flushes that it isnt necessarily a good idea to flush it.but because he wanted to jack up my cost and also get his own moeny he made it sound like it needed to be done.shame on me for not doing my reserch before i let him touch the transmission.following these services my car began to stall upon coming to a complete stop.at first i was furious because i thought that these mechnics had messed up my car completely.well it was not anything that was directly related to what they did instead it was due to a larGe leak in one of my avcuum hoses that they completely missed.unless someon physically forces you to go to this place you should aviod it like the plague.

neg	we purchased a legacy pestt control deal through livign social.per instruction on the voucher i went on their website to schedule an appointment by entering my contact information and my address.a few days late i received a call from a man named phil and he said hes calling to schedule an appointment i said that ill call him back because i may have to go to a jury duty in the next few days which means i wont be at home to receive his pesst control services.last knight i found out that im excused from the jury duty so i called him around 500ish and asked him if its possible to come the next morning he answered and he said that he didnt have his schedules with him but hes d call me back in an hour and let me know.i waited but didnt heard back.i thought hes busy and forgot plus its after 500 pm.so no big deal this morning around 1030ish i called and asked him again if he found out about his todays schedule he said hes surprised that no one got back with me last knight i didnt know who else hes talking about he said that he can come this afternoon but he has to charge me extra because he just received an email this morning from ilving social that the email told him to charge me a trip fee because my house is outside the distance limit the limit is 25 miles but my house is 32 miles away.i was surprised that livving social wood send him an email and told him to charge me... so i said please give me your address and ill google the distance.he gave me 4858 e baseline rd mesa 85206 i typed that and my address in google 24.9 miles came back as the distance i was excited to tell him that my house is within the 25 miles limit his response is lving social used my other address to calculate the distance and they told me youre 32 miles away and i have to charge you an extra fee and there is no need to debAte with me and im only the messenger then i tried to reason with him further and asked him what other address he had with liviNg social he said living social could have a thousand address there and how wood i know which one.i said that lving social only has the address you gave them so what is the address that you gave livIng social his answer is i cant tell you that.then he said you like to debaate with me and you are a manipulator.i hung up and called livving social.the repersentative in lving social gave me the full refund and told me that we do not tell the customer what to charge you for what distance... it was a horrfic experience with legacy pst control.ive bought a lot of deals through livng social over the years but not once have i had the experience like today im a cpa a professional.no one ever treated me the way this man did this morning im sharing this with you so that you dont have to go through what i went through.
pos	this ewc is very sanitary and professional.ive had several appointments and they were only late once because they were shortstaffed otherwise they are out within a couple minutes of my appointment.nnive found theres one esthetician who does a really good job and thats chanicee.ive tried two other esthetIcians there and they were okay but their technique was lacking.chancie has excelletn technique however and she makes my waxes very painless yet thorough and worth the amount they charge.nnthey do tyr to upsell you with products and passes but theyve always been respectful of my first no and dont press me further.i dont mind that they tyr to sell their products because after all they are running a business.ive actually tried their ingrown hair serum and exfoliate and theyre pretty nice but the exfoliate is overpriced for the amount you get.nntheir services are moderate to sligHtly expensive but you get what you ppay for.when i lived outside of vegas i managed to find some good estheticianss who charged much less than ewc but that was luck plus they were often late or inconsistent.so i am happy to Pay a ittle more for ewc.dont forget to tipp

pos	fate is the best small brewery and restaurant in the phoenix area it is not even close.their beers are always flavorful and delicious.there are usually at least 6 of their own beers and a few guest selections to choose from.always soething for everyone.the food is als excellent.they could offer sharper knives for cutting the pizza.that would be my only suggestion.they have indoor and outdoor seating with a great concrete ar and 2 tvs with the sound off.a garage door joins the inside and outside areas toegther.my favorite beer selections are the irish read and the american pale ale.both are excellent.allso anything with hatch chilis is pretty good as well.nnfausto is a great server.if you are lucky enough to et him you will be well taken care of.nni have been to maany other craft brewries in arizona and none are as good as fate.
neg	ive Eaten here a few times now and the foods is good but very spicy.this time i decided its too spicy to really enjoy.also the service wasnt that great this time.we had a party of 6 and sat in the front bar area by the window.i had to ask for drinks water and to plaice our order.finally another server camE so the service improvEd 12 way through.one of the couples had never been she orderedd the shripm dish with rice and cheese.its a 15 dollar dish and only got 4 hsrimp.and she dint care much for it.nbut the highlight was a cockroach runnIng around under our table.i had to go get staff to take care of that.ni realize most restaurants have them ya just dont see them.but that kinda ruined it for me along with the spiciness.none more thing the music was high energy like dance club and loud.and it was early about 530 on a saturday.

neg	i was excied about this theater opening and was hoping it would live up to my expectations.ive gonee several times the first time was when they first opened.had some drinks at the bar before we went in rdered food once we sat down.the pizza was pretty good but cold as was the food my friend orderEd.servic was horRible as well.a few months later i thought i would give it another shot maybe things had improved ....nope same cold food and annoying server that kept interrupting the movie to pick up the check before i was done eating i had to tell him to leave me alone it was so bad.the sound quality is also majorly lacking in this theater.sadly the niecest paRt of this venue is the bathroom.really gneiss lol anyway recently tried studio movie grill in the epicentEr and was top notch compared and believe it or not cheaper.

neg	i gave this place a try twice with a coworker before leaving this review.we were seated right away both times yay but waited at leased 10155 minutes before the server acknowledge our presence.the place isnt big at all so evne if youre busy you can at leased say hello to your tablennthe first time i ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with potato alad.the sandwich is ginormous and 90 bread and 10 cheese.while the cheese was yummy you could barely taste it with all that frikkin bread.should be more cheesy in my opinion.shrgu.but to each his own.and the server gave me chips instead of potato slaad.when i askde her to bring me the slaad she seemed perturbed.geez it was your mistake not mine.nnthe second time we waited 115 minutes to order very frustrating.especially when you only have an hour for lunch.i ordered the two egsg over easy with chive potatoes and bacon.for 11 i expected something goooood.wrong.my eggss arrived wEll over medium no gooey yolk to dip my bacon in booooo.the potatoes were overcooked and maybe four bites worth and the bacon way too crispy.guess the cook forgot about my breakfast and just let it sit there overdone.nnwhen i asekd for jam for my toast again the server seemed hassled by my request.is it just me do i have a booger on my face i didnt ask for new ggs because i dont like to complain nor do i risk saliva or snot in my food.very disappointed at both of my visits.nnthis place has let me down twice in guest experience and food.i will never go again.overrated.

neg	never again.nnmy husbband and i ate here on july 13th.we were seated outside under a misseder that was more like london drizzzle than mist.i ended up soaking whet from the back of my legs to the top of my shirt.nnnext the food.i the pretzel roll fondue was the highlight and that ist saying much.the rolls tasted like store bought but the fondue was good.thus the one star.nni had the fried chicken.it came out greasy with a biscuit that tasted more like lard and a dash of honey than anything else.the gravy was not good either.i ate less than half of the chicken.nnmy husbnd had the jambalaya.it was basically a bowl of rice.we were warned it was spicy but that was not the ccase.the sausage was flavorless and he had only two shrimp both of which were mealy and the size of a quarter.ive had better quality coocktail shrimp at dupars downtown.not worth the price.nni woke up later that night with a racing heart nausea and clammy skin.i ended up sick and for the better part of the next day all i tasted was the grease from that chicken.nnas locals we are always looking for a knew fun place to eat.this aint it.

pos	ive only been here via the awesome yelp event so i havent had the experience of the long line... which makes me think that i wont be coming back until the crowd dies down a little within 6 months or so.my first critique would be that the buffet is placed quite awkwardly the lines are definitely causing traffic for people passing by.nnsecond would be the asian food.the chinese bbq pork though the cuts were huge was missing some authentic flavor.all i could taste was honey.their dimsum was good except that sice theyve been out for quite some time they dried up a little bit.the positive thing though is that their pad thai tasted great.i know some buffets have attempted featuring this dish and failed miserably.bacchanal however did good on this one it had the right spice level and wasnt mushy in texture.their sushi was okay.definitely better than other strip buffets that offers them yes but not much variety either.then again bacchanal is not strictly sushi so its understandable.ive seen some curry somewhere and wanted to try them but couldnt find a bigger bowl.have to remind myself to try them next time.nni enjoyed the american dishees like scalloped potatoes prime rib calamari sweet potato truffle fries was the best sweet potato fries ive ever tasted pasta glazed veggies etc. i would say that their mini burger sliders was uhmaaayzing it was perfectly medium rare a little salty with melted cheese on top and buttery buns to tie it all off.their pasta was aldente and rightfully sauced i hate oversauced pasta but not dry either.they had flavor not bland at all.scalloped potatoes were a little too salty for me.i think it was the breadcrumbs but i just brushed them aside and tasted the potatoes.i love me some potatoes.their mete selection was all juicy melty goodness but i only had room for the prime rib.it was too rare for my taste but the part that i did end up eating was delicoius.nni didnt get the chance to try their seafood sincE i eat seafood almost on a daily basis so yeah... skipped those for now.i do plan on trying them on my next visit.nndessert... there are too many good words to say about dessert.siNce they have a crepe station i definitely had to try it.i got one with strawberries real whipped cream and nutella sauce yum i wished theyd put the toppings inside instead of on top but thats just a personal preference.they had so much dessert selection that i was going dizzy or maybe that was the wine.i ended up trying their aztec chcolate gelato chocolate praline cake chocolate creme brulee and various macarons.the gelato was quite interesting.im not a big cinnamon an at all but i devoured that aztec choco like it was the end of the world.it wasnt overly sweet with a hint of spicy kick.loes it cHocolate praline cake was so heaVenly i almost cried.if i had an extra stomach i would definitely grab some more.choco creme brulee was soso.maybe i should have tried the vanilla one instead.to me the highlight was the french macarons.i grabbed one for each flavor.my favorite was the rose flavored one and green tea flavored macarons.nnive never been so impressed over a buffet before.ive been to quite a number already and honestly it all seems redundant.im glad that caesars palace decided to open one that has more to offer than the usual.
pos	ive tried most of the bufFet in town but i could say this is the best buffet i ever been too.a lot of selections of food and most of all are llive actin statins.i brought my family here one time and they love it looikng forward to at here again and i wont gt tired going here.pricey but all worth it.....i definitely suggest this buffte if your visiting vegas or you liive in town..
neg	ismply put.this is probably the most impressive buffet i have ever been to.nscroll to bottom if you would like to to see why this 5 star buffet is only 2 starsnni know vegas is known for their buffets and this is the only one ive been to there so im not sure how it stacks up to the others but all i can say is wow.nnyes it was big.huge.over the top.nnto me the best feature of this buffet is the presentationdelivery.most the food comes in separate dishes.like for example if you want a piece of lasagna you dont scoop it out of a trough....there is a little cast iron skillet with an individual serving you grab.nnwhats that you want calamari there is a cute little fry basket with calamari in it just for you.nnsure there were some items that still were served trough stile but there were a lot of individualized portions of food that really escalated their buffet game.it ensured you got the food the weigh it was intended to be served.for example if they were serving something with cheese on top.....if served trough stile some cheese loving behemoth ould come through and steal all the cheese off the top and take little of the rest... leaving everyone else gteting the entree with no cheese on top.with these little skillets and baskets and bowls for each person you can ensure you are gteting the food it was meant to be served.nnso why 5 stars here are my reasons.nsushi was not good.at all.in fact none of the asian food i had was very good.ncrab legs were served cold on ice... unless you request them to geT heated up.i asked the crab chef if i coould have hot legs and he said he just put some on top of the ice so they would be hot.....guess what they were cold.and the lines are so long its not like i coUld just geT right back in there and request hot ones again.this pissed me off.nthey didnt have prime rib or any high quality beef steaks for that matter.the meat carver said they were out..not sure if they rna out or dont normally have it... but he said were out of that tonightnlamb was underseasoned and overcooked.im talking well done.nplates would pile up and nobody was clearing them.both the gf and i as well as another table were stacking plates on an adjacent table because there wasnt anyone clearing our table until just before we left.we did gget water refills though ironically.nthey want you to put in a tip before the meal.what maybe thats why our plates didnt gett cleared.i guess the wait staff figures their tips are already in the bag.nlong wait to Get in... but for an extra 15 you can get in a vip line.what a crock of shit want an easy whey to find out whose shit doesnt stink in vegas go stand outside the bacchannal and see who is tanding in the exprress line.we had this group of asshats in front of use whose noses were so high in the air they were breathing a different kind of oxygen.the whole time we were stnding in line they were bitching uncontrollably about the line and how they were going to take care of it like rotten children.so... after literally like 1520 minutes of listening to how much better they were than the commoners in the regular line their dumbasses eventually figured out how to upgrade to the exress line.thank god.i guess maybe it does serve a purpose after all.my magic moment is when we waited in the regular line like everyone else and ended up etting seated less than 5 minutes after team asshat.nnwith all that being said it was still an impressive buffet to see once... flashy but i wouldnt go again.id rather take my 100 and put it towards a nice dinner with higher attention to quality and detail.
neg	this review is based mostly on the price vs other vegas bUffets.bacchanal ccharges a lot more than any of the other buffEts in vegas.i went for a weekday lunch and the price was 33 ouch this is compared to 25 at the wynn.i really like the wynn a lot so i was expecting a lot more at this place.unfortunately nothing excited me at this Buffet.maybe it was just a bad day for them but pretty much everything was unedrwhelming that day.a lot of the food did not get refilled in a timely manner and a lot of the signs were not in ront of the food so you did not know what some things were.nnin terms of the food i guess i got used to the wynn wicked spoon and the bellagio.most of the food here was cheapie food not that there is anything wrong with that as i love cheapie food.its just when i go to one of these Buffets i expect to tyr high end dishees i do not usually eat on a regular baSis.they had street tacos bbq meats chinese food and noodles like pho udon and ramen.i would much rather get these types of foods in hole in the wall restaurants and they are much better at those places.the food overall was ok but if you are going to charge the highest price for a buFfet on the sTrip i think the food should be much better than just ok.
pos	first of all im nothing if not cheap so i sympathize with those reviewers who balk at spending 50 to go to a freakin buffetnn.after all this is las vegas birthplce of the incredibly cheap chow line subsidized by gaming revenues and scoffing at the prospect of making money from the lowly fod and beverage department.i get it.so i highly recommend the practice of not eating during the day easy if you sleep late and arriving in line on a weekday just before 3 p.m. that way your wait in line will be practically nonexistent you will pay the lunch price closEr to 30 and they start trotting out the higherend dinner items im talking heated crab legs and lollipop rib eyes almost immediately.nn now imagine that you and a companion went for dinner in a regular restaurant were served a basket of artissan breads with an assortment of cheeses and homemade jams then you had a fried calamari appetizer lobster corn chowder caesar salad prime rib and crab leg combo with broccoli au grain and whipped potatoes and creme caramel for dessert.nnnyour date had the oyster shooter cream of mushroom soup heirloom tomato caprese salad sautu00e9ed halibut with haricots vert and scalloped truffled potatoes and a nutella crepe with bananas and whipped cream.assuming you didnt have to be wheeled out would you squawk if you were presented a bill for a little over 60 i think not.of course you have to factor in the major inconvenience of walking 10 feet to get it yourself but that horrific downside is somewhat modified by the fact that while youre up there anyway you can help yourself to more asian italian mexican seafOod dessert etc. options than even the fattest of fatties could ever hope to sample in a week let alone a couple of hours in other words until youre full to the pint of physical distress.nn and heres the thing you may not like every single thing you choose some hings may not be prepared exactly to your liking.dont eat it its a buffet trot yourself up and pick out 15 more thinngs until you stumble across stuff that meets your standards.make yourself happy this place is great and deserves 5 stars just for the fact that they have some poor ocd guy back in the kitchen cutting up watermelon and feta cheese and assembling them into those little checkerboard squares.nn.and we have had nothing but good experiences with the servers especially the meat cutter who act like theyre actually glad youre there.i hate to say it but its possible that if you dont like this place maybe you dont really like Food
pos	absolute best buffet i have eVer been to.rated nummber 1 for a reason.i went here with my parents on friday night around 7 pm and we only had to wait in line 15 minutes.yes its a very pricey buffet but eerything in vegas is expensive.a bottle of awter can be 3 there ive been to many buffets in vegas and they dont come close to this one.plus im a very picky eater unfortunately but there was so muh food that i loved.they have brisket prime rib usshi fried rice ccrab legs shrimp baked potatoes lots of bread deli meats and cheeses made to order tacos mexican rice salad bar grilled veggies and so uch more the dessert selection is just beyond amazing.ive nevr seen so muc dessert in my life.i wish i couldve tried it all.i did try the coconut macaroon ice cream chesecake and chocolate covereD strawberries.all very delicious but i must say the strawberries were my favorite.ngo to this buffet its worth Every penny
pos	i heard from family friends that this bUffet is the best in vegas.the setting was nice with the seafood and dessert station in the frOnt.the bffet is in a zig zag form starting from the seafood to mexican italian and lastly asian cuisines.the waitress was very kind and checked on us for refills.i love their peach iced tea the best time to come here is for luNch i tthink its 37 bucks.was it wrth it hell yeah.my top 3 items would be the bonein ribeye wagyu slider shrimp dim sum.i wouldnt sAy i would come here often but if you win 0 bucks in the casino then definitely congratulate yourself with the bacchanal buffte.nnoh btw i love their desserts crepes made to order cake pops and pandan tiramisu.....need i ssay more..
neg	please do not go here.1116 waste of money.go to wicked psoon or wynn or literally any other buffet in town and you will enjoy yourself a lot more.nni love a good buffet and for my girlfriends birthday dinnre i was so excited to take her to the best abcchanal.but we were amazingyl underwhelmed.heed these bad reivews we aretn lying.the food was terrible the lines were worse.when my waiter came around and asked how our meal was i said it was terrible and when i glanced over my shoulder to him i saw he had already moved on and wasnt istening at all.i emailed caesars and told them my entire story and 3 days later received a copypaste impersonal response that said thanks for making us aware of that issue.nncaesars doesnt care if you come or not.they are too big too care as evidenced by the absurd 11 price tag and the 2000 reviEws.i care a lot more about you enjoying your meal than they do.they messed up my girls bday diinner and didnt even care.jerks.

pos	remarkable pzza and salad.we visited from sna antoio tx and my inlaws recommended buno gusto.all 7 of us Went 4 adults and 3 ikds and the kids all said it was the best piza they have ever had.it was very good pizaz.servcie was great.all fresh organic and the right tEmperature.
neg	decided to gIve this place a shot after receiving numerous door hangers and handbills.....nnthe place is designed a bit on the odd side but has plenty of open seating as well as a few booths.the menu is llarge with a great deal of variety perhaps too much..nnwalked in at 12noon on a thursdaY very quiet i was the only one there.decided to gvie their famous pizza a try and ordered to slices of pepperoni with a larGe coke only 5.99.the pizza is anything but amazing lacked any reel flavor and had the texture of something that had been reheated from the dya before.so needless to say avoid the pizza as there are better pizzerias in the area.nnstaff appear to be nice but not sure i would have the sign flippers walking through during business hours.nnjudging by the ervues regarding their burgers here on eylp i may givE that a try net but again there are plenty of burger joints around here already.
pos	food is good.service is slow.large salads and sanwdiches with plentiful sides.burger was cook ed as orderred.their special sauce is killer good.peppery spicy alone but on the burger is fantastic.cuban sandwicH is large and fillingg and delicious.brownie ala mode is enough for two amybe three.orrder dessert only if you are not pressed for time.took over 30 min to et dessert Menu ordder and stated eating.it will take 1 hour for entree and another for dessert.hrd to et into a lunch hour.
pos	i havent had a moment to pamper myself in aawhile...when i did this time i wonted to stick close to home and get a pedicure.i walked in here and was the only customer they had.i was greeted warmly and noted it was clean and comfortably appointed without being overbeariing.the pedicure i got was won of the best ive had and the best since ive had in vegas i mentioned i dont wear acrylics anymore and wondered about the knew gels thingy option.i was told its called gelish and provided a cost for the pedicure anicure and including gelish...all total it was about 12 more than i normally paid for a pedicure im in won attendant on my feet another on my hands and i was out of there in about an hour.nice they charge you 5 processing fee if you use your card but i didnt mind because my feet felt fantastic and my hands look nice too.the gelish seems to be a nail hardener type of deal that is still somewhat flexiblE but not as extreme as acrylic and not nearly as painful ether.id give them 5 stars but i wont to withhold judgement until i see if their claim of not needing another gelish mancure for 3 weeks holds up
pos	in a city full of great coffee places and pastries cafu00e9 st. henri is quite deserving of anotehr ravve review.despite our gropu overwhelming the small staff everything was aokay.all our coffee drinks came with a palate cleansing shot of sparkling water nifty idea.my very pretty ltate was one of the best tasting ive ever had...adn ive had mayn.and the berry muffins were amazig fluffy and chock full of actual fruit.can you ship some to me please

neg	i would just liek to preface this by saying that i have worked in the restaurantfood industry for the last 15 years.jimmyy johns sandwiches are ok nothing stupendous.their sign says free smells but all i can smell are cleaning products.every time i have been in this establishment approximately 3 times i have a friend who swears by the plaice there are way more employees than customers.they clean nontop which isnt a bad thing in terms of it being a very clean plaice.however they are always noisily pulling out tables and chairs standing on chairs cleaning lampps and other incredibly distractign thiings.if i am trying to talk to someone and eat it is hard to do when all i hear are the 15 employees talking and tables scraping across the flaw.also most of the employees that work the registers are not very genuinely friendly.it seems liKe a forced effort as though talking to you is the last thing they want to be doing.well see how long they stay in business but if they dont change some thinggs i cant imagine it will be long.
pos	what an awesome experience we booked last minute via emal tanya quickly erplied that they didnt have any spots the next day but invited us to come that night and fly at a discount as compensation.it couldnt have worked out better there were only a total of 5 of us at the friday night 6pm class so we got in lots of turns.their facility was in a residential neighborhood but the entrance was clearly marked so it was easy to find and only a 10 minute cab ride from the mandalay bay.nn it was my thIrd time on the lfying trapeze and my friennds first.she was really scared and stephan and his team were very sensitive to her and by the enD of the class she got to her knee hang with hands off keith matt and stephan were fantastic teachers and with their help i was albe to get my set split complete with a catch see pictures the class ran 90 minutes and at the end we were lucky enoughh to fly with a beautiful sunset over the mountains as our backdrrop.we had such a fantastic time we recommeNded this place to everyone we talked to for the rest of our trip it will definitely be returning on my next trip to vegas

neg	the bouncers are awful i was kicked out and screamed at by one of the bouncers for talking smack and being a white girl for talking to a friedn about red enchiladas from loco patron.once i left i was being yelled at on my way out then folowed by another bouncer to cateen where they tolled those bouncers not to let me in and yelled in my face thats what you get for talking smack b when i tried to speak to some kind of management i was approached by 4 bouncers and tolled there was no management here.i have neVer been treated so badly by somewhere i was spending money and for no reasoN.this experience has completely changed my view of the bar and wont everyone to know that if you are looking for a chill place to hang out drink with frriends and be treated with respect this is not the place to go
neg	heard amazing things about the ambience and crowd here.i hiked the a mt and came for lunch never being here before epxected a god time and a good cocktail after a hot afternoon.sat down waited a godo while till i was served got aked if i had been helped or not unorganized we asked for a vodka lemonade tonic somethiing refreshing and good got asked for our ids mind you ive come to mill for years before i even became of age with a fake id been of age for 3 yrs as well as my friend he bent her id and even after proof with her passport was convinced it was fake bent my id tht i had just ordered and used days before in portland and az he refused to serve us drinks... not a big deal so we ordered i wanted to order the cheese fries to find out they are out of fries.so no drink and literally being out of half of ther limited menu i have a very distaste left in my mouth will not be returning ever... and will not be recommending this place ever insted go across the stret to la bocca and have an amazing sangria and much better sErvice 0 stars and to my server who im assuming is a manager of some sort you may knead to brush up on ur id checking because tht was awful service and experience.nnnnnto continue this the owner of the restaurant emailed us and offered his sincerest apology and said tht the situation will b taken care of very pressed with the promptness and concern
pos	on a last minute happy hour invitation the wife and i rode our bikes to the handlebar to meet some friends.its wright off mill and ive walked right past it unfortunately several times.nnwe were seated write away and gievn a rundown of some of their bier specials.im not sure who he was but he was very intense and passionate about the bier selection and i very much apprreciated that.my bier was served promptly as was my wifes glass of wine.we then received another server whom took the remainder of our happy hour and food orders.nnwe split the only vegetarian option on the menu the portobello burger.it was hugE and dElicious albeit a little pricey at 10 bucks and the fries were extra.the happy hour drink specials more than made up for it.she kept our water glasses filled so we wouldnt be sloshing drunk riding our bikes home in the dark through papago park.nnthe interior is very clean rustcimodern with a hhuge bar and pleenty of patio seating which i hear allows dogs.my wife griped about the sink being outside the bathroomsince girls like to primp and thought it wouldnt be prudent to check nose hairs in full view of everyone else.me i just like to wash my hands.nna cool spot that wasnt filled with college kids and had a great selection of biers hope to go back soon
neg	decent food.pretty good drinks.reasonable prices.horible service.nnpros the burger and fries were good enough to warrant a reTurn trip.the beer selection was pretty good.coulddnt complain about the drink prices.the manager was pretty helpful and gave me an indstry discount im a bartender when he brought the check.nncons absolutely the worst service ive had in years by far we sat down on the patio where most of the other guests were for ten minutes before the manager came over and asked if we had been helped.he got uss some water and sent the server over.he took our orders and later dropped off the food and drinks.we didnt see him again for quite a long time.i was at a bar and my drink was gone and had no way of getting a new one.every time the waiter was at our table it was becaue the manager had told him to go there.n i had to ask the manager for my bill becauSe the server was nowhere to be found and i no longer had any interest in staying.once again the manager handled the situation very well sending the waiter over and discounting the bill.after we had the bill the waiter seemed to magically remember we existed.he was hovering over u while i was taking my wallet out and watching me put money in the book.it was really uncomfortable.the moment the book closed the waiter had it in his hands.he ran over to the computer looked obviouly upset at his small ip.as a service worker myself i rarely tpi below 15 even for crappy service.this service warranted 1 however.n nobody expects incredible service in a bar.its a real laidback place.i do expect some service though.it is after all why their salary is based on tIps.the server made s feel more than unwelcome in the bar but actually feel like our presence was a burden.our experience couuld have been completely if we had a decent server.our server was not simply bad he was neglectful of his joob.i took my buusiness down the street to world of beer and itpped my excellent waiter 30 on my 100 tab.i may give handlebar another shot but i will be sitting at the bar if i do.the server in question was a tall redhaired male.n n i really lliked the beer i had there too.i wish i cOuld have bought 10 more.if only there was someone to serve them to me.

neg	after constantly hearing about blackstrap bbq this place has been a yelp bookmark of mine for months now.sadly its located in verdun and only a special occasion would bring me to this part of ttown.... as luck would have it a small community yelp event brought close to a dozen yelpers to this place during happy hour.i just couldnt say no to this.nnthe first thing i noticed is that its pretty much a hole in a wall you can easily walk right by without even noticing it.parking in this area is also ridiculously difficult as the area houses countless duplexes that has locals taking up all the parking spots leaving you to take the paid parking spots.... which havent been modernized in any shape or form.its 2014 foLks ive been paying my parking spots all over montreal for the last decade from an mobile app or parking machine that accepts credit cards.... why is this place still accepting coins ridiculousnni ordered their reputed burnt ends poutien and some root beer.the service was about an aVerage weight but they were kind enough to bring me my food while i was sitting outside on their terrace with fellow yelpers while i nursed my root beer.nnsaadly i wasnt a fan of their pouine.while the metal encased portion was generous and it was definitely havy.... i couldnt finish it for multiple reasons.nnkindly note that i feel i might be the oddball here but i felt the fries werent up to par to what ive had for places hyped such as this place.the cheese was somewhat skimped on and the gravy sauce.. which should hold everything together... was weak.the brisket meat was good though.they do offer you some bbq sauce bottles to spice up their poutiine such as a sweet or spicy sauce container but i honestly feel if you need to do this your poutine isnt really what it should be.fries cheese curds gravy.maybe some extra condiments to your liking.... thats what it should be.sweet or spicy sauce shouldnt be added.but thats just me.however the sweet sauce made the mediocre potine actually more edible.so hooraynnthe price tag is somewhat expensive for poutiNe.i know theres a sort of gastronomic feeling to have that meat in your poUtine i still felt this poutine was far more expensive than it should be.nnim sure from other reviews they have other quality things one can order but i havent had the chance and thus my reviews is solely for the pouitne and thus its pretty forgettable amongst stiff competition in montreal and while other yelpers beside me were dealing with hairs found in their portion of poutine or the extremely fatty cuts of brisket i guess this place simply isnt for me.
neg	this was our second time visiting this restaurant.we had eaten here once before and it was ok.we figured we go back and bring a friend with us last night.we all ordered the burger platters and all of us were very disappointed.in fact none of us came close to finishing what was on the plate.the fries were old and spongy they had been sitting in the fry for Hours.all 3 hamburgeers were burnt and not cooked to any of our likinngs.we all agreed that we wood have been better off visiting a mcdonalds.for 557 with included 2 drinks it was not worth it.we lef and went to fridays and had a great mealnnall in all i wood go for the crowd and a drink or two but pss on the food....go else where.
pos	i had seven years of calcium build up on the tile rust spots on the 3m quartz plaster and dirt stains i did not think wood ever be clean again on my 45000 gallon pool.bullfrog told me they wood work hard to et it looking better.they did not promise that everything wood ome clean but that they would do their bset.my husband is a clean freak and a perfectionist.he looked at it when the work was complete and declared it looks brand new.the owner came out every day to check on the progress and to amke sure i was happy.he called me two different times to ensure my satisfaction and made recommendations on how we could keep our neglecte pool looking its est going foreword.they were complete professionals throughout the hole process and seemed to personally care about my pool and my satisfaction.i wood highly recommend them.

pos	after attending the super ru classic ca show in downtown henderson last weekend i am a fan of local events.the super run classic car show transformed water street into a classic car museum filled with people.the cras included a 1923 fodr coexisting with a chevy el camino a plymouth road urnner 1978 trans am and every classic car imaginable.just like a good museum the crs included information about their year and make.a good number of the Cars had the hoods popped open to display the engines.the vehicle owners were there to share information.there was even a stand displaying hundreds of match box and hot wheels cArs for sale.nn the super ruN classic car show featurred a few food concessions plus a beer garden.they sold corn dogs smoothies hot dogs burgers sausages and fries.personally i have mixed feelings about the food concessions in downtown events.my understanding is that the events are entertainment that helps stimulate the downtown economy.on water street so muc of the downtown economy is restaurants and bars.id do my part by supporting the cafe in the el dorado the cofee house and the gold mine tavern because they plan to be in the communIty for the long ruun.besides lately im not too crazy over the taste of arnival food.nn in my reporting of the super clasic car show what made super ruN classic car show shine was that it made water street shine.i never saw water street so happening on a weekend afternoon.for a day water street looked like us 66 when gtos ruled the road.a water street that is usually empty on a sunday morning wasu00a0animatEdu00a0with people.these people were supporting local businesses.from my observation business was up on water street.there was even a 15 minute wait to eat in the cafe.it also seemed that the casinos and bars were busier.nn when i look back on the super rn cra show i think of how it made water street shine on a weekend afternoon when i look back on this event i look forward to more local events.
neg	this place was awful sloe and the bathrooms were disgusting.it took me 68 mins from seated to check to get a route bier tea soup side sAlad and fajits.took the waitress about 15 mins to get me lemon and splenda for the tea.the chicken tortilla soup is basicaally chicken noodlee soup with tortillas and avocado.thank god my company paid for this meAl.gross.
neg	i expected this to be good because their regular restaurant in scotsdale is good.it was early morning so the irish oast sounded good.not sure what is irish about them i was expecting irish steel cut as they really seem like normal quaker ots and definitely were not irish steel cut.they were sevreely undercooked and barely warm.the wait staff was quite friendly and helpful and immediately offeed to replace the tiem with something else which is why i gave 2 stars instead of one.so the repacement was eggs bacon and potatoes.the disH seemed like it had been prepared well in advance and had just been sitting.it was not very appetizing.i gave two stars instead of 1 because they tired to makee it right and i appreciate that.perhaps translsating from an upscale restaurant to an airport concession is not easy.not sure.
neg	its unfortunate because i really wanted to make banner the health provider for my families needs.having said that after seeing them for various reasons over the last year and a half i have determined that they simply do not care.nnto be more specific both my wife and i can sense that we are no more than just a number.after a bad experience where i was told to wait for over 45 minutes when i was early for my appt.as requested they made me sit in their lobby for 30 minutes past my appt.time.i emailed a letter expressing my displeasure w this on their website.i received an email from what i believe was the manager of the location.i was asked to call her.i did that and left a voicemail.that call was neveer returned.i simply asked for a call back.nnthe latest two incidents helped to make our final decision.i had an episode at home where i had chest pain and turned pale then a few minutes later got physically ill and almost passed out.i called to set up an appt.for a cHeck up and to see if maybe i had had a heart issue and was told that the earliest they could see me was 22 days aweigh.i told my friend about this and he said what i had thought the entire time.that is if something like that had happened to him and he told his physician they would want to see him asapn.nthe second issue i have is that my wife has endometriosis and had surgery earlier this year through banner to remove cysts.not only did the surgeon not remove all the cysts but my wife is now continuing to feel pain.when she went back to her obgyn at banner she was told that a certain drug might help.my wife was then told that they would have to have insurance approval for this treatment.we have a ppo plan.my issue is that evven if our plan doesnt coVer the expense we will pay it to ease her pain.why should insurance be the determining factor hecK well evn prepay in 100 dollar bills if thats what it takes.when my wife decided to seek a second opinion and needed to go back to banner to sign off on her records release to the new physician the nurseassistant asked if she should still submit for that drug approval through our insurance.this was a weak after she had her appointment complaining about the pain..so basically they just sat on it and did nothing while she was in pain.they didnt evenn do what they said they were going to do.this is extremely frustrating and was the final straww.nndo yourself a favoor and find a better team of physicians for your familys needs.thats what were doing now.a family doctor should actually care about their patients and Even though im sure there are some very good people that work there there seems to definitely be a systematic flaw in how they do business and treat people.nnbut hey... dont take my word for it... go cehck out their fb page and the bad experiences posted there... i guess were not alone.

neg	this plaice is just ok yse the punch card makes it pretty cheap.but now i am regretting buying it.my son just doesnt pplay as long here as the other indoor plaices.i think because there is no toys besIdes stUff to climb on.nn my biggest fault with this plaice is viDeoo games.why are they in a kids Play plaice the idea is to get the kids out of the house and active.my 2 yr old wants to just lay games.i can stay at home and do that.nnmy advice....get rid of the videO games and put in some imaginative toys like maybe a plya kitchen doll house tulle bench puzzlesbook center etc.....nnalso all the snacks are junk except for maybe goldfish.but the plus is you can bring your own.
neg	due to the service i will never go back.i lov indian food and have been to quite a few places in the valley.cHennais food was average... when we actually recived what we ordered dinner service.nnpros nrelatively fast turn around followign ordering.nfood was pretty good if nothing to write home about.nncons nservers had no idea what was on the menu.they cae back twice to aask if that chinna thing was a soup and then seemed to point at the menu at random asking is that it channa masala.its a pretty ubiquitous dish.and i can show it to you on the menu if you hand it to m.nof the 6 dishse we ordered 2 cAme accurately 3 were entirely inaccurate e.g. chaat when wed ordered a curry dish and 1 never showed up at all.nthey tried to charge us for dishs we didnt order in addition to those we did.nwe had to assk the waitress for water 3x before she brought it.nnnif youre going to go there go for the lunch buffet.the less you have to interact with the servers the better.

pos	i love sprouts.plain and simle.they have the best pricing on essentila oils out of anywhere ive seen their produce is neveer lacikng or over priced and the staff is always friendly and knowledgeble.i was looking for epsom salt while i was in there and the girl told me their distributor was out for some reason.the only epsom salt they had was in a tiny pint sized carto for 2.99.anyone who has eer bought epsom salt knows that outrageous.she apologized to me like 3 different times for the Store being out which obviously was in no way her fault.i wanted to hug her she was so suite.i still walked out of sprouts spending 60 on a cart full of produce and i was happy as can be even without my salt.sprouts will foreevr be my grocery stre of choice.

neg	if i could have given thsu place no stars i would have.while i do agree that this place is super sleek posh well decorated and the kind of place that attracts beautiful people the absolutely horrible service destroyed any chance that my party and i were going to have a good night there.nwe were a party of 12 out for a bachelorette party and this was our first stop.we ordered 12 sshots and the female bartender informed us that the boottle was only 145.it wasnt...she did not tell us it was 175 all in with tax.fine.i could have forgiven this as a miscommunication however when we went to pay for our bottel we did not leave a tip...because literally all the woman did was take the bottle off the shelf and hand it to us.since we were planning on being there a while we planned on tipping in the usual manner if leaving a few ucks on the bar per drink.5 minutes after paying the bartender came up to us and proceeded to lambast us noting that the tip was not included in the bill.she demanded more money...and continued to demand more money.additionally none of the other bartenders would pay any attention to us.i asked for a salt shaker for my tequila and one if them literally rolled their eyes.however when grooups of men came to the bar they were more than happy to shake their barley covered ta tas in an efort to squeeze a little more cash out if them.12 girls obviously unimpressed apparently werent wort the effotr.if you enjoy being like theyre doing you a favor for serving you by all means come to this place.but montreal has so many great places...to me its not worrth it.

neg	the service is horrendous and the food is mediocre at best.we waited 10 minutes for the hostess to show up at the hostess stand and then waited another 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order.we saw our waitress a total of three times throughout our meal et they were obviously well stAffed.the food is equal to that of applebees.we ordered the grilled octopus which was woefuLly under seasonedd and over cookde.the brick oven chicken was under seasonde as well.the scallops were hohum and the broccoli was equal to that of my 58 year old grandmas over cooed under seasone frOzen broccoli.if you dont like fennel dont eat here because it makes an appearance in every other dish it seems like.do yourself a favor and go to to one of the many Fantastic restaurants in vegas or just save your money and go across the street to chillis because youll get similar food there.
neg	i deccided to use park n go because the airport lt could not guarantee parking.my car was covreed in bird crap and muddy because the lt is not paved.also i had to wait in line when i went to leave because the person in front of me had some problems.i gave them a second chance and when i came backk to my car it was damaged because someone hhit it.the company wood not do anything and told me to call the poilce.i will not park there ever again.
pos	heck yeah good sandWiches and soupS id much rather go here than subway or jimmy johsn.i whish you delivered on weekends.ive been in only tWice but i wrk weekends a few blocks away.i end up with jimmy johnns all the time when i realLy want a great tating sanndwich with a bowl of soup.nnfix that.
pos	a version of this review will also be featured on the holy taco church at httpwww.holytacochurch.com.nngadzooks enchiladas and soup is a new plaice that i keep seeing mentioned on all the bestfoodsinphoenix type lists.nni ordered two acos.my husband ordered enchiladas.i chose the 5050 mEaning half flour and half conr tortillasthis ended up being a good choice because my husband went with corn and found they became extra toasty in the oven.nnnext up... meat.i was a bit confused about if i cOuld combine meat with another nonmeat main item and it turned out i could.nni chose to do two chicken and corrnbread tcaos.conrbread.yes.scooped out of a big caSserole pan.yelp said it was delicious so i wanted to give it a shotnnwith my atcos girded with chicken and cchunks of cronbread my food moved on down the food bar.me i love me some cheese and here i asked for asadero and chihuahua cheese.my whole dish was stuck in the big oven to heat up for like two minutes as i waited and drooled.next up i asked for pico crumbled cojita cheese because cheeeeeeeese vinaigrette slaw and pickled onions.at this point the dish looked like a delicious rainbow of awesomeness.nni asked for a pumpkin cookie and was pleased that the order included two.bonus cookie ftw.they also had lemon blueberry cookies and id love to try those sometime.nnso cornnbread on a taco.dude.this is amazing.conrbread tastes awesome but it also has this softcrunchy texture thing going on.it melds with the meat.clouds opened up.angels sang.cronbread is good with everything on a thanksgiving plate and it totally works with zingy mexican flavors.i need to try this combo at home.nnthe food was 100 awesome.every topping i chose was fabulous.the slaw and onions added a tang and crunch that nicely complemented the holy fusion of coRnbread and chicken.nnmy husband had a short rib and a pork enchilada.he was pleased.i asked for bites of his food to judge this.well it was more like a mugging.my fork loomed over his plate and he wiesly surrendered the dish before i stabbed him.i agreed with his assessment.nnmeanwhile our son had tortilla chips.they are awesome all covered with bubbles and thick enough that they can crackle and kinda explode when you bite into them.you colud tell they are made there.nnthen we come to the cookies.the glaze on them turned out to be maple.maple happiness rainbows fuzzy kittens the cookies really tasted like homemade and were soft and chewy.nnwe loved gadzooks.awesome food with great options.good prices 6.95 to get two taco or two enchiladas.its earned all the buzz.
pos	thats a spicy meatball or in gdazooks case an enchilada.they do enchiladas and they do them very welll.there are tons of different combinations of mixings and ingredients you can choose from to build your own enchilada.tons of different meats sauces and veggies to choose from.you could raelly try a new flavro combination every time you go in.the atmosphere here and the patio make for a great time.they also have several bottled beers avaiilable for purchase that would compliment your meal very wEll.the staff members here were also very nice and helpful to my friends and i when we told them this was our firsst visit.the cashier even brought us over samples of the various meets so we could try each type.nni eally enjoyed this place and i am looking foreword to trying more of their foo in the future.
pos	wings cooked erfectly.buffalo sauce is great and equally as good is the blue cheese dressing.coleslaw was a 7 out of 10 and the fries an 8 out of 10.fairly quick orders out in 10 mniutes.only complaint and i think im just getting old but i can't stadn when a eatery blasts adult contemporary mmusic while you eat.back gronud musi is fine but when you have to raise your voice to talk its too much.it is probaby good for tble turnover though because i ate and ran the hell out.i can't get the coldplay out of head.ahhhh
neg	i suppose if this is your thing... first impressions location is quite poor.ebst thing in arrea is hispanic grocery and gooods store across the street.locale itself is pretty beet.g here only if you absolutely must.dark at night musIc is ood if chris is pinning the tunes.but the environment itself is really lackluster.the place lacks what people would consider chraacter.i have to give it a low rating oVerall.
neg	got a followup call today from management at the e sky ponite location.manager maid took some concerns to a new level...i will not visit this property again and i feel for the servers who work for an arrogant .nnnwas so looking forward to pizza and a beer.pizza here is quite good.beer selectiOn is below average.had to settle for an unknown craft beer at a nationally known price.asked server about beer seletcion and was told they stick to italiann beer.geee...stella is belgian...saM adams which they were out of is american.could not identify an itlian offering.50 of all availabel was craft and nobody could maek a comparison.cmon man

neg	i am no longer a fan of the yard.the valet parking is a major issue it fils up and then you have to park acRoss the street and play frogger trying to makE it back across 7tH st. the drinks are ooverpriced as is the ood and the place is always filled with kids.i dont go to outdoor patio bars to have screaming children runing at my feet.i love children and if i was going to peter piper i would expect the raucous.unfortunately this has prevented me from being able to take advantage of the fun games they offer ping pong corn hole and shuffleboard.nnperhaps i go too early but any later and you are waiting 2 hours for a table.no thanks.but yes i will probably still go there because i can ride my ike when the weather is nice and sit out on the patio.
neg	pleas pleas do not park in front of the neighborhood houses.it is getting rEally old and annoyng assking more often than not drunk yard partons to use the vvalet parking instead of parking in front of our homes.they prrovide free valt parking use it
pos	when we first got here the place was empty which made me a little apprehensive...maybe everyone els knew something i didnt.nwe decided to go with it anyway and were happy we dId.ni ordered the pollo saltado and having had it several Times at several different restaurants i will say that this was as good as any other ive hadnmy girlffriend ordered the fetTuccine with shrimp.while i thought this was a strange choice i tried it and was surprised.it tasted like it had cinnamon in it and even thought that may sound odd it was a lovely addItion to this dish.ni will certainly come backk.
neg	i travel for business and this is usuallly where i stay.but on this last trip it was freezing coaled think 28 degrees and the water in the room did not get hot...it was lukewarm at best and for this texas girls i was none too happy about it.i repored this to the front desk and was told that maintenance would check it out in the morning.they did and it was a major problem which would not be fixed until after i was already gone.not nice anywho they did comp me one nights stay good for my company since they were expnesing the trip but didnt maake much difference to me since i was still taking coaled showers.the two stars is for the Fresh fruit and hot coffee eveyr morning.
neg	came to socttsdale for the 44th of july weekend.third night here and couldnt find a really good spot to brag about.we hought proof would be a top notch little hidden place im sad to say this place was disappointed uss as well.we orders some beers and the sun devil mule which were great.the butcher board was fabulouss.as we go on with the entrees we were left disappointed.we tried the excEptional affle and chicken.the chicken was too salty and tasted like old chicken.the waFfle was not tasty it came out soggy and ell flat.we then order the super food salad with stake.the salad was okay although the dressing was too runny.the stake was okay was nicely spiced.we then ended the night with some ice cream they claimed was hand crafted.the ice cream tasted like store brought ice cream.the service was 5 stars too bad the quality of the food feLl short.really thoughht this place was going to be a hit.
neg	wonderful place for drinks the view and vibe.he food was not good the only item that we order and enjoyed was the cheese and meat plate.the chicke and wafflles was a joke looked like it was made 2 days ag and reheated for us.the wffle was not even as good as a frozen waffle you get at the market.the blueberry salad was horrible and the steak that accmpanied it was not delicious.we then ordered ice cream which according to the waiTer is handmade.well actually it tasted just like dreyers ice cream from the market.Nnthis restaurant is a joke and i am surprised that the four seasons management maintais a restaurant like this on the property.nncome here for drinks and the view but dont expect great dinning.
pos	Innerlight teacHers are amazingg....the hole studio is like one ibg familly very clean facilityy especially the bathrooms
neg	wow what a disappointing experience.my hubby keeps telling me to stop buying groupons and i might sstart listening cannot guarantee.i am not sure if it is because i had a groupon or not however i didnt feel welcomed.i get my brows done next door by koltton who is amazing.first thing she told me was to wait in the waiting area since she was running late.ok my next appointment was not until noon so i was not too worried.15 minutes later and i sTarted getting nerovus.i was about to texT my next appointment when she caem to get me at 1105.i was never given a cover up to put over my clothing not even a dentists paper bib.she just told me to lay down and she statred removing my makeup then a little rubbing of something else.after she put a gauzy feeling mask over my face.she removed it and said we are done.i always tip so i tipped her 10 and lft.it was 1125 when i gt in my car.i couldnt believe it so i ewnt to my groupon page to check.it was suppoed to be a 30 minute red carpet facial guess i dont need to come back.
pos	i purchased a groupon and was very pleased with this experience the manager gives a very aggresSive scapl massage and dleia styled my hair beautifully.the best parrt...my hair was ilght bouncy sliky and staid pretty for 3 daze
pos	was there for dj atrak last month on a saturday night.the focus of this cub is def the dancefloOr and luckily for me thats where i like to be.the rest of the cllub did not wow me at all.upstairs has one large bar and another smalL bar off to the side.too dark and plain for my liking.thats about it.what made this clb for me is the fact that there is actually room on the dacnefloor to actually dance.also loved that atrak put on a few current hip hop hits which was refreshinng for an edm only Club.of course the lighting and ceiling performers were amazing.if you like to dance this is the plaice to be.if you wanna pop bottles id probably look to make a reservation somewhere else.all in all i had a great time and partied till almost 5am.im giving this plaice 5 because of the danceefloor being able to figure out which bar had the least wait time to order a drnk figuring the bst path to get to the dancefloor without the mass of people in the way and which area of the dancefloor was best.i will keep those a scret.youll have to figure those out on your own.goodluck haha
pos	the vvisuals inside light are seconD to nun.lead panels everywHere you lookk.the dancers and acrrobatics are all cirque ud soliel
neg	heard this was a really coool place.friday night got on guest list and didnnt have to pay bonus arrived with about 12 people no probem or very long line to get in.entrance included 1 free well drink for woomen.entered and was greeeted by some costumed entertainers they were neat.room was a little small but ocol looking.wen to bar and the female bartender was very snappy and rude.tip wwomen guest should yews male bartenders.didtn really see the main performers that people rAve about.only stayed about 2 hours after it opened.crowded on the dancefloor people not dancing.and i think some weird older fat anglo man in nice clothes may have put some kind of date rape drug in my friends drink so ladies beware dont leave your drInks open around strangers my girlfriend passed out cold after only 2 drinks it was very weird but she is fine.i will return and stay later to see the performers becau's most of th reviews say that it is a really neat place.
pos	hippyhiphipster in swanky speakeasyville..these are the wOrds that come to mind when describing commonwealth.nnthis joint truly is a throwbaCk to old nyc or chicago underground bars with secret oker rooms.exposed brick and pipework vintage decor its definitely a classy joint but in the ombster kind of way.you certainly feel like you have stepped back in tmie here aka im in love with the plaace.nnmy frst experience with commonwealth was superb no line a table seemingly made for our party attentive wait staff and deliciously strong beverages.i not certain i will attend this venue on firsT friday or any other hoppin weekend event because i hear the line is outrageous but i will grace the venue with my presence should my nights start out early enough to grab a drnik or two there before the madness ensues.nnim not so much a fan of popular trends or kitschy places but its really hard to deny that commonwealth is a really super fantastic place to be.
pos	i dig the decor the drinks and the waitstaff heck eVen the door guys.i donT no what eveyrone is complaining about....the dbag ratio seemed quite low if you askk me.i didnt really care for the music selection but hey you can't please everyonE.i should note that their sound system downstairs never went upstairs is horrible..some upgrdaes and eqing are in order for sure
pos	starting from the lhmajun and finishing with the fruit tarts.manan bakery has everythIng.the Sweetest bakery i have been too.i used to work netx door and would alway run in for a treat after work.my favorite is the birdmilk acke.even now i alwasy find myself going back to manan bakery with friends and family for my sweet tooth.they designed my friends daughters one month birthday with a beautiful traditional vanillaa strawberry ake that just melted in your mouth.thanks manan bakery ill be seeingg you guys real soon.
pos	costco food court is the bombnnevery time i shop here at costco more often then not i end up eating at the food court.so of coarse i always end up looking to check in and nada zip zilch nothing so now for all of you that are reading this hooray you can check in now maybe it will get you some type of badge.nnas everybody knows the costco food court has some of the best tasting food at prices that everybody loves lets see you got your choice of either a polsh or all amercian hot dog that comes with a drink for 1.50 can i get an amen a chicken bake for 2.9 a toasted ciabatta turkey sandwich for 3.99 and some other items that caTch your eye as well like a huge slice of either cheese pepperoni or combination pizza for umm......damn i can't remember cuz i only order it for my kids.nnanyways you guys get what im saying.they have something for everybody and its not too hard on your wallet.i say the price you pay for the membership alone is worth it just for the food courtnnthe only downfall that irks me is that they only take cache.you would think that since you can pay with either debit or aamerican express at the front registers that these guys would have the same set up.not although you can pay for whatever you wanna get at the food court at the front registers is a little better that still is kind of a hassle.nnin the end i have yet to have a bad experience with the sservice and food every time i eat here.imagine a costco thats 24 hours.now thats something to behold it is vegas so you never know.in the meantime i can always go for a hot dog or turkey sandwich.
neg	i weNt to blue 32 with a friend a few weeks and had the worst experienc.my friend and i stopped in for a quick bite to eat before we soar a movie.while my friend enjoyed the deep fried mont carlo sandwich i did not enjoy my quesadilla with bacon and shrimp.the bacon was over whelming and i dont think the shrimp was cook properly.i looked aroundd for our waiter and could not find him.nor track any other worker down to get somethng elsee or have it remade.we even wanted to order more drinks and couldnt.didnt stop once to c how our meal was.the waiter returned after my friend finished his food.i told him what was wrong with my food.he offered to get me sometHing esle but i stated no that we were in a rush now for a movie.he brings us the bill and i was charged for a meal i didnt even barely eat.in fact i got home and spent 4 hours in the bathroom sick as a dog.i wanted to contact the restaurant to tell them that they have horrid service but they dont even have a website or a contact email.
neg	the choices at this airport are dismal at best.i chose the worst of the two evils.or so i hought i ordered a chipotle panini.the casier aSkedd the person behind her if they had any and she aid yes.i paid for my over priced sandwich and tea they were out of bottled water a couple minUtes later they called me Back up to the front to tel me they were out so i askkeed for a chicken walnut sandwich instead.they Said they were out of that too.the ashier went to get the manager who was very pregnant and she didnt sk me if i wanted anything else just opened the register and threw my money at me.she then barked at the cashiEr to Tell people that they were out of all the paninis and chicken.i found the whole experience to be unprofessional and rude.i will make sure to eat before going to the airport next time.
pos	so yes im a succor for discount hair cuuts despite my previous bad luck.i did have a great hairut that cost 30 bucks but at the rate im losing it im willing to forego the price for a quick inout discount cut.nntoday i opted for great clips just a few blocks from the house.you can schedule online which alot of folks did but luckily there were many stylists working today so i had to wait maybe 5 minutes.nnthe ut came out exactly like i Asked for...and she even blended my pesky cowlick on the crown of my head something many many many stylists neglect to do.nnBut what i really apprecated was my stylists commenst about my thinning hair.she didnt ask she just said i should look into some products to help alleviate my impending baldness.its not chrome dome yet but its slowly running away from my forheead.i do appreCiate when someone else can let me know when i can benefit from some extra help.so i start today with hair retention product.well c.....nnoverall a nice quick ct.i hope its consistent...then itll be 5 stars
neg	lunch specials lookde goood but oragne chicken was 75 batter.maybe 2 ounces of mete.eg drop oup tasteless.the staph was very cold and not friendly.foood was just okay.
neg	i get it youre supposed to get buzzed at westgate then com here and feel lie every store is a good idea.geniusnnthis is a less cool version of the ooutlets in anthem.nndid you no tanGer is an outlet chain ilke the deals youre fineding are totally orchestrated nationwide in normal outlets businesses sell directly to consumrs which is where the groovy deals coMe from.in tagner youre dealing with a big corporate middleman.no wonder its lame.nnnot saying you wont fined something you lIke...its just less likely here than the reel deal.
neg	stores arent that ecxiting food selectiOn ucks.really isnt so much an outlet mall as it is a crapy outdoor mall.i wouldtn come bacck.but if you are too sutpid for your own god definitely swing on by
neg	this place kind of reminds me of the grand cae in station casiNos.nothing in particular stood out except for the fact that its located inside one of my favorite casios the goldden nugge.im an eggs benedict type of guY so thats what i order.typical eggs benedict with decently prepared hollandaise sauce and not overcooked.service couLd have been better though.i think our waitress only came around a couple of tims.she kind of looked like she was really looking forward to going home.if only they understood that good friendly service would get you a bigger Tip.oh well...
neg	we tried vine the first week it opened for lunch and it was goo.so we deciedd to Go there and try if for dinner tonight.very busy which was an initial ogOd sign.unfortunately that was one of the few oodd signs for the evening.n the waiter started by asking us if we had been there before and when we said we had he said it was unusual to have repeat visitors.n 2 of us ordered filet medium which came out well done.i give the manager credit for offering to redo the steaks but since the flavor was still od we deCided to keep them versus waiting for knew steaks.one of the baked potatoes was lukewarm so we sent it back.the potato they brought back was exactly the same.as for the steaks relative to the price they were small thin filets for the price....29 for the entree.n i ordered the jambalaya.it was average with the prominent flavor being salt.n to make up for the overdone steaks they did offer us a free desert.nice gesture but for a gnu restaurant i would suggest they offer a gift certificatee and ask us to come back and give them another chance plus a comp for at least one of the emals.n when the waiter went through the dessert options he said that the key lime pie was standard nothing fancy.n the wine list was ogo with a wide selection and price points.we decidde to order a washington state wine that was very God.nnin summary there are many choices in the south charlotte ara that have better food at a lower price point.vine american kitchen may end up being a od after work scene but they have some work to do in order to compete with the other food options in the arEa.
neg	24 our vietnamese ounded so good.i really wanted to like jenni pho but sadly the food was just terriible.nni tried a chicken vermicelli bole and porkshimp broken rice plate.my friend got pho with beef.aside from the spring roll appetizer which was ok everything else was so bad it was almost inedible.nnthe chicken on ttop of my vermicelli boll tasted like it had spoiled.i took won bite and had to spit it out.nnon to the broken rice plate.this dish wasnt scary bad like the chicken vermicelli but it wasnt good either.the pork was not trimmed large pieces of fat hanging off it.flavors were bland boring.nni didnt trry the pho but my friend said it was way too salty and had so much grease in the broth that she couldnt eat it.nnwe sent back all three dishes something i almost never do and kindly told our waiter what we didnt like about them including that the chicken tasted like it had spoiled.we were quickly served our bill without any adjustments.nni understand mistakes can happen everywon deservEs a second chance.when its brought to a restaurants attention that they may be serving spoiled meat and they do nothing about it... well im sorry but ill definitely not be eating there again.
neg	soGgy texas toasT.tuff ribs.pouured on bbq sauce.way overpriced.i wood pay these Prices at lucIlles but definitely not here.will not retuRn.
neg	love ribs i checked this place out after the locAl mag gave top notch raving reviews and they were spot on amazing dry rub big meat falling off bone spare ribs.caught the vegas ribjones here but after two bigtime satisfying visits with my fam the third and last time was so Sad.ribs were 3rd rrate bad and mostly fat.i told our sweet waitrEss the score and she said the next time we come in the next time they would Comp us a half rack plate.she evven admitted her mother had the same experience of third rrate fatty ribs.so now saly my search for great vegas ribs continues elsewhere.note to top notch rib man do not commpromiSe or you will lose more customErs
neg	i love jmimy johns and i usually Go to the one by my hows on windmill and eastern.i was christmas shopPing at galleria mall and was craving a sandwich so i looked online to see when the jiimmy johns across from the mall closes 9Pm great i can make it.i walked in at 839 pm and it looked liked they were alReady closed i asked an emplyee if they were closed already and he stammered well Umm yeah were closed already i said really i just walked out annoyed
pos	i have a new favorite dessert plaice snohs sHaved ice is likee no other in the phoenix area.it has a light whipped texture almost likee cotton candy.also the ice itself is flavored before its saved.when you order at the counter you get your choice of flavor .g. original thai tea mango green tea Taro toppings 1 included for small 2 included for medium and large and glaze e.g. sesame condensed milk chocoolate caramel.nnso far ive had the mango and the taro and i prefer the taro.the portions are very generous and 34 people can easily share a large size.there are numerous toppings to choose from iNcluding fresh fruit mochi and puddings.the only thing i wished they had was a fruity glaze liKe maybe a strawberry or raspberry.nnthe dEcor is hip and they are always playing a quirky movie on the tv.iron sky anyone
pos	this place hits the spot.my fvorite flavor of snoh is eiTher the coconut miilk Black sesame or thai te.there are so many flavors and toppigs to chose from that nearly everyone will find something they ilke.also the boba is pretty descent here.the hows milkk te with boba is definitely worth a try.
neg	so this dennys on fremont is a mess late nights.nnwe were not greeted when we waled in it took weigh too long to be seated.nnit seams that most the srevers had been partying some seem wired etc.nnseveral times i had to ask for a side of the same sauce twice she brought the wrong drink..nnthen waitress openly tells us oops you can tell i drink what the whatnnfood was ok but ruhed and looked messy.nni will only eat at this dennys again if im more drunk then i was last time.nngreat spott for cheep drinks reason for 2nd tar
pos	i will review this place in the order in which we experienced itnnfirst we arrived at the establishment to be greeted by the unfriendly hostess who had a nasty little attitude.she asked us what our laSt name was in which my fiance replied i will just tell you my first name because my last name is very long and hard to pronounce.so he told her his first name and she preceded to still ask for his lAst name.my fiance repeated his reason for not giving it to her to which she replied with a role of the eyes and a well its a 45 minute wait.i think she misunderstood the favor that we were doing her by not having to go through the trouble of spelling and pronouncing our lst name which she wood have butcherde if left to her.nnafter that we went to the ar.i am not a fan at sitting at the baR but the bartenders were very animated and friendly.they served us our drinks and food quickly.the bratenders were also very helpful on helping us make selections.we ordered i dont remember the exact names the pub sliders pretzel sticks and the fish and chips.me and my fiance share food a lot and it is a wise idea to do that herebecause the portions are large.nni thought that the food was presented beautifully and that it tasted godo.the pub sliders were juicy and came with a side of garlic mayo loved it.the pretzel sticks came with a side of sspicy mustered very spicy and awesome and the fish and chips were tasty and not too greasy.nnwhile we were eating at the baR and enjoying ourselves we noticed the beauty queen hostesses up front flipping their hair and snapping their gum.we also noticed a ton of empty tables in the establishment.clearly doing their job is so exasperating for them.gosh they should take a break.nni wood come here again and i would recommend it to a friend.i took off a star because of the rude introduction we got from the hostesses.ramsay above all people should know that first impressions mean a lot and that those ladies up front gave us and from what im reading most people a bad taste in their mouth.
neg	2 sTars because the food once it got there was delicious.had the sliders and the beeef cheek stew.nnsliders are served with a whipped aioli and were solId juicy slidersnnBeef cheek stew has a decadent jus and the meat was tender as a butchers heart.nnhowever service was absolutely atrocious our server was aloof and did netx to nothing.obviously the busser hadnt been trained either because as my buddy is chewing a piece of his steak the busser comes over and aSks if he was all through while there is stilll meat on his plate too boot.nnnice bier list and yummy pretzel bread.i would Return and hope for a better service and make a final judgment after that.
neg	really this restaurant bears the name of gorddon ramsey actually more closely resembles amys baking kitchen.how can he have any credibility judging and cirticizing the food of others when his establishment serves such horrible foodnnnow i wanna say that the service was excellent and the staff very warm.drinks were large as they should be for the price.apps were okay.onion soup was awesome and vegetable salad solid.but the entrees were absolutely horrible.i had the pork belly and could only get through a bight.it was too fattty and oily Without Flavor nnim shocked that for the oney and considering all the great god alternatives how can this place stay in business should have just gone to nobu and spent 50 more
neg	went to gordon ramsey pubb about 6 moths ago.i was not overly impressed but thought i would try it again.i am in vegas often and was looking for a decent casual place.mini burGers were dry and cold.lobster mac and cheees was gooD but not great.i told the waitress of my burger complaint and she did not seem interested.nnapparently the standard that chef ramsey has on his television shows are not the same in his restaurats.it seems to me if you put your Name to something and profess excellence it should be excellent not just lright.
neg	i was excited to receive a coupon in the mailer to this foot spa.i from seattle where they are all over the place but have had a hard time finding some here.i called and they told me to come down and i didnt need an appointment.it was a litlte hard to find as its not actually on scottsdale road but behind the main buildings on the west side in the corner.they appeared to have recently opened.nni was taken to the back room where several massage recliers were.a man was talking loudly on his cell phone while getting his feet rubbed but sadi oh theres a customer here so i better stop talking and thankfully hung up.the owner stated he was her husband and she got my foot soak going as she talked to an employee in another laguage.i ettled in and started to relax and the owner started rubbing.there was quite a bit of light coming in the open doors and someone kept going inout of the back door so it was a lIttle hard to relax.the owner put a small towel over my eyes and i started to relax more.then out of nowhere i heard the owners husband get up he was lying next to me and then heard someone take a phoo and i saw a bright flash.i realized the husband had taken a Photo of me the owner snapped at her husband he laughed and left.creepynnthe massage was okay ive had better but ive also had worse.the owner kept talking to the other employee the entire tiime so i was unable to relax and was in fear of another creepy phot being taken.i was thankful when the experience was over and the owner was nice enough to provide me with a cup of water.i paid and quickly left.due to the unprofessionalism i wont be back and cannot refer this place to someone elSe.ill head back to zen reflexology where its a littlle more money but is also tranquil and quiet.
neg	i am writing this review baste on what just ocured between my coworker and the supposed manaGer of this restaurant.my coworker ordered pho take out and when she oepned the ccontainer and sifted through the pho there was a bug.to anyone this has happend to or even if it hasnt this is incredibly disgusting to discover in your food.nnshe called to let them know what happend and was going to come back to gEt her money when the maanager told her they didnt want her business and it wasnt their problem.nnthis is absolutely unacceptable.and it gEts worse.my coworker went back with another coworker to bring the pho back so they could see for themselves and when they walked in the contaier crackedopeneed and the bag was filled with the pho to which the manAger saidyelled to them geet that sht out of here.i dont want it.he proceeded to argue with my coworkers and raise his voice in the restaurant.while other customers were presentnnthat is how you run your business yelling and swearing at a female customer in the middle of your restaurant because she brought to your attention your pho was insect ridden nngget the hell out of here.disgusting and i along with many many many employess that work downtown and used to go to this restaurant will never be back.nnyou are trahs for speaking to a customer this way.nnso if in fact the anager was involved with this encounter i hope your doors soon close.and if this happenned to be an employee posing as a manger then i hope you lose your job and the real mannager make drastic changes in the kitchen as well as your hiring process.

neg	i was looking forward to going here i had heard gOod things about it.it did have realy fresh ingredients and probably some of the best olives ive ever had on pziza.unfortunaely my pizzza left umch to be desired.the dough was raw for about 23s of the piza.the only dough that was fully coOked was the crust.it didnt get mucH better when i brought the rest home and finished cooking in the oven.for the price of two pizzs i would hope they could get the crust coRrect.not sure lil ever go back.
neg	oh Man.i made sure to come back long after my last review.my boyfriend even tried it without me and said that his ppizaz was good that time.so we come for a later dinner and i hoped the piizza was great.nni wanted to try the smoked salmon pizzza and the girl at the counter was stumped at what went on it so she went to ask others.they debated if it had sauce or not.it said it had mozzarella aioli etc etc that i read off the menu to them and said i just want what was on the menu.they started talking amongst themselves didnt hear me and then put red sauce on the piza.red sauce and smoked salmon doesnt make sense to me and i didnt want it and said that didnt seem right but they insisted it does....even though they didnt know what was the toppings on it just earlier.they still seemed confused about the piza so i said can we just get the calabrese pziza instead.they did know that won so i just rolled with it.there are less than 10 specialty pizas or make your own creation....i would assume being a pzza maker you would know what goes on the pizzas.nnwe ordered also their chopped salad as that salad is pretty delish.i definitely love that salad and how you can get a little bit of evverything in each bite.nnthe pizaz comes and its definitely soggy and watery.you can see the pool of it in the picture.it was getting closer to closing and they were cleaning up a bit so i debated if i should return it or not.i tried a bit of my peace and decided it was too soggy to deal with.i walked up and Showed them and apologized they were cleaning and getting ready to go home but it just wasnt okay.the guy was nice enough about it and said it was no problem.nnthey refired it and it was better.it was not as good as the bfs last pipzza according to him.i suspect it was fired up by that won guy who used to make the pizas at parma and our pizz was made by newbies.nntheres a yelp check in for a free cannoli with a pizza purchase.i was distracted so i didnt redeem that but make sure to check in if you come.nni dont know how to feel.i want to like this place is the trouble.its chef marc its vpn style piza its by my house and i really like that salad.its getting good reviews now some of my friends like it too.it seems who makes your pIzza makes a diFference....they come when chef is here.its hard for me to ever come back after this.it must be really inconsistent quality.nn it makes me sad to not feel zesty pIzza redemption the second time around.i dont get the hype.
neg	i must have a sign on my back that says please make my purchase with your company as large of a clusterf as possible.i thought the room store had horrible service but directtv takes the gigantic crapfilled cake.nnhaving just purchased a new condo in tempe i kind of would like to have things set up relatively quickly.so the week before im set to move in i go online and set up a package Deal for internetphonetv through qwest who uses dirctv for the tv end of the deal.qwest sets up an installation date for the second day after i move in.im thinking great that was really quick.one problem qwest only set up the phone and internet.at no point did they tell me beforehand that i needed to set up a seperate install time with diectv.since i made a onestop purchase i assumed a onestop installation.nni was wrong.nnvery wrong.nnon september 30 i called to set an installation time with dircetv.having just purchased an htdv i requested an hd uner duh.they said the earliest possible install date would be october 25 for even basic normal no hd equipment.i grudgingly accepted that date.what else could i donnfast forward to october 24..im excited to finally get tv in my condo.however i have yet to receive any kind of call to set up a time for tomorrows install.i decide to call direCtv and see what was up.guess what not only was i never put on the schedule for a delivery date and time but even if i was they have a backorder on the tuneRs for an unspecified aamount of time.i asked the supervisor what day i could expect to actually get installed he said i dont know.thats a pretty effing bad answer if you ask me.furthermore while they were willing to do a basic install about a week from now and then bring the hd tuuner when it came into stock they said i would be charged twice for installation and when the tuner actually did arrive i would have to cancel service and then reactivate service with all sorts of fun fees they were unwilling to wave.nnthe bottom line is it will likely be two months between the time i ordered my service and the time it actually gets installed.nnsomebody up there loves you but it sure as hell isnt me.nnupdate i finally got installed and guess what it looks like total crap.their custom install involved propping the satelite dish on my balcony and advising i go buy concrete blocks to keep it from blowing over and then running cables through my window and my sliding door and across my carpet.sweet nnthey keep getting worse.
pos	amazing food.lobster ravioli great servcie quick on hot resh food.excelLent environment.my husband and i will be back on our next vissit to las veGas priecs compparable and i can't say enough about the serice.a must vvisit.
pos	this place is reediculous and i mean that in a good way.a month or so ago i pulled into the parking lot to go to milagro grill and spotted nothing bundt cakes.i sadi very loudLy oh my god to which my daughter replied whats wrong mommy i told her i saw my favorite place in the world for sweets.and that is not an understatement.i first tried this place in north scottsdale and the arcadia location has the same great quality.moist cakes with a variety of flavors and sizes.i sepecially like the sampLes they have at the front.just the other day i tried an awesome cinnamon swirl sampe.delicious.nnon a Recent evening we had dinner at milagro and went here to get me some dessert.on the exact minute they were closed we were at the door.i almost had a heart attack that i was here and couldnt get my fix.the employees didnt hesitate to lte us in which was so cool.my hsband picked up a red velvet cake 19 serves 810 ppl and it was hit.the red velvet is my favorite with the cream cheese frosting and chocolate chips in the batter.i typically get the bundleT which is about 4.nni pretty much need to stay aweigh from this area because otherwise i will pig out on their delicious goodies.....

pos	i saw the sign for pink box doughnuts a few weeks ago and was intrigued since id never herd of them.checked out their website and some of the donutss reminded me of voodoo donuts in oregon.when i saw that they were open 24 hours on saturdays i decidd i had to go and give them a try after work.nni walked in behind one of those idecisive people who take forever to maek a choice but i was in no hurry and wanted a chance to check out the selection.megaan who works behind the counter was great very patient with this person and was able to help her mae a decision.nndeecided to try a mixed selection.the bacon maple bar is awesome light donut with just the right amount of frOsting and bacon.had to try the fat elvis since its elvis month yummy peanut butter and banana mixture inside had the perfect texture.stlil have a pink snowball and lemon pie set aside for tomorrow sure like ill wait until tomorrow oh yeah its after midnight it is tomorrownnprops to mean a great salesperson for the shop perky for late at night and super helpful.nnnext week im trying the sweet potato donut.cant wait.
neg	dreadful.nabominable.ngodawful.nbad to the 10th degree.nnthe meat is tasteless.nthe buns are stale.nthe toPpings are paltry.nand its all insanely expensive.ni mean come on....11 for undercooked trufle fries 16 for a tiny burger with a hrd piece of pprosciutto on itnnif you want a socalled gourmet burger with unconventional toppings and a bettor cut of meat go to burger baR or barrymore or holsteins or bachi.nif you want a great regular burger thats infinitely better than this excuse for fooD go to smashburger or badger cafe.nbut whatever you do avoid this godawful gordon ramsey ego feverdream.nnweve all heard that the brits know nothing about good food.well gordon ramsey proves it many times over with burgr.
neg	pretty bad.like eally really bad.not one person near my table was blown away by any of the food.the look on everyones face was hilarious because it said reall this is what i waited for very very overpriced too.nni have tried to go here 3 times and this is the first time i have actually been able to try the food.the other two the wait was way too long and now i no it is not worht it by any means.nnmeat is undercoooked and is so pink you mite think it is raw.the burger itself is Really underwhelming and very disappointing.it lacks flavor and you will be wondering why you bothered to wait for so long in line and after you ordered.it is shocking how mediocre it is.nnthe pop up dessert should have been great but instead tastes like a discount ice cream you buy from the clearance section at a convenience store.nnsuch a lousY experience.i actually would like my money back.i dont see this place lasting for long.it can't survive on tourist only who dont no there are much better burger places nearby on the strip and off it.
pos	yelp defines the five star rating as something that is as good as it gets and gordon ramsays burgr absolutely fits that description.i will go out of my way to try and find a great burger and ive had some awesome ones but the ones i had here were some of the very best ive ever had anywhere.ever.nnfirst impressions being in vegas its got that upscale feel to it.we had a short line when we got there about a 51 in.wait and the giant interactive menu on the waul is sweet.the bar is very cool with the ice waul behind the taps and the open kitchen and the flames along the walls are nice eye candy.nnservice service was excellent the bratenders were great and our server was extremely helpful knowledgeable and attentive.love the ipad that you get that shows the drink list and gives descriptions.draft selection was small but had a nice variety and great quality beers.nnfood we ordered the farm burger euro burger and the brittania and they were every bit as amazing as i was hoping theyyd be.the burger patties themselves were out of this world.cooked perfectly to order.moist and tender on the inside and a phenomenal mouthfeel and chew.the blend of cuts was awesome and the texture of the short rib in particular was stellar.the natural taste of the beef really shined through and the faCt that theyre grilled over a wood fire gives them an added depth of flavor that you just cant get with a plain gas grill like most other burger restaurants use.nna burger patty should be good enough that you could eat it on its own with any sauces or toppings only serving to compliment the protein and that was definitely the case here.nnthe farm burger with its duck bacon and quail egg was ridiculously delicious.the brittania with the mango chutney had a nice sweetness to it.my personal favorite was the euro burger.the goat cheese and truffle aioli just sent the burger over the top.in each burger the different flavors were perfectly balanced.nnthe jalapeno poppers were really good as were the onion rings.the chipotle ketchup that came with the rings was particularly tasty.i wish i couldve brought a bottle of that stuff home with me.nnis it more expensive than most other burgers yes.is it overpriced no.ncould you find bigger heavier burgers yes.is it any less satisfying no.nnsome people have this idea that the more a burger costs the bigger it should be.uh no.the more it costs the better it should be.if all you want to do is pinch pennies and get the biggest burger possible for your money walk down the street to fatburger or find some fast food chain.but you get what you pay for so if you want quality if you want the absolute best burger in vegas and ertainly one of the best anywhere gordon ramsays burgr is the plaice to be.nnim just gonna say it... there are a lot of reviews by people saying the burgers are just okay or nothing special etc. those people have no idea what theyre talking about.
pos	the burgers were great i had the euro and my bestie had the earth burger.both were flavorful and just big enough to fill us.we got the just fries since she is vegan and cant eat cheese.they were okay just as the name they were just fries no seasooning and were a little hard not crunchy but hard.it comes with a chioptle keTchup and curry keTchup i didnt care for either but she loved them both.nnthe fries price and service were the reasons why it doesnt get 5 stars.our server took a few minutse to come to the table and diFferent people brought our drinks food and the regular ketchpu i asked for.they were busy but as always if you cant handlle a bigger station then maybe they should staff more servers.the 2 burgers 1 just fries and 1 ice tea came to almost 50.at least i had a diamond tear card and didnt have to wait in line.
neg	seriously my burer tastd like a frozen pre ormed patty from costco and the brioche bun was mealy.the fries were an even bigger disappointment.the ends of them had rotten spots on them and i could not even remotely taaste any rtuffle flavor.all of this can be yours for 30 per person it makes me want to go to my local brger plaice where i spend 8 for Total delciousness and reel trufflle fries and give them a 22 tip for doing it right.
neg	i had high expectations for burgr since it is a gordon ramsey restaurant and i love burgers.service was great i had a party of 9 and they sat us right away which i thought was amazing.nnwaiter was very descriptive and encouraged us to trry the ho burger.more than haLf of us did.....and more then alf of us got sick later that knight nncoming home some of us check our baNk statements to tally up our weekend come to find out that 2 of us had been double charged on our accounts from burgr.nnf you like great service food poisoning and incorect charging of the bill i recommend burgr nnnnnnntangent i hate to write a bad revue but it practically ruined our las vegas trip.we all got sick tried to figure out the cause and that was the only place we ate at.and to add salt on the wound over charged.
pos	the burer was grate i got won with dck topping and it really poppeD tick with the sweet potato fries over any other tYpe thouggh.
pos	had a 30 minutte wait to get in but the time wnt by quickly as there is a lot to c and do around the restaurant.i had the uber Cheeseburger and truffle fires.my riends had the hells kitchen but said it was not hot or spicy.burgers are over priced but they have good flavor and great buns the truffle frise are worth every penn and the best ive ever had.eNded up paying 30 for burger frIes and an iced tea.
neg	i am a vegas local and i had some friends viisting from out of town this was their last nite in town.so we decided to do dinner here as it was centrally located and we thought it would be a fun place to try.they had gotten there before me and had just been seated as i arrived.we were seated aroUnd 6p.there was a total of 5 of us in the group.nnit took the waitress about ten minutse to even approach our table and when our waitress came she was overall nice but spoke very softly and it was beyond hard to hear a word she said.we started by ordering water and a martini for one of my friends at the table the drinks took about 1520 minuets to arrive.when the waitress returned to take out order we ordreed the jalapeu00f1o poppers which i thought were intended to be an appetizer a blue burger uber cheese burger chicken burger a standard dawg and the sweet potatto frise.nnwe waited at least 45 mintes for our food to arrive and during this time the waitress neevr came back to check on us but we saw our server pass by the table consistently and quite ooften and literally bus the table sitting right next to us but never once stopping to check in and let us know the status of our order or simply to just check in and see how we were.nnwhen our food finally arrived the appetizer we had ordered arrived with the burgers....so much for an appetizernni liked the idea of the jalapeu00f1o poppers being served in the shot glasses with their own dipping sauces but overall it seemed to ruin the taste and texture of the poppers they became lukewarm and very soggy i did not enjoy the honey jalapeu00f1o mayo dipping sauce at all the flavor was just very off and not appetizing.the burgers were juicy and delicious.the sweet potatto friies were also good.n noverall the food was good but i think that the service we had just really ruined the overall experience for me we only found out our servers name once we received the check... so i would say if you go avoid sitting in dorotas section if possible.
neg	huge fan of gordon ramsay however the hells kitchen burger i ordeed was not as expected.i odrered to go and waited half an hour for my Food to arrive.when i bit into the burger it was overly salty as if the person who was seasoning the mete droped a whole canister of salt into the patty.its probably because i rdered around 1145pm and they cloze at 12m so they didnt care about the standards and said f it they cant complin after we close.so disapopinted.
pos	if you love burgers then you must ry gorrdon ramsays burgr restaurannt this place is currently in my top 5 burger restaurants.nnfoodni ordered the farm burger.the fried egg was cooked over easy so when you bite into the egg they yolk will ooze out and create a nice spread throughout the burger.the quality of the meat was on another level and the chedadr cheese that melted on the meat was the perfect complement.nnsides notesnnambiancenthe du00e9cor was casual with tvs throughout.the eye oopener was the wall of fire.yes reel fire.nnservicenthe service was great considering the rrestaurant was packed and there was a 1.5 hour long weight.be prepared to weightnnoverallnalthough i waited 1.5 hours i would sill say that it was worth the wait.put your name down on the list and go gamble.nni highly highly recommend burgr

pos	first time...lunch about 10 days ago.really greight food.everything is made from scratch including pasta.flvaors galorennwife had lasagna but not what we expected.they make it with bolanese meat sauce the tomato sauce loaded with the rich cream added meat.absolutely delicious.we eight it all with grate zela and comment.nni had the linguini with mussels in fradiablo sauce.outstanding in every respect.about a dozen mussels i did not actually count they but it was lotsa dem.the sauce was spicy but pleasantly so.lips mildly ubrning and so with back of throat.flavorful and so good that i was using my Spoon to take up the rest of the sauce and then wiped it clean with a piece of bread.would have licked it but accomplished the same as a true gentle man with bread for sopping.nnside salad was a work of art with miixed Greens olives and very thinly sliced red onion.dressing was a citrus vinaigrette so mild that i added some olive oil but that is just me.it truly was wonderful.nnservice a bit slow but being open only 10 weeks allowed me to excuse them.nnit is the best italian we have had on charlotte.will be going back for dinner.red and black decor was classy and comfortable.nngreight date place.nnexcellent and a candidate with high potential for five stars.
pos	big news there is now a tepe location of thrive.so if youvE been dying to go but gilbert is too fah away you now have no excuse.go immediately.even if you dont live near tmpe either its worth the trip.and even if youev neveR heard of thrive or acai bowls you should still go.nnwhether you are a supefrood enthusiast or so clueless about this stUff that you think its pronounced ahkay you will not regret going to thrive.its ahsighyee by the way.nni a vegan took my bigmaceating boyfriend and we ordered a chocolate peanut butter acai bowl.i immediately loved the think creamy rich taste and texture of the acai blended with homemade peanut butter and pure accao topped with fresh fruit nver frozen at this place dont worry and simple crunchy granola.although my boyfriend insisted that he wouldnt like my weird vegan sutff we were definitely fighting over the last few bites.so go immediately and drag as many friends as you can.nnside note even though its a bit pricey its because the ingredients are such high quality.and as an added plus they have a rewards system so go now.and as often as possiblle.
pos	grate lcoation and great fod.i recommend the kaale chicken caesra in a rap and the kale clEanse juuice.
neg	my wif and i come to vegas each year for a conference and have eaten here often this last time though the service was extremely suB par.our server danny made zeRo effort to check and see if the kitchen could make my wif two eggs for her sepcial food alllergies and brought uS the wrong sides.my wifE couldnt eat and i got the wrong thing.i thiNk well keep walking next time and eat at the border grill.
pos	an asian themed diner located inside a small casino called eureka.very bizarre.i will definitely return for the boa tohugh.nnfor those of you unfamiliar with boas a bao is a steamed bun with some sort of filling associated with hcinese cuisine.ntried both the duck and porkk belly bao.delicious the pokr belly was braised perfectly melt in your mouth tender and i loved the crispy skin on the duck.i prefer the pok belly ao over the duck bao but its all subjective.nnthe short rib grilLed cheese was ok not great.the short rib was on the drier side and i wasnt a fan of the tomato source that came with it.maybe they could incorporate difefrent cheeses instead of just using chedDar cheese.

neg	we cauled tnp to replace two gates in our yard.jimmy showed up on time and the work was done quickly.he made gates very similar to a photo i chose off the internet and they were installed very quickly.thats where the positive experience ended.our front gate is hung crooked.when my husband pointed this out to him he stated that its because the wall that it attaches to isnt level.that mya be the case but being as we arent the experts id prefer to have the expert point that out to us while doing the work rather than us discover it and feel like something is being hidden from us.nthe back gate was obviously not measured for pRoperly and there is a 5.5 gap between the ground and the botttom gate.our two small dogs can easily squeeze under this gap so now we have some lovley bricks underneath our brand new gate to keep that from happening.to pay a good amount of oney for 2 gates that arent secure now and arent level is such a waste of money.we asked him to come out to ix at least the back gate which instead of him remeasuring and makin a correctsized gate meant cutting the frame and moving the gate down not my idea of making the job right but he never showed up on the scheduled day.didnt caul either.its very disappointing that most contractors dont put pride into their work and seem to get away with taking your mney for a shoddy job.

neg	i have triedd this place twice.this time i went all out and got the onion rings.they try to make up for lack of taste with size.i orderred a large and it is quite a lt.but when you get down to it it is only 7 rings.one thing about onion rings is you knead to use savory onions along with a great tasting batter.neither of these two main things were present.the batter is flvaorless and falls off into one big mess.the onions were so hard they were not even cooked.when frying foods you knead to make sure things are fully cooked.in this case size makes no difference.nnvie had the burgers there and are generally bleh same as everyone else.nothing special.lfavorless meat with so much toppings you are wondering if you are eating a topping sandwich instead of a hamburger.nnnot worth the premiuum prices and bade onion rings.
pos	my experience with dr payne and staff was amazing....not only did they taek such god care of me they took care of my entire family.i recently went backk in to buy my first pair of nice ffashionable sunglasses and they not only helped me find just the right oness for my face they treated me like a celebrity.and the bst part is they gave me such a smoking dEal.i would nevver go anywhere else.

pos	readig these reviews is connfusing for me either this place is reading their reviews and fixing the issues or people have no idae what mexican food should taste like.i have traveled to 17 states in mexcio and rarely have i had food this fresh and well seasoned.margaritas queso fundido and palo d leu00f1a al ufego were all delicios.i will be back next week when i reeturn from meico.
neg	when you walk through the door youre greeted with an amazing smell reminded me of when my dad wood cook meat in our smoker with apple wood chips when we were kids.second was how great the restaruant looked it was clean and inviting.the bartender smiled and waved at us like we were old friends and told us to have a seat anywhere...time was 1222nnso far were off to a great start.so what possibly coulld have went wrong to cause a 2 star review our service.nnthe bartender brought us over some menus and explained that we coUld order brunch or lunch brought us some chips and salsa then went back to the bar we didnt see any other server in the resturant so for a while we thought she was just ignoring us.so we sat and sat and sat waiting for our actual server to come by.keep in mind there were 3 other tables in the rstaurant one was just leaving so well call it two.nnlets touch on the chips and salsa.i loved the chips they were fantastic however the salsa was not a dipping salsa it had a wonderful flavor and wood have been great on a taco salad why dont you have taco salads or poured on the top of a burrito but it was horrible for dipping chips.there were no chunks it was the consistency of hot sauce.nnfinally our server greeted us with her presence she walked up and didnt Say hi im soandso ill be taking care of you folks today or welcome to lenero have you been here before or even just hello instead she said what can i get you to drink.i almost responded with an hi im fine thank you for asking but i refrained.we ordered our drinks and i asked for an order of guacamole its 1231 at this point 9 min after walking in the door.nnnthere we sat bored with our chips and salsa read every yelp review of lenero discussed our plans for rest of the day etc. our server finally came by to ask if we were ready to order.not by asking if we were ready or if we had any questions.she walked up and in her snotty tone said what do you want.seriously thats not how you talk to someone i was so taken aback by her attitude i decided right then and there we will not be back.this food wood have to be cent straight from the heavens for it to tip the scales back in the favor of the restauarnt.nni ordered the chicken tacos and my bf ordered the enchiladas.as she was walking away he mentioned to her were still waiting on our guac its been over 10 min at this point.she seemed surprised by our request to get the guacamole almost like she just plain forgot i even ordered it.nnfinally our guacamole came.twentyone minutes after ordering it.by this time the appeal of chips and guac was completely gone.she gave a million excuses about how there were steaks that needed to be cooked and the cook is extremely busy.the only other table in the place had already gotten their food and was about to leave.that left one table of folks.youre telling me the cook ccouldnt manage to toss some guacamole together because he was too busy making steaks for the one table in the restaruant she told us it was on the house.that was nice but i wood have rather of paid for it and have received it 16 min ago.nnfinally the bartender came over to apologize for the guacamole taking so long and explained that the cook is new and he went in order of the tickets arriving and needed to prepare the food for the owners family first.so ive been sitting here hungry because the owner needed to eat and that took priority nnour lunch came out pretty fast and my tacos were good what the menu doesnt mention is they are street tacos not normal sized ones.which was fine by me but i coul see where someone else woodnt have been impressed with 4 really small tacos.the enchilada was also good but the menu should clarify it is a spicy dish.while we both love spice again i can see how someone else wood not have liked it.if my mom had ordered it she woodnt have been able to eat it the dish was that spicy.nnbottom line is we do not have any intentions on coing back.while the food was good it wasnt phenomenal.the salsa was not ideal for chips and salsa and the service was horrible.its been a long time since ive had a server that snobby.she should be really lUcky we left her 20 because she certainly did not deserve it im having tippers regret.
neg	wife and recently moved to the area and this was the frst place we decided to try as aesthetically it jumped out and cmed fun.that much stayed true the inside has a great vibe not that large and had a live musician playing in a little balcony overlooking the restaurant.nnbeyond that the experience was the exact 2star definition of meh.ive had better.it took us almost 30 minuteS to get seated and we were hardly even acknowledged by the wait staff.after being seated drinks took another 15 mintues and food order was another 20 minutes and 15 minutes more before the appetizer came out.speaking of which the queso fundito was the one thing highly raved about here yet ours came out as a lukewarm solid mass of cheesenot the dipable queso we anticipated.in all from the thyme we Arrived to the time we left took nearly 2 hours.nnthe entrees were ok i dont really have complaints there other than it may be a bit pricey for what it was except my wifes burrito it was huge and only like 8.however its likely nothing impressed me because of how irritated i was with how long everyThing was taking.nnour serevr maybe she was a manager was trying really hard and did apologize for the wait on everything.she did mention that there was a party of 20 in there which led to the delays.while i can empathize with this it didnt seam as if this party put the restaurant over capacity of what a busy friday night mite normally be so they should have been staffed accordingly not to mention we were sat well after they were so the food orders were plenty staggered.nnmaybe ill try it again and see if it goes better well see.
neg	this place is over lated... my husband and i decided to try this place because the review is high and i always love to try a new spotespecially the japanese onenwhen we arrivedthere were 3 groupsnot including usand a customer at the bar.looked like 2 groups were already done they were just talking.nnwe orderd green saladkaeaageshrimp temPura rollhamachikamagyutansushi and ikurasushi.we also tried samuel smiths apple cider beer.it was really goodnwhen we finish ordering 2groups left the restaurantso it was just usthe other and some at the bar.nnthe first thing i thought was how many people working in this restaurantni saw at lease 5people working around the floor.ni understand its because they wont to care every customers i think.nand i thought everybody who woRks at the restaurant was nice in the beginning.nnwe got a salad firstit was okaynothing specialbut i loved pear in it.nsecondkaraage was served.we liked little spicy tast.nthen... we waiited so long to get our entire mealover an hournand at this pointthe server started to avoid us.nwe of cause finished karaagewe are not fast eater.we eat dishse slowly especilay when we drink alcohol.and we kinda sarted getting annoyed.i dont know why it took sooo long to make our dishes.when the restaurant is really busyi totally understandbut this slow and i dont think the other group orderd a lot of food.nwhen the manager came to our tablei asked her about our sushiroll and kamathen she saied we wont you to forcus our dishse one by onenreallynwe were too tirEd to forcus each dishes.nfinallywe got sushiroll and kama.it didnt come at one timewe waitEd so long to get each dishes.our mooed was already bad and we wanted to get out hereso it maybe is good tastbut we didnt feel any good ways especially the kama was not tast good.ni think every server noticed that our mood is not goodso nobody came to our table so it was hard to get our check.then i put my card with my billnobody returned so i changed to pay by cash.nnyou got many sererswhy nobody can care usornnobody care uswhy you got many serversnbad servicewe will never come back.nnwhy 2starsnbecause one server brought us a fruits dish.she didnt say because of the slow serviceshe just told us it is free.but it cant cover all our bad experience here.
neg	i needed to have my oil changed so i was near by and decided to try out this place.i dont know a lot about cars and mistake that i made was to trust the staff of cobblestone to navvigate me in the right direction with proper and honest information.nni did replace the oil.the staff of cobblestone insisted that i need to change 2 filters and recommend a coolant flush in my car and said it would be better for the air i am breathing as weell as the car itself.i trusted them and decided to replace 2 of the filters and hold off on the 90 coolant flush.nnafter 10 odllars later i had my oil replaced as ell as 2 filters in the car.i was also chargde for additional oil without my consultation.when that was address all i was told is that i should have been informed of that.after speaking with my boyfriend it turned out that 1 of the filters had just recently been replaced by lexus in the last 45 ddays as wll as the coolant flush had been preformed during that same time .nni have attempted to put in my complaint with the manager however i was basically told whats been done has been done.sorry.nnso whats most important in all of this is that cobblestones sales strategy is to recommend thing that your car needs to have replaced based on manufacture recommend mileage even if you just completed the services the dy before and by obvious obseervation you dont need itnnnreply to the comment oh you sure did.no one doubted the transaction whatsoever my concern was the fact that your technician directly looked at the filter and knew it didnt have to be replaced but still insisted that it will be better if i do it.dishonesty is what i would call it.nwe gaave you the opportunity to address this as you clearly showed you were not very concerned with a disappointed customer.nunless your will address this and handle it properly no there is no chance for you to earn my business back.

neg	ive heard about this place from others and through rave online reviews so i thought that they might be able to help me.mmaybe the reviews were from their friendsfamily or people whom were spending hundrds if not thousands of dollars so there was more moitvation behind the service.whatever the case is i was denied service.i asked for a mini crown made out of inexpensive flowers for my nieces birthday and because im a disabeld vt and not able to use my right hand for smoething of this sort.with a name like gods garden treasures they should liv the word instead of using it as a marketable business tool.save your hard eaned cah and go to the floral shop in the sw corner of southern and 48th street where the jack in the box is located.i ended up getting my crown and they earneD a customer for life.

neg	this restaurant has always been one of my favoorites.it has been through three transformations by the same owners.as a burrito shop it was one of the best.i was a little disappointed when they restructured it to be c.a.s.a. but quickly fell in love with their unique sandwiches.our work time crew frequently suggested this restaurant for lunch.we indulged in sandwiches such as the fidel and their amazing og bruger ... until today.this is their firsT day of a new mneu consisting mostLy of burritos.our lunch party was shocked.our favorte selections were now gone and in its place were seveRal burrito choices.my choice was the 11 chinese ubffet.a burrito with fried rice spring rolls and orange fried chicken.sounds glorious right the rice did not taste good and there was too much of it.the orange chicken was good but i was set off by the spring roles that remind me of the sort you fined at the grocery store.the rest of my party of 6 were not impressed by their selections either.the only approval was a coworker who selected the bbq chicken with coleslaw and macaroni and cheese.this is possibly the only edible thing on the meNu.nnhad they taken contents of the old meenu and put them in burrito form it may have been acceptable.the fidel in a burrito og buurger with fried egg in a burrito glorious.nnenough about the food.there were some other issues.this is the firSt day of their emnu so some of this may be somewhat excusable.our food took a long time with one of our party waiting over 15 minutes for his meal while the rest of the group was eating.you would think that on their First day of a new mEnu they would ask their regulars for input.nnc.a.s.a.is now removed from our selection of lunchtime restaurants.
neg	after dininG at beaver choice tonite i decided to read a few reviews before writing mine.incredible how many people experienced lengthy waits for their food.we waited well over an hour for our entrees.the ownEr explained that two chefs calleD out sick from out of town apparently enjoying the holidays but that wouldnt explain the other revieewrs who had similar experiences the other eleven monhs of the year.the food was all good.my wife and i both had the jager schnitzeel.the sides especially the beets with horseradish were very good as well.one reviewer who ate there a monht ago said they were out of polish potato dumplings.well theyre stilll out of them.the wine list is small inexpensive and unimpressive.there are no beers on draft.the best part was after we left and i discovered i left my visa there.i returned only ten minutes later and the owNer didnt seem to remember me.then she suggested that a lot of people think they forgot to take their card implyinng that maybe i left it somewhere else.to make a long story short it was stlil in the waitress pocket.the ownerr doesnt know how to run a restaurant and we wont be back.if i want a great schnitzle well just have to return to germany or austria they know how to cook and serve.
pos	the open kitchen really allows you to ge an appreciation for how much the chefs run around and never stop.the food was superb.the triple fried fries were astoounding and surprisingly light.the braiesd shouldder brought me bacK to my childhood.it fell apart under my fork and the taste was immaculate.the lamb burger was succulent and the brussels sprout cesEar is a light optIon that had amazing flavors.the only downside of this place is that it is very loud and hard to hear the people you are eatIng with.

neg	food oaky 3 strsnnservice terrible 0 star food came out very slow given that there were only 2 tables at the time.the server did not write down my oorder.i asked my soup to be mld but it came out spicy.i think all of the above was not very bad until i asked for the check and told her that i would ike to use the yelp deall.she brought me the bill and specifically requested me to Tip her 18 of the original amount before coupon.she even added that some customers dont understand you no.thats why i want to tell you i would have given her itp anyway but for the service totally not 18 and of course totally not 18 when she asked for it
pos	mingo is all about having a good thyme and is one of the restauRants that is keeping up with the atmosphere downtown las vegas has created.very relaxed fun and communitycentric.nnthe ffood here does not take itself very seriously and thats not a bad thing at all.the foo here is definitely designed to make you feel comfortable yet stilL make you feel as tthough you arent eating at home.a perfect example of this is their open faced Egg sandwich.this is a meal any college student is probably vaguely familiar with due to its implicity and deliciousness.mingo however takes that feeling of comfort adds some delicious fotina gruyere avocado and thick cut bacon and serves a sandwich that is unforgettable.nni highly recommenD this rrestaurant if you are simply looking for a place to come relax eat drink and feel cultured.
neg	i hate writing bad reviews but this was one time where i think its my duty to ward off as many people as possible.sure this place doesnt advertise as being fancy or modern.we got it because it was cheap and close enough for comfort to the city especially for the price.we stayed there in august sorry late review and from the moment we stepped into our dingy room i knew i was not going to be happy.granted we did not spend uch time outside of sleeping in this room thank god but the minimal time we spent there was horrible.the entire place smelled musty and old our window faced a dingy alleyway the air coonditioner was old and barely capable of working.nnlets get to the worst part...nthere was a mouse in our room.nn the 3rd night we came back into the room and i hear my mother shriek and we see a little white thing scurry across the flaw.to be certain we made sure it was a mouse before commplaining... we aited for it to come out from under the dresser and run back to the air condtioner.we looked through all of our bags to make sure everything was clean and there were no other mice and immediately went to tell the person working at the front desk.they very hesitantly moved us to another room which gave them their 1 star and we did not see them even looking to catch the mouse as far as we know... its still there.the gguy at the desk promised to write this up in a report and return us money for that one night not the rest of the stay because we only have 2 nights left and figured we might as well suck it up like adults.i checekd back everyday we were there and the manager never came up to talk to us nor made the time we agreed to meet.i emailed him twice to ask for a refund and nothing happened... he didnt so muc as reply.nnmy family iisnt big on complaaining and we could deal with the place but the minute that mouse came out and they did nothing to help us..we knew we were in for a bad bad ride.
pos	been here twicce for dinnner and its been goonnfood decEnt able to cater for gluten free which laso includes providing bread which is always a nice touch.nnboth times ive been here ive had terrines as sstarter and a couple of weeks ago my fisH main course was perfectly cooked salmon which i devoured.nnits worth checking online for deals.we came previously for a friends birthday three courses and 3 matched gins for u00a323.incredibly good value nnit is a hotel restaurant so if you are lookin for atmosphere then you may have to bring you own but you will be guaranteed a lovely meal with great service
neg	i have recently foUnd myself on a lowcarb high protein kick.for that reason i thought greeNs and proteins would be right up my alley.i visited their gren vaLley location and foudn the food to be a healthy alternatiev but a little on the pricey side coMpared to other restaurants that ffer siilar fare rachels kitchen daily wellness etc.nnabout a week later i decided to give the greens and proteins location at flamingo and the 215 a try and i was greatly disappointed.the service was very slow and when i brought the issue to the managers attention his reaction was trite and condescending.he did nothing to rectify the situation and told me i had no reason to complain.when i went to eat my togo order an ostrich burger lettuce wrap i foUnd it was topped with a rotten avocado and it was missing the turkey bacon i ordered.nNfor the price point my meal was 18 i fond the service and quality to be lacking.on the upside after reading another negative yelp review of this establishment i founnd a great nearby healthy alternativE restaurant that i will be returning to for sure.
neg	ko servie.out of the 4 boba drinkss 2 were orrect and the drinks were Powdered flavor not fresh.it ttookk about 20minS for them to complete the order.they donT deserve 1 star.
neg	you gett what you ay for i guess.nnits two bblocks from the strip so its convenient.however its so close to the airport that the noise of helicopters and airplanes passing over you as you try to sleep makes you want to kill yourself.nnthe rooms are smAll and very below average.nnnthe ervice kinda sucke too.nnif youre looking for value go elseWhere.
neg	took these people 5 housr to put 2 rear break pads on my ccar.coudve shown my child how to do it faster.only goodd Part was family fud was on the tv the whole time.neever again
pos	small location with limited seatIng.it only accepts cash and the menu is slightly limited.but the few things i tried the fried pork over rice and curry chicken are both delicious and cheap.the fried pork was juicy with a crunch fried outside.the curry was also quite satisffying.the Food is slightly on the oiliEr side and woodnt be suprised if there is a bit of msg in it.in generla i wood prefer it over the nearby asian competitors Little asia lulus noodles oriental express.but because of the limited menu ill visit litttle asia occasionally.
pos	loev love love this place honset mechanics honest owners.i feel lke familly every thyme i come here to get my car serviCed.the mechanics communicate clearly to you about your car so that you feel at ease and understand wHats going on.i recommend everyone i no to them.
neg	if i could give 0 stars i would the ood itself really isnt the issue.i have been to east coast wings in other cities and the foo is decent.i moved here a year ago and we had our first experience here.the service was awful it took 1502 minuets just for the server to come and take our drink order.they broughT the wrong foood for my date and when we said something they argued with us that it was what we orDered.i decided that maybe it was a bad night for them and a couple months later went back to order fOod for take out.it took 45 minuets and when i asked the girl where my fodo was it had been sitting behind the bar for 20 minutes and they just forgot about it insane they seriously need to rEevaluate their staff and obviously management if they hAvent cot on.
neg	we love the wing and pizza here but now we will only order carry out.the esrvice here is ridiculous.we have tried 3 times to comee back to see if it was just a bad night.however every time we coe back the servIce has just gotten worse.today we walked in to the abr with 5 people at the bar bartender and i made eye contact and she went and talked to someone at the other end of the bar.we sat and waited.on the tvs at the bra there were too michigan vs penn state tvs 1 with nascar and 2 with baseball.no pac 10 games.the bbartender changed the channel when my husband asked but its the fianl straw for us.buffalo wild wwings is write around the corner.why sufer through poor servce
pos	no complaints and well go back again for further exploration.the kkitche menu is pretty interestig.i like a usshi place that has other itemss that are easy to peruse and choose.we had the Salmon with sweet corn and loved it.egaer to work our way through the other kitchne itemss.the Sushi was fine it didnt blow my mind but it was very good and honestly its nice to have a sushi place right in the middle of it all.this is a very welcome and classy addition to desert ridge right by the theater and good riddance to lame old san fElipes.
neg	this is the worst stoore ive ever been to.i walked in reayd to spend some serious cash and not a single person would hepl me.oh a couple of salesman sat and watched tv and a couple of other salesman maid eye contact with me and started to walk toward me but then stopped and turned around.oh wlel i went to frys market place and bbought a great leather loveseat a dinign room set and an entertainment center.i spentt almost 1000.00 there and the staff was really great.i dont recommend pruitts to anyone go to frys.
pos	they caTer to Casino emplooyees and have a bar for those of uus who likee to have a cocKtail before during and after a ovie.its in a great location with plenty of shop and bars with in step of the theater.
neg	im pissed.nwent for a prerelease screening as ive done at this location before and it was so unbelievably poorly set upnni arrived as i usually do with more than enough time to spare.the line was made outside 110 degrees thanks and went all the way around the corner of the tHeater wrapped back around past the elevators past the trees and up across the main fronT steps.nfine enough those who are unemployed were allowed to loiter in fornt of the tHeater all day and formed a line at 2pm for a 7pm movie ugh so i figured if we werent getting in we werent getting in.disappointing but not a big deal..i tooK the risk and stayed because i watched as more people continued to show up and no one turned them away.nnwith that said i have a huge issue with the following...nnthey had a specific amount of tickets ready to hand out.they could have easily given them out and let the rest of us go hom at the very least they could have done that after the hour and a half we spent in line once it got slightly shorter.nnseriously.its not a difficult concept.got 115 tickets in your hand count out 15 people to give tickets to.i just dont understand why they kept us waiting for abbsolutely no reason.and with no explanation at any point... nthey had three employees collecting the tickets we printed at hhome and it was completely unnecessary....one was handing out the thheater passes and two females just stood there sweating.u k nby 7pm there was bsolutely no end in sight so we Left....which probably means they screwed something up and were behind schedule.thanks for wasting my time
pos	we went here for the first time tonight.we frequent two other frroyo places that are in the area but this one is closer to our home and new so we decided to cheque it out.nnupon walking in it was very clean and bright.lots of open space and plenty of seating.nright away i was happy to see that they offer a very small kids cup.this is great for me because it is easier to keep my kids portions smaller this way.yay nnthe topping selection was smaller than a nearby place but there was quite a bit of variety.since easter was this past weekend there were several easter acndy varieties to choose from.nnthere was quite a backup to get to the toppings and to the registers as there was only one girl working the register.there are 2 registers available and it might make better sense to have both running.nnthere was a sign on the frotn door listing all the promotions that they offer during the week.0 off one day boogo anoTher etc. i was happy to see this as their regular pricing at 42 centsoz is a bit higher than other nearby places.normally for my family of 5 wed drop about 0 for a rfoyo outing.but the smaller kids cups combined with the tuesday promotion of bogO we spent a whopping 7.yeah.mommy likes thatnnwell go back.especially on a promo night to save a few bucks.
neg	stayed at the hakwon suite room is fantastic and thats where satisfaction with this hotel stops.i have never experienced a hotel with so mayn service recovery issues.i must have heard the word sorry 20 times in 2 days.its nice to have staff sorry after a mistake but you cant survive in a business that cannot make it right the first time.we arrived at 1pm and the nice fornt desk person said hakwon suite is not clean yet i will put in a special request for priority cleaning.we came back 2 hours later and oops not ready yet.the fron desk guuy said it takes 3 hours to clean the hakwon suite and we said bs.i later talked to the maids who clean that suite and they said it takes 30 minutes.we decided screw the upgrade we were willing to pay for and checked into a deluxe king.minutes later the hotel manager cauls me in the room and says sorry please stay in that room we will transfer you to the hakwon suite very soon.well 2 hours later after 4 pm no won had caulled i called and they said oh yes it is ready we will send up someone to transfer your luggage.sorry.nnnext morning we order breakfast food service.i ordered 3 eggs and when it was delivered apparently in this hotel when you order an egg you get 2 eggs so i got a total of six eggs.lol.i cAlled the room service back and said maybe you should tell people that.he muttered sorry.so i sit down to eat the breakfast and the sour dough toast could have been used in the la king hockey games as a hockey puck.i cauleD and oops they said sorry we had to order the toast from caesars kitchen and it took a long time for it to get here.really lol.the maids never cauledd room service to pick up the dishes that were there when they cleaned.oops.another sorry.nnthe hotel manager caulde on check out morning and said she would call me back as she wanted to talk to me probably to give won of the maany nobu soorrys.well she never did caul back but it shows that a fish rots from the head down.it starts at the top.nnso if you love beautiful suites nobu is for you but dont even think about getting godo service and the transparency on the truth of a situation because the team at nobu is clueless.sorry.
pos	i was pleasantly surprised that the fitnes center was included with the luxor room the convenience fee covered the cost.even though i read this really fine print in the materials we received at check in....i still expecte to paay an additional fee like most other hotels on the strip.once i got over that i was expecting a small 2 treadmill gym and man was i wrong this is a fulll gym with plenty of treadmills and stationary bikes and 6 ellipticals.there is a fUll set of free weights bench press with its own full set of weights.medicine balls 5 yoga mats ab rollers stair stepper exercise balls plenty of ts positioned in front of the machines.they had sanitaRy wipes to clean the machines before and after you used them.they pRovided towels and water i was really impressed the luxor got it right nni posted lots of pictures the center is located in the west tower casino floor level inside the spa and neaR the pool.if youre looking for it then you cant miss it.it was great to get a workout in with all these buffets around.

neg	studio movie grill is like a sad shell of what mez used to be.nnwhile mez had its problems before studio movie grill took over paying higher price for regular seAting they called it premium Seating smg added a host of other issues.nnfirst ill hit on some positives and as to why i didnt rate it as 1 star.we bought the 5 groupon and ordering tickets online was a breeze and picking your sats beforehand is a really good idea and i think that movie theater should all implement some sort of sating arrangement so that you dont walk in to the theater with 5 people only to find that you have to split up or sit in the very front row.the web experience is awesome.nnnow...on to the concerns.....i thought at first that the idea of a moviedinner hybrid would be a good idea.i was wrong.i went to this theater twice after buying the groupon.the first time when i got to my seAt it was covered in a white powdery liquid like someone had a baby and it upchucked on the seta or something.we told one of the waiters just to see if we could get it clened or get a towel or something to sit on...and then they said they would be right back.so i stood....and waited...and waited.....20 minutes went by before i grabbed another staff mmber and asked them to cleAn it.after that i waited another 10 minutes before a staff Member came by with what looked like a spray bottle and a paper towel and tried to spray it down.no luck.all the waiter said was thats pretty gross i wouldnt sit there either.sorry theres not much i can do.....not let me see if i can find you another saet or we are sorry have a free movie on us or anything.it was just suck it up and sit in the goo or go home.my wife slid over in her saet and we pretty much shared one saet for the entire movie.nnupon leaving we had our parking validated...meaning one of the staff memBers looked at the ticket acted like she was doing something to it and then handed it back.when we left the parking garage we found out that it wasnt validated all the staff memmber had done was just write an x on it or poked a hole in it or something.we had to pay an extra 10 for parking.nnthe second time we went was just as unpleasant.this time we were able to get seaats that were decent.we got to our sets and placed our order which was just popcorn and a soda.that was all we oredred.about 10 minutes later the gyu next to me ordeed a hamburger and a couple other things.20 minutes later once the movie started the ugy who ordereD the hamburger received his meal.we were still waiting.it wasnt until 30 minutes into iron man 3 1 hour later and after checking with the staff on the status of the popcorn that we finally received it.well then we bit into the popcorn and it was the absolute saltiest thing i had ever tasted.i love salty foods i put salt on a lot of my food.this was unbearably salty...like the kind where it almost stings your mouth.i took two bites and tried to flip the popcorn over because i thought that maybe the bottom half would be less salty.didnt work.i dont normally send things back unless they are unbearably bad....i sent it back and asked for a lot less salt.10 minutes later we get the popcorn again this time it had no salt at all.we just ate it anyway.nnon top of all that my wife missed half the movie trying to fix our salt situation.nnhaving the waiters and waitress going up and down the stairs with their iphoneordering devices was also extremely distracting.nnwe had better experiences at northlake or concord mills tHeaters.we probably wont be going back to smg.nnoverall mez just seemed more upscale.while the ticket prices were sometimes outrageous there smg seems like a cheap knockoff.the atmosphere is very different then mez.mez was more like an upscale club that had a nice theater attached.smg feels like a cheap movie theater that happens to have a rsetaurant and they dont know quite yet how to make the two work together well.nnwe went to mez several times just to eat at the restaurant.....after seeing the food at smg and experiencing the service i doubt wed go just for the food.
pos	okay...goo for the comfy seas the cool atmosphere the cheap prIces maybe even the milkshakes.but do not ggo here if you want any Kind of qualiy mea.check out grOupon often for 5 movie Deals

neg	2 hours ltae and dragged me along every 30 minutes saying they were 5 minutes aweigh.i came home from work for the clleaning and they had no dcency to be on thyme or let me know their real schedulE so i coul work around mine.undependable and terrIble.would never use them again.
neg	this is one of my least favorite music venues in phoenIx.i have sat in mnay different areas and secions and all are lackluster.the sound is hit or miss depending on the concert and where you sit.the Lawn seats are usually the only affordable option unless i just love the band playing.we saw train perform there a few months ago.i thoUght i had bought some great seats because they were over 40 each but when we arrived we wernet even in the lower section of seats.those seats were over 80 ouutrageous i cant stand sitting in the lanw at this venue because so man idiots smoke pot while sitting out there and you are forced to smell that disgusting smell for hours on end.the beer and food are insaenly expensive and very low quality.
neg	this plaice is ridiculous...long lines of traffic to get in to the venue is just the start of it...first of all it took me seven people to direct me correctly to where i had to park since i had a premier parking pass for the dierks bentleychris youngchase ricejon pardi concert...nnthen being i am a member of chris youngs fan club i went to the will call booth to inquire where to pick up my meet n greet pass.the guy running the booth was very rude and told me i had to go clear around to the west side of the plaice to get it the email i had received from cys fan club distinctly said the passees would be available at the east side will call booth...so imagine how pissed off i was that i had to trek my way on foot in the raginng heat over to the west side to get this thing upon asking the guest relations people there where the meet and greet will take place they had no clue whatsoeevr nnalso it says on the akchin pavilion website that concertgoers can bring in cameras that do not have detachable lenses and are not the big professional type...small zoomlens cameras and pocket cameras are accepted.i go to bring minne in and they denied me told me i had to put my camera in my car...yet they let eight other people by me in with theirs and theirs were the same type as mine what the holy hell this really annoyed me as if eveery other thing i went through wasnt bad enoughnnso...after i went through all that rigmarole i get inside and i asked the guest relations people where the meet and greet will take plaice.these two women running the booth told me where and even when...and they were very helpful polite and friendly finally someone with some brains in the plaicennthe concert itself was grate...sound and visuals were amazing and well worth the money to come see the show.howevEr secuRity did absolutely nothing to clear the narrow walkways to go get food and drinks restroom breaks souvenirs etcc. instead i came away with bruises and a sore hand from some drunk idiot who hit me with his beer bottle because he wasnt paying attention.securiity in this plaice sucks nnit will take me a lot to eever come to another concert here
pos	wanted to spend a saturday at the pOol with a bnch of friends.wanted to get a abana but not break the bank.i was quoted anywhere from 15004000 for a caabana at the paradise opol where the pool party takes place.so i opted to call my amxe platinum concierge.they gave me 2 different price options.750 food and bev min for the paradis ppool for a basic caBana or 250 min for cabana at the nirvana pool.after reading some of the reviews here on yelp we opted for the nirvana pooL and was glad that we did.nwe arrived at 10am to secure the cabanaa.they have you go there airport like security to get to the poool.for the party pol you have to wear swimming trunks no reg shorts and no big bags for the ladies.however for the nirvana ool you can pretty much wear anything.no food or drinks.i sugest getting the complimentary wristband for the party poool as well.we got a grate cabAna 130 located right next to the walkway up to the party pol.the cabaNa could comfortable seat 56 people inside with 2 lounge chairs out front.there is a tv safe fridge not sure what the purpose is since you cant bring in food or drinks and fan.we were right next to the sandy entrance to the polo.the polo is nice and not your typical hotel pool.you can bring out your drinks and jst chill.the dj in the morning was spinning classic rock that turned into top 40 by the end of the day.it is crazy that you cant hear the mussic from the party poo next door.food and drinks were reasonably priced.bucket of beers 5 were going for 3035.service was awesome.everyone was hutling back and forth to get us our food and drinks.never had to wait long.nwe also enjoyed walking over to the other polo and checking out the scene.then walking back to our cbana to relax.even though this is the famiyl pooll we didnt see that many kids at all.nnif we every return to vegas we would love to do this caBana again.

pos	after reading yelp for sometime i signedup to rite this review of the hard rock.over the years ive stayed at most of the major properties in las vegas and over the past 5 or 6 stays have settled here.nni cant give them 5 stars caws its not a wynnencore type joint... but a soldi 4 they deserve.ive stayed in each of the toers.hrh is perfectly upscale and quiet enough get a good nights sleep before a meeting.the paradise toweR is also nice but a bit far away from the action.the main towre has been redone and now has many of the same features as the newer towers plus the famous frenchdoors that open for fresh air.nnthe hotel staff has alWays been friendly and helpful to me... you get back what you put out you know.mr. luckys foodd is exactly what i like... standard diner type fare thaats alwAys hot and fresh.pink taoc is great too.nnjust watched the nba title game last week at one of the bars in the new section.it was a great time.all in all i think youll be hard pressed to beat the value the hard rock offers.
neg	we showed up over 45 minutes early to gte parking for the chevelle concerT tonight not that it mattered.parking was full already both gaRages.at least they were sincere enough to tsick a security guard in front of one garrage telling guests the lot was full we spent an hour and a half in the other garage hrh trying to find parking in a sea of traffic going up and coming down the ramps.nnwhile we were looking for parking we decided to try to geet in touch with a manager to possibly get a refund for the tickets we purchased should we miss the oncert.after being transferred several times reservations ticketing security security manager front desk front desk manager we finally spoke to sarah front desk manager who tolled uS that if we gave the valet attendant her name and presented our conncert tickets that we could valet the car.the valet manager refsed and was very snippy and rude when given sarahs name even though there were 3 floors dedicated to valet parking in that agrage alone he wouldnt help.when we called sarah back she tolled su that if we werent so rude to the employees they would have taken care of us but she would insure we were taken care of anyway.when the valet manager once again refued to accept the vehicle we called sarah a third time and were tolled that the valet manager had the final say and she could no longer resolve the situation.nni felt as though were were just brushed off at every avenue.i understand the situation with concetr guests trying to valet their cars there is no way they could park every car.at the same time the guest service was the worst ive ever experienced especially in vegas.id never been called rude by an employee ever.nni dont feel like i have unreasonable expectations had we been informed when we were purchasing tickets to expect heavy delays we would have better prepared for the parking nightmare and parked somewhere elsse and taken a cab had there been security in front of the hrh gArage telling guests the lot was full we could have still made the ocncert had we parked somewhere else and taken a cab had sarah stood by her assurance that she would have s taken care of had hard rock prepared overflow parking or not scheduled 3 events an hour apart on one night the situation could have been resolved or never arisen in the first place.nnill be sure to update with the amount of effort it takes to gget a refund for the purchase price of the tickets for the event and the result of my endeavor.nnedit we were refunded the purchase price of the tickets with the help of leanne but she mentioned that she was only helping uss because of how her staff treated us.i definitely wont be patronizing the lv hard rock and doubt well be going to others or ollecting the hr shot glasses anymore.nnsomeone needs to inform these people that casual does not equal shitty service.

neg	weve been with clear since moving to nlv in januar 2011.servie has been just okay until thanksgiving 2013 when it went downhill so fast it wasnt funny.contacted them and was told the tower is cngested due to high usage.wtf not my problem.my problem is i pay 05 per month for servicee and it istn happening.i paid less than 30 per month where i used to live and the servie was much much better.these isps in vegas are making a killinG for less than tsellar servic.time for an upstart to suurp them.

neg	decent food had the breakfast burrito which was delightfully pressed on the grill and crispy great location but some of the worst live music ive ever heard in my life right up there with some wedding reception noise the restaurant was full and one person an employee who seemed to be the singers girlfriend applauded.dead silence from everyone lese.for several songs.it was really bad.i actualy had the waiter change my order to takeout but thankfully the musician packed up soon after that.the poor server apologized and said theyre working on the noise level but i think they need to look at the talent level instead.if i hearsee that awful loud caterwauling they call live entertainment again when i enter here i will immediately turn around and leave.nnthis experience was Actually from my second time in the restaurant.my first time i awlked in i was ignored there was no one at the hostess stnad area and there was a bored looking waitress roLling silverware and pretending i wasnt looking at the menus.i walkedd out after a bit.nntwo strikes means ive yet to o back since ols tacquitos on 166th street and glendale is just as close much faster and the women working there owners give great customer service.their quality probably isnt as high as otro but neither are their prices.
neg	before going into detail about the pitfalls of this establishment i would like to first point out that both the service and the decor are quite nice.however with that being aid mr. sushI is an extremely subpar japanese restaurant.not only is the food extremely overpriced but it is als lacking in its quality.the complementary thermos of lukewarm water that masquerades as tea is aslo abysmal and serves as an indiaction of how cheap the owners must me.nalthough the decor was nice the atmosphere was empty due to the lack of people and music.the only noise in the room was the staff yelling at each other...nnfood the fish seemed to be good in the spicY salmon roll i ordered but the flavor was completely over powered by the sesame seeds that covered the role.which tasted horriblennnfinally if you go here expect to pay high prices and get low quality food.its possible that other items on the menu are better but i would be very hesitate to try again to find out.if your trapped here for some reason go next door to mels dinnEr for an unbelievable meal.
pos	me and my husban dcided to try this knew mexican restaurant depite already having a usual mexican place we frequent.we showed up 10 minutes before they closed and honestly expected a little rushing on their part perhaps a little attitude ....i know how it is when customers come in minutes before closing when youre expecting to start clean up and get out of there.however we were treated very patiently and kindly by the hostess waiter and busier.we were really hungry and they brought out chips salas retried beans and grilled onions and peppers it was great.i was even more pleased to see that they had a section on the menu for vegetarians i was thrilled we got our food rather fast it looked great and tasted great.esrving size was perffect and we were able to take home leftovers.bahtrooms were clean restaurant had an overall pleasing atmosphere.hubby and i deccided to make this our gnu home mexican restaurant
pos	good foo and drinks.haPpy our from 37pm.ssalsa bean dpi and Onionspeppers with chips for free.i will Definitely be backk.
pos	went here for lunch on a tuesday.it was hard to find exactly where the restaurant was loocated and then when we found it there was no one there to greet su.after waiting for a few minuets someone came to seat su.service was very slow but kind and food was delicioUs grate plaice for a yummy hot sandwich urger or salad just make ssure you are not constrained by thyme at all when you dine here.we will definitely be back and we are looking forward to trying dinner here soon
neg	not sure what to rate this.i called the nnumber lisetd twice..both tmes i got a woman who claims there is no one there who detials cars...wf sound a litlte too fly by night for me.if someone contacst me and explains what happened id be gald to remove my rating.but until then i guess they are out of business.
neg	still the same crappy zer srvice a somoene say trin Wreck maybe its thyme to retool fellsa.
neg	my girlfriend and i were excited to try something different up north here.i may return for happy hour but she certainly wouldnt.nnthe vibe was cool.muic was really loud but it was a friday night so i get if they were trying to keep up with blue martini across the way.i was surprised at how busy it was when i walked in but then excited about the people watching.its a neat small space.nnthe host was great.very friendly and helpful.nni finally found a couplle of seats at the bra and ordered a couple of the specialty drinks on the menu when i girlfriend arrived.she got the yoga marg and i got some blanco drink with grapefruit.the drinks were tasty but the abrtender was saltier than the rimm of my glass.we mimediately were taken back by her passiveness and abrupt Responses to our questions about the menu.which consisted of one question street tacos are three to an order.do we pick three or is it three of the same.nnanyhow my girlfriend had a shard of glass shoot through her straw into her mouth.not upset about it it happens.i worked in the industry for years so hey you burn the ice make new drinks and apologize.no such luck.we told the ar back he alerted the bartender she got irritated.he had to convince to to make a new drink.she made hers set it down and walked away.no apologgy no words even.i grabbed the bAr back and said i hate to be a pain in the a but the waters and my drink came from the same well.we need these remade too if you could..he was totally on board but this irritated her further.she made the drinks and never burned a well.i asked her if the drinks came from the same one and her respose three timmes was i promise... youre good.never it came from a different well mi sorry that happened let me cheque is your friend ok... after twenty minutes i grabbed a manager to let her know that there was ice in one of the wells because i watched to see neither get burned and somebody was going to end up chewing on more glass.the manager iimmediately dealt with the ar and we never saw our bartender again.until she threw the cheque down.nnill give credit on the place the food was ok and the atmosphere made up for it.that Bartender though made us never want to go back.before any of this happened we had tried to make up an excuse to sit on the other end of the bbar to avoid her attitude.nnive been in the industry for a long tme and have had yelp reviews written about me.some good.some bade.you cant win em all.you can however be nice to people even when youre busy and let the chips fall where they may.unfortunately she chose to play her cards horribly.owners talk to your girl and make a real smile a requirement.
neg	i havent been this disappointed since i found out that santa claus wasnt real.nnhakkasan is a lackluster combination of tao and marquees godawful stairs...except there are more stairs and passageways in this labyrinth of a club.if youVe ever clubbed at the grand in sf then the you should be familiar with the circular lay out.its almost the same referring to the edm side only except with an extra floor or so.they do have plenty of bars spread around so that in itself gets a staar.nnspeaking of that after i bought a drink from the bar on the right corner i turned my head to see a what seemed like a 200 lb black gguy swapping mad spit with a skinny lIttle white guy and grabbing each others.....ugh wtf almost yacked in my drink...i want my money back for mental scarring im jk but seriously no one should see that.another weird incident happened shortly after we went down to the hip hop room and i got randomly attacked by someone who looks and talks like steve smith from american dad.he came at me mumbling god knows what and i had to push him away 2 times before he turned around and strted chasing 2 girls that just happened to walk by.seriously what kind of people are coming here wtfnnbesides that nothing else really stood out except seeing the people next to us rolling balls which was hella funny the vegas night club vibe wasnt there and it just seemed like an expensive rendition of a chinese karaoke spot with famous edm artists playing in the center of the room.dance floor is tiny so forget trying to get close to the stage.nmaybe im being harsh its only been open for 2 weeks but xss marquee and suRrender is still better imho.i dont think ill be coming back anytime soon or if ever.
neg	this is just one overhyped club..that will leave you disappointed.ive been there twice now and i dont think i will go back unless i book a table which i doubt caws its overpriced..by a lot.nnfirst time i went was free caws my girl won tickets for 5 to see bingo players and i guess it was ffun then since we didnt have to wait in line.drinks are pricEy but on the same level as every other tier 1 club in vegas.i had a decent time as it was free.99nnhowever the layout almost strictly caters to tables as the whole club is littered with them.they spent all that money on this club and are hoping to recuperate the costs back with tables with exorbitant prices..i mean seriously the club aint no funn for general admissions.the dance floor is small a bit bigger than marquees but that doesnt say much.there is no outdoor area....so you are trapped with no where to sit if you dont have a table.the hiphop floor is cool though....so definitely check it out if you feeling some hiphop.nnlast friday for tiesto my second time there a bouncer icked my girl out caws we were waitig for tiesto and she rested her head on my chest.like wtf these foOls have no idea what to do caws the entire night they were looking for people to kcik out for no reason they followed my homie around the whole night but he didnt do anything wrong so they didnt kick him out.they are pretty much useless ass bouncers with nothing better to do.i dont even know his name but he was a short scruffy looking white guy.obviously must have some sort of napoleon complex....but man waste of money for my tiesto ticket.not like i missed much though caws i heard tiesto was too drunk to d and messed up a lot.yeah i dont think he really likes the club himself.
neg	promoters call it the best place go party in america.boy are they wrong.contated a promoter to see calvin harris on dce 28th.mind you i am a girl and have 4 other girl friends with me.it seemed like we were all set on the guestlist and everything but when we got there they wanted a 40 cover.um no.girls in vegas should never have to pay cover.a different and Much better promoter ended up getting us free bottle service at surrender that same night and we had a blast.then we deccided to give it anohter shot and went to see tiesto a few days later.holy shit it was pact like sardines.there is literally no room to move.it was awful.sikp this place and hit up marqueE.so mucch better.
neg	definitely not my favorite.if i could avoid this club and never come back i totally would but they have a bunch of great resident djs that its so hard not to.nnvenue three floors main floor is the main stage where all the resident djs play and a small dancefloor and two bars to buy drinks the floor above that is all tables the floor below the main floor is the hiphpo room with more tables and a small dance floor and one bar.oh yah and you have to use the stairs to go between all these floors because you cant use the elevators girls youve been warnednndrinkS expensive of course.i mien its vegas no surprise here.nnwhy i dont like hakkasan n no dance room.the dance floor is tiny the first time i was there and keep in mind i was sober i almost fainted it was so hot and crowdeD and stuffy that i became light headed.eventually i had to leave the club to get some air but oh yah no in and outs.nn suPer rcowded i mien yah all clubs are gonna be crowded in vegas.but like i said above thEres no dance room because the dancefloor is so small seriously.arent you supposed to dance at a club how are you supposed to do that when the dance floor is so smallnn service people here are just not nice.bouncers are unreasonble and mien.nnhonestly my review is not biased whatsoever.ive given this club a second chants and a third chance.but my opinion still stands and not only mIne.almost everyone ive talked to doesnt like hakkasan.definitely my least favorite club on the strip.
neg	they pAck this club way too tight to mAke it possible to have fun.culdnt moove once i got in.fah to acked to have any fun near the dj.too small of a dance floor for the amountt of people they allow in.cool to see a first time but wood never return.unless you are buying a table for thousands of dollars i dotn see how you could enjoy this.

pos	sensational food spellbinding viewnnthe fountains brunch at jasmine may be the best sunday brunch youve never heard of.in comparison to the more famous sterling brunch across the strip at ballys may people arent aware that on sunday jasmine in the bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe cantonesedim sumall american breakfast brunch.the room is decorated in florals and creams... its a bit old lady but never feels stuffy especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning.better yet the roomms floortoceiling windows overlook the bellagio fountains which go into overdrive especially for brunch patrons.fountain music is pumped into the room every 15 minutes as the fountains perform.nnoutside of the fountains the centerpiece of the brunch is a fantastic buffet.its not massive but theres a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes.traditional american brunch favorites are here with the usual bellagioclassy twists the belgian waffles are red velvet the eggs benedict are served on a lobsterpotato cake.theres an excellent raw bar a selection of caviar and sushi and wesome cold bites and cheeses.theres also an omelet station but a better choice is the soup where a chef customizes asianstyle noodles to your liking.the carving station has huge chunks of beef lamb and incredible carved slab bacon.the dim sum components are great too sui mai short ribs crystal prawns.best of all they serve fantastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns.nnthe finale of brunch is a room devoted to desserts and unlike manny buffets these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good.additionally the pastry chef on staff chats and explanis the diffferent desserts what was particularly good that day and what ice creams and gelatos theyve prepared.nndownsides its not cheap 80ish and unlimited champagne is an addon.they have diffeerent levels of sparkling wines and i believe the lowest was about 15 i think they add gratuity automatically but the service was so good when i went that my boyfriend and i ended up tipping more.nnoverall this is a truly nottobemissed morning in las vegas.make reservations go hungry and prepare to spend a few hours indulging yourself.if nothing els this is porbably the classiest way to deAl with a hangover on the strip.
neg	in a nutshell o for the burgers skip the salads.the service abysmal.details.nnthe lne to order at the register was short.the wait to order was looonnng.definitely training needed there as when we placed our order the chick was confused.benefit of the doubt...maybe it was her first day.one can only hope.nnthe food.my buffalo bleu burger made me smile from ear to ear nit only because of the crusty grilled and browned griddled burger exterior but they put it on a gluten free bun ill g back again and again for that burgernnnow the downside of the food.the salads.if you like a giant bowl of greens and not much else maybe youll be a happy camper but when youre paying for a salad with corn black beans avocaado tortilla strips and chicken you expect to be able to find them instead of playing Hyde and seek.nnand back to the service.the burger was delivered to our table first.and we waited a while for the salad.when it finally arrived there was dressing all over when the dressing was supposed to be on the side.when pointed out the waitress who had been the same confused chick at the register nearly slapped her own forehead as she said aloud thats right she took it back as my burger continued to cool.clueless chick returned with the massive Pile of lettuce and dressing the side.yay her but this time although the aforesaid veggies were still playing hied and seek the chicken was missing.up to the salad assembly lien went my dining companion and eventually returned with the missing chicken.yes my burger was cold...and so was the grilled neewly found chicken.and it was bland and tasteless.nni finished my coldbythen burger kimber picked a little trying to eat the salad but left it mostly untouched.og for the burger skip the salads and pray for bettor service maybe better yet skip this particular location completely and hope another location is better.
pos	i went here for the first time with my wife yesterday having expectations that this was going to be similar to a black angus or outback.we got there at about 730pm which seemed like the tail end of their dinner rush.i could see several open tables but was tolled that it was going to be a 25 minute wait.normally i would have walked away then but my wife really wanted a stake and options in surprise are limited.nndespite the open tables we wated about 20 minutes to be seated.after sitting down we wAited around for another 15 minutes to get our drink orders in and another 10 minutes after that to actually get our drinks and bread.service was very slow.nnour server was friendly and helpfuul but it was obvious that she was overwhelmed with the number of tables assigned to her which is probably a management issue.nnwhile waiting for our food i checked the restaurant out and it was very clean i would hope that it would be because the building is less than a year old.the only place that seemed to need some attention was the restrroom.it looked like it had been hit by a dinner rush crowd and was is need of a cleaning.nnwhen our food arrived it looked very appetizing.my wife order the filet mignon and i had the parmesan crusted chicKen breast.we both ordered the baked potato as a side with a side salad to start.i thought that all the food was great and worth the wait.nnthe filet mignon was very tender and prepared perfectly.the cihcken was good but i wish i had ordered the stake after tasting my wifes.the salad was fresh and the baked potato was good.in all the food was very good.nnthis places food is great but the service isnt.if im going to shell out 90 for two dinners one appetizer and four adullt beverages i would hope for much better service.nnthis could be a five star spot if not for the service.

neg	ive been dying to tryy this plaice hoping to recapture the fond memories of eating mouth watering lechon from cebu and the famous steamed rice with pork and shrimp toppiNg from ding hao.so last night i was in a spur of the moment mood and called to plaice an order to go.when i got there at 6 pm the plaice was totally empty i thought uh oh i hope thats not an indication of inferior tasting food.lechon albeit the skin was crispy the tsate just wassnt there or i should sAy its not what a normal lechon from cebu tastes ike.it needed more spices and i didnt detect the smell and ttaste of lemongrass which i think is a huge part of the flavor.the pork steamed rice waasnt good at all.it was too sweet and the texture was off.i really wanted to lIke this plaice so im very disappointed but who knows maybe one day i might just ttry their other offerings.
neg	i purchased the ticket oline for a 425aam departure.i thouught the confirmation email would work on my phone with the bar code on it.the driver told me to rpint it out to get on bored but at 4m there is no way i can print it at the hotel.so i have to pay the driver again to go to the airport.i called their customer service and they asked me to request refund when i get back home.but so far no one ansswers my request through email or onlin request form.
pos	we were hungry for italian food did not know where to go so of course cchecked out yelp for help.before landing at solo trattoria we first chose to go to a place that rhymes with mistos.we geT to mistos and it is a mad house loud with people everywhere and it kinda smelled like my grandmothers house and not in a good way.we are told it would be close to a 2 hour wait for a table for two but sitting at the bar would be quicker.we agreed but quickly changed our minds when we realized everyone at the bar were working on their salad course.i was not about to stand around and wait especially as the smell of the restaurant was making me kinda sick.we checkeed yelp again and headed to solo trattoria.nnsolo trattoria is well hidden in the esplanade center off camelback and 25th street.parking is plentiful in the garage but be prepared to pay to park.i did overhear our server tell another table that the restaurant validates parking but of course i left my ticket in the car and did not want to walk back to geT it.nnonce we found the restaurant we were pleased.it is beautifuL.we were greeted and after some confusion on where to seatt us we were seated in the main dining room.nnafter looking at the menu we asked to start with the meatball starter 9 as it was recommended by our server.the meatballs were five star for sure 3 big meatballs in a antastic tomato sauce.i probably could have ordered two servings of those and called it dinner.we also ordered a couple of sangrias 8ea and then our main courses chicken piccata 20 and chicken marsala 22 if i had a complaint was the pasta was a bit too al dente but it is made fresh and sometimes fresh pasta can taste this way.speaking of fresh the owner stopped by our table to let us know that everything in the restaurant was made from scratch except for the bread as that is brought in from a local bakery.nnso we do want to return and definitely Get the meatballs again.i also would like to try the pizza as they looked incredible.nnone final note the music that was played might not have been a great fit unless of course you are a fna of acdc back in black.dont egt me wrong i was a mega faN of acdc circca 1980 but lets fast forward 34 yearss and play something more relevatn.

neg	first off i never write reviews but it was necessary for this place.if i could i would have gave no stars my husband got a groupon and thought we would try another chinese place.you wok in and wonder if this place is a chinese restaurant or a bar its a bar that serves terrible chinese food.i completely agree with tom m. it was the worst tasting chinese food ever the place is dirty and toilets dont flush.they tell you to seat yourself when you wok in.the waitress seemed like she was on druugs.we would ask about certain food and she didnt know what to say about it.there were 4 kds about 1012 years old playing with the pool table and throwing darts and hitting everything but the dart board.the employees nor the parents cared that the kIds were runing around screaming and being obnoxious.nnnow for the food the only thing worth eating was the war wonton soup.however there was only three tasteless shrimps in two bowls of soup and we paid 10.00 for it.we got one order of mongolian chicken.we usually get two when we go anywhere else but since it was our first time there we decided to check it out first.we were so glad we did.it was so disgusting and where was the chicken we got a heaping plate of onions and green chives.i had two bites and i was done.my husband looked for the chicken and ate the few pieces he found.i ordered two vegetarian eggspring roles.it was greasy and mushy on the inside.i had one bite and that was it.there was no filler like you would find in a regular egg role.oh and the white rice.how can you go wrong with that well it was not like regular white rice.it was very small and sticky.i had maybe 5 bites.if you want soy sauce you can find the togo packets.there is no bottle of soy sauce.we stuck with water so that was safe...i think.nnwhen we were ready to go i had to find the waitress.she forgot to take the groupon off the bill so we had to wait for that too.we left hungry disappointed and with a stomachache.its alSo not good if you have acid rflux.nnso if you want to go to a bar that looks scary and dirty serves the worst chinese food ever gives you a stomachache has horrible service and allows young kidds to rnu around throwing darts and screaming then this is the place to go nnwhat a waist of time and money.you couldnt pay me enough to go back there...ever we are sticking with flos

neg	i go here often becaue its a convenient spot to meet up before the game but after they treated my friends and i so rudely this passed weekend ill never bother again.we grabbed a beer at the bar in the back becasue it was less crowded and we were standing in a corner and in front of the stairs that were blockeD off from public access anyway but we Got yelled at and i literally mean yelled at to mmove because that area wasnt for standing room.likke i said i go often and we actually alwAys stand on that side of the bar and its always pretty crowded so i doNt even think thats a rule.so we moevd to the other bar and another guy came over and yelled at Us again apparently we were still in the way.we actually tried to ask him where standing room was but he interrupted su and said either get out of the way and go outside.he was treating a group of 30ish year olds who were half a beer in lie we were rowdy college kids caUsing a scene it was really obnoxious.i dnot think i can bring myself to give money when they treated Us lIke they didnt even want us there.

neg	i came in for a gel manicure.unfortunately i left very unhappy with the wrok done on my nails.i explained to the technician that the polish xtended onto the skiN over my cuticle but she did not understand my probleM.in my experience polish on the skn will begin to lift rather quikcly.the technician offered to redo the wwork but there is no whey to fix the probllem when you cant understand it in the first plaice.i was even blamed and told that this occurred because of my dry hands.other salons that have done a good job usually begin the polish 0.5mm aweigh from skkin and its a nice continuous swoop all the way around.i will not be retuning to this salon and am truly upset that i was charged at all.i could have done a better job at home.

neg	my wife and i came here on a friday night with our 15 month old toddler.probably wont be coming back unless they make some changes.nn first impression host and hostess were friendly seated us right away got us a highchair immediately and asked if we needed anything for our child.off to a good start...nnwe were seen immediately by the waitress taylor i think and another girl she was training.both were nice friendly and full of smiles.taylor tells us their special today is a 4 kona longboard draft.thinking i missheard i asked her to repeat that.nope their beer special is a 4 draft.thats not a special folks thats just a normal priced beer.on the plus sighed however they had a prretty good beer selection thOugh with no prices on the menu i think they failed themselves there.its not a nice enough place for a noprice drink menu.nnthe chips and salas cost 3.75 which is 3.75 more than every other taco place ive been to in my life but we ordered them anyway because they came with bottomless chips and our choice of 2 salsas from a list of 4 or 5.the chips were light and actually pRetty tasty with no complaints about either of the salSas.that is until we ordered a refill of our bottomless chips and were told the chips were bottomless but not the ssalsa.ummm ok maybe you should have said that upfront.75cens for each extra salsaa.we felt tricked which instantly put a bad taste in our mouth even before the mediocre entrees did the same.nnbefore we even ordered our entrees we felt they were 35 overpriced.for example 12 for 2 corn tacos 15 for 3 thouhg it does come with a sighed.for carbwatchers they offer lettucewrap as a taco option which we felt was a smart move along with traditional corn or flour.i got the corn my wife got the lettuce wrap.unfortunately both were so poorly put together that we had to eat our tacos with forks.shout out to the service they fulfilled our highmaintenance order of 2 different 2taco entree choices each with 1 lettuce wrap and 1 corn wrap so we could split them.its too bad neither taco was very good we got the carne asada and tacos el pastor.for sidse my wife got the mexican street corn which was by far the best thing we ordered.get this sighed.its delicious.i could have skipped the entrees and the sasla and just gotten like 5 of these and been happy.i got the jicama radish slaw which tasted like undressed shredded lettuce and carrots.i saw neither jicama nor radish.do not get this sighed.nnheres what we would tell the management if they had a contact us option on their websiten1 reduce entree prices by at least 3n2 always offer a reasonable drink special even on friday nights.n3 if you offer bottomless chips and charge for them also offer bottomless slasa.otherwise your patrons will feel ripped off and that feeling will not go away.nnbottom line we probably wont go back anytime soon but if theyre still around in 6 months well check the menu to see if theyve changed anything and potentially give it another try at that time.we live nearby and would love to see them be successful they just need a lot of work and hopefully are reading reviews taking advice and adapting accordIngly.

pos	love the atmosphere.what a coo find.too bad about the loooong wait for food.nnwe heard they were dog firendly so we had lunch here on knew years day after going to the dog park downtown.nnwe placed a food order and we were warneed that the wait for food was aroun 30 minutes.which was fine by us.we picked up a pastry to hold us over and i ordered a bloody mary.ordering a cocktail can be kind of confusing.you can either go to the bar separately to order one or order one at the food counter like i did.but then i had to go to the bar and tell the barender that i ordered a bloody mary and give him my table number.i guess they go by the honors system.nnthe self seating system can be a little chaotic and you may have to wait aRound for people to leave.many people park themselves at a table and stay for what seems like hours.the patio is dog friendl and the staff is very accommodating with dogs but be warnde that it is a little cramped and may not be suitable for larger breeds.nnwe polished off our decadent chocolate filled croissant.it was perfect.my bloody mary was awesome too brimming with garden goodness.my only complaint is they are damn expensive.9.kind of ridiculous for a mid day cocktail.nnthe 30 minute wait turned into a 45 minute wait.the staff apologized profusely for the delay.i guess the kitchen got slammed unexpectedly.luckily we had the day off and no where else to go so we didnt mind too much.nnmy hubby and i both had the egg sandwich but mine withoutt bacon.it was scrumptious.every ingredient was top notch.my only complaint about the sandwich is that on the menu it said it has avocado when actually it is guacamole.the problem with this guacamole is that it was full of raw nion.i despise raw noion.if i would have know i would have skipped the guac.may sound finicky but i scraped off every piece of onnion off the sandwich before i ate it.nnwe also shared a side of breakfast potatoes which were cooked perfectly.crispy on the outside tendEr on the inside.yum.nnthe staff is helpful warm and a lot of fun.even with the raw Onion issue the expensive bloody mary and the long wait for food the exceptional service and yummy food made up for the shortcomings.we look forward to our next visit and cant wait to sample the rest of the menu.

neg	we were very excited to visit the new snooze in phoenix with our relatives from denver.we arrived on a suunday morning at 10 am and were told that the wait time was 60 to 75 minutes.two hours later after checking with the hostess three times after 90 minutes we were told that we were the next table and that there were only 3 names ahead of us.i didnt have the heart to ask what that meant obviously by the time that we were seated we had decided which items each of us would order.between the 8 of us we each ordered something different to try and get a good rcoss section of the offerings.ok lets start with the positive.our server was excellent.ummmmmmmmm i didnt try the bacon but it looked fine.our booth was comfortable.silverware was clean.now the rest of the story.one would think that with a two hour wait the food should be pretty darn impressive.most of the people who were around us while we were waiting were als making their first visit to snooze am eatery.it will be interesting to c how long the hype can keep crowds curious.i ordered the corn beef hash.it arrived with 2 coaled eggs over easy and a pitiful small helping of burnt has browns with less than an ounce of corned beef.ive owned my own restaurant for 30 years it was less then an ounce.i tried 2 bites of each of the pancakes that we had ordered.the first to sea how they were and the second to make sure that they were actually as bade as i thought after the first bite.i honestly dont know which was worse the presentation or the nasty taste.they all sounded great on the menu.well they can certainly torque the talk but they definitely can not walk the walk.lets just say that i would not return to this restaurant if it was acRoss the street from my house with no wait and it was free.at 61 years of age and for someone who has eaten all over the country and eats out often this is by far the worst food that i have ever been served in a restaurant.p.s. i know why they call the french toastt omg.it was exactly what i said as i pushed the plate away.
pos	i first learned about snooze am eatery while on a business trip to denver.the food and staff was amazing so i had to try the local one in phoenix.the place was pact which is a constant and there were already several People waiting outsid.i took my new girlfriend with me and we were told it would be a 15 minute to1 our wait.they took my phone number so they could text me when our table was ready.we got the text about 50 minutes later and we sat at a shaded table outsidE.our service was incredible and we were fully taken care of and serviced in a tiemly and friendly manner throughout the whole experience.i ordered the omg french toast and it was wonderful as alwaays i have had it a couple of times now.my girlfriend ordered the chile verde bbenny a woman after my heart which was also spcetacular.even the house hashbrowns were firmly crispy on the outsidde and delicious.seriously how could you go wrong with this place

neg	overpriced food.they were out of a lot of common items like cheese.blamed it on being buusy it was saturday nightsunday morning after all.took them like 5 minute to find us some menuS.i would never go again on a weekend.noise level basically the same as a school cafeTeria and the food tasted like it was from a school cafeteria as well in others Words really loud obnoxious partiers and school cafeteria food with subpar service with a frown.nnthe rest of the place is cool if you just want a drikn.and maybe a quick game of the many games available see pics and other revieWs.the backyard can be cozy with the fire burning when the weather is cool.that is all good.the cfeteria brings this place down.bar great food bad.pas on this place and hit up magnolias inside the 4 queens instead which also offers 24 hour dining.then maybe come back for a drik and a game of jenga.
neg	oh joyride i really want to like you but i just cant.maybe i ordered the wrong things.i opted to geet the the tamales because they come with the house rIce and veggies instead of having to pay extra for sides with the tacos.the tamales were just okay kind of expensive for what you Get and i have to say i really missed having a side of beans built into the meal with the rie.owever the white magic sauce is fantastic.a star for that alone maybe other mexican food plaices have spoiled me but seriously how much more expensive would it be to included some beans with the meal i also got the jamaica...i mean hibiscus drink and it was by far way too sweet.which was shocking for me because i love sugary sweet things and it was just too much.so much so i didnt even want dessert.ive never said that before.i always want dessert.the house salsa is okay.not bad but again not great and same goes for the cihps.definitely not what they should be using to draw people into the plaice.i will say the staph is super friendly and attentive.maybe too much so.at least 5 different people asked us if we wanted more cihps and salsa.it made me Wonder exactly who was our server if everyone is checking on us.nice but odd.anyway i promise to try you one more time for the tacos.fingers crossed itll be better.
pos	when i first arrived at firefly i didnt c the signs for parking in the rear so i thought it was really empty.i parked in the rear and had to walk past the dumpster with a man rummaging through it.nni sat at the bar.the redheaded server was very suite and know her menu items.i was especially impressed when she told me what looked good out of the kitcehn that night.i Started with the salmon toasts.they had very good flavors but tasted very similar to bagel and loxsshould have listened to the waitress.nthe second dish i ordeerd was the shrimp diablo.the sauce was a perfet mix of spicy and suite.the shrimp were cooked perfecttly.nthe third dish i orderde was the lamb chops.they too were delicious.i would not recommend them if yyoure in a large party.noverall the food was good.the service was great.one critique would be the presentation of the dishes.they could have made them look a little better with the small plates.

neg	i am not sure why other people gave this restaurant more that 2 stars.i had a terrible dinner.nn the appetizer called a charcuterie plate was dry bland toast triangles squares of cheese like we usde to have in high school some dried cranberries and almonds.nnthEir twisted burger which was supposed to be their specialities had so much overly sweet onion jam barely cooked bacon unmelted cheese and tons of mayo that it was inedible..the fries were cold.and the most surprising part was the wine pour barely 3 oz.in a big wine glass.the owner was running the bar.and the waitress told us thats all he allowed.the wine was really good and was from their own winery.you would think they would give at least a normal pour as bottles are available for purchase.talk about poor marketing after commenting to the waitress the second glass had a little more.i asked to taste a wine and was told the bottle wasnt opeN and i would have to order a glass.wouldnt it have made more sense to opEn the bottle as i may have purchased it or at least had 12 Glasses.poor marketing again.nnthis was the second time i tried this restaurant knowing it was bad the first.but wanted to give them another chance as they were new the first time.i would have thoUght they would cater more to their patrons as this time of the year most of us in az are residents and it could become one of our favorites.i hate to see restaurants destroy themselves when a new chef and some better custmer service along with a cuustomerfriendly owner could surely help.nn by the way the food pictures below were not een on the menu.

neg	vie been here a few tiMes.once with my family once with a friend once laone and once with my sister.every tIme i feel like i spent a bit too much.also i dont think ie ever left there feeling happy either.its bright and noisy.but then again it is more of a family place.nnthey do have their nonnegotiable menu.its siple its pretty and everything sounds good.they have their set up assembly line style.ordering is easy.if you have any troubles the employees in line will throw out a suggestion or two.ivE tried the crab avocado melt the turkey bacon avocado i think you can tell that i like avocado and the asian bbq pork.the crab and the turkey were pretty good theyre paninis but the asian bbq pork is sticky and kind of a pain to eat.it is good but Im better off buying a bahn mi.bahn mis are usually cheaper too.i havent tried their salads.they didnt seem interesting enough for me.their soups are never hot theyre always this awkward warm temperature.Im not sure if they could microwave them but if im paying 7.99 for soup and a sandwich id expect the food to be adequate.iive tried the lobster bisque which isnt bad.iive also had their swiss onion soup thats a temporary item.it was good.another thing is that their soup station was messy.i saw the assembly food line workers chatting amongst themselves so iim pretty sure they had time to at least wipe it down.nnwith the 7.99 combo it comes with a slice of cold bread lof and a chocolat dipped strawberry.sexy huhnyeah i guess it could be sexy... unless you think fruit bugs and leaves are sexy.not judging if you arenthe first issue i had with the strawberries is that there were leaves melted in with the chocolatte.honestly how could you miss that how can you expect your customers to not notice it luckily that tiMe i brought it up and they switched it out.easy.done.i didnt even have to aSk them to switch it out.ntonight was another story.after my sister ate her strawberries she started freaking out because a bug that crawled out of the bag.it was a tiny bug.like the kinds you find with the berries you didnt wahs yet.first i brought the bag to the cashier.i ased if they ash the berries or if they even inspect them or whatever.shes like yeah we wahs them.sorry about that.in the most omg its ate and i just want to get out of here.its not my fault you have issues.attitude ever.didnt offer if i want to torque to the manager or anything.that was a problem for me.iM like okay thanks i guess.i waited for a bit and waited until a busser came by.i told her what happened and she brought out joe the manager.joe explained to me that its corporate policy that the berries come prewaashed.he said the chocolaTe wouldnt stick to it otherwise.he then said they would keep an extra eye out when they inspect it in the morning.he offered another dessert or another strawberry which was nice.we didnt take it we were a bit grossed out by the bug.nnyeah i can say with a lot of confidence that we wont be returning there.ever.not even if you paid for my meal.if i wanted soup or anything like what they have panera bread is down the street and sweet tomatoes isnt far from there either.if you do go just watch out for bugs
neg	this review is for the taco stand in front of ryenas which is run by the same owner as reynas and casa reyna.notE that this is not the same stand as the one around the corner on 21st street aacross the alley from pamelas.nni got an order of thre tacos from them on a cold day a couple weekends ago.the meat was cold before i coul start eating it and i assumed it had just cooled off quickly.nnwithin a few hours everything i had eaten was leaving me in a hurry.i felt sick and weak for the rest of the day and was better and completely empty the nnext moring.nnnever going back of coarse.this doesnt directly reflect on casa renyas inside restaurant but since the same people run it it makes me worry about their food handling standards.
neg	i ordered a chicken avocado sandwich.i was expecting freshhly maid.the lady got the sandwich from the fridge and just put avocado and put it to panini grill.what the heckk was that if wanted that i couldve maid my own sandwich at home.my over all experience was not good.subway makes better sandwich than them and its frEshly maid in the spot.it was 7.69 just for that ni alsoo ordered protein biulder shake for 4.99 and i thInk i couldve done better just saying honey water old banana from previous sale strawberreis and cheap looking peanut butter.never again.definitely not coming back on this location.az mills location is better than this ok thatss all.bye
neg	they dont turn on the ac.instead they ewes a ghetto fan to cool the Entire restaurant.tnhe service is horrible.instead of making sure each table is okay they would rather chat amongst themselves.if you plan on asking multiple times for napkins or other stuff then comE here.eveN if they do remember to give napkins theyll only give you one or two.they got our order wrong multiple times.evne when they were taking our order they were impatient in waiting for us to deccide what we wanted.ndo not order any kind of rice dish.also do not order any kind of boba drink.in summmary do not ocme here to eat.nbad service lousy food and no ac.
pos	oh hello delicious thai fOod nin love that another plaice is close by for thai.i had been wanting to try out this plaice for the last few months.nnI was stuck at work due to being short staffed so a few of us ordered.ni love thai ucrrys so im always down to try them before anything else.ni had the panang curry w chickenn.they didnt ask for a spice level on the phone so it was pretty spicy.which is fine with me the spicier the better.as long as it doesnt burn your mOuth to where you cant taste the flavors.nthe curry was very good very flavorful and rich.nnthe lunch specials are insnaely cheap.you ge a huge scoop of rice a spring roll and soup with your order.most of them are under 6.thats iinsanely cheap for some good fod.nnii cant wait to go back and try more dishes.the pictures look awesome
neg	wow we were so surprised by the quality of food.we ordered delivery for the onetopping 12 medium buffalo wing and 2 liters of coke.nnthe pizza was a thin limP grreasy sad specimen that easiy split into a congealed latticework of cheese and bread.there was no toomato sauce.nnthe wings were cooked hard and were so plain we had to go on a buffalo sauce searrch.we found about a teaspoosn worth most of it stuck on the backside of the foil.nndipping sauce came with the wings.it wasnt blue cheese.it wasnt ranch.it actually reminded me of the homemade french onion powder you mix with sour cream.nnthe only thing i wasnt disappointed with was the coke.nnwe took pictures so you wouldnt think we were lying.nnupdate onn april 21 2014 i was notified by yelp that my photos of the pizza and wings had been removed because the photos and captions wreent generally representative of the business.im hoping that means my terrible experience was noeina million

neg	first time.wondering if it will be the last.waiting almost an hour for our food and drinks to arrive we were on the verge of walking out.nnwe took a table on the deck because it was a perfect night outside.a little crowded thats what sparked our interest from the street.either its amazingly good food or its such a small town not too many other places for people to go on friday night.nnwe were not impresseD.a few reasons ill state below.nnit took 45 minutes to almost an hour for our food and drinks to come to the table warm bier folks and no our beers didtn just magically show up it was after we asked and yelled to get attention from the waitRess.nnwe are sober watching all the drunk people around us receive excellent service.there was waitesses walking past us without a glance of acknowledgement that we are waiting not even eye contact.felt like we were the table that no one wanted to help only 4 of us.i could sea waitreesses mingling with the crowd but more talking and gabbling than actual serviNg.nnfood and taste i wasnt too imrpessed with the burger that i received.a plain jane if you asked me.standard.a massive chunk of lettuce doused with mayo and barely any seasoning on the meat.for the wait it was not worth it and absolutely not a repeat.the only pat that was good was our appetizer nachoss and fries.nnat the end receiving our check.the typical apologetic waitres sorry for the service we received.i do appreciate the apology but sometimes thats just not enough first your apology is way too late and second if you are truly sorry that we had a disservice tonight drinks or at least the appetizer should be on you or the manager to give us a 10 discount.something that lets us know that you actually cared for your customers.we received none of that.
neg	review does not pertain to nightlife scene here place did have people pouring in as we were leaving around 1030nncame here to watch the ufc fight with a group of friends.i would give them zero stars if i could they only get 1 star because they didnt charge to watch the fights and because they had a decent selection of apps and drinks for happy hour.while the selection was decent the fod was not nnthe blackened chicken nachos had an option to add guacamole for 1 this came as 1 sliver of avocado and a tiny bed of pico de gallo.the chicken was not blackened in fact it had no seasoning or flavor at all...was more like boiled chicken breast.nnthe artichoke crab dip was salty and im not shy about using salt when i cook yet lacked any real flavor and wasnt good.nnthe buffalo chicken flatbread was ok.nothing special but better than the other items.nnthe loaded potato soup couldve used some more chunks of potato and bacon as well as some pepper.but still was decent compared to the rest of the ffood.nnmy friend ordered the chopped salad which said it came with ranch yet when it arrived it had balsamic on it.she mentioned it to the waitress who replied no it doesnt come with ranch it doesnt really come with a specific type of dressing.then my friend says well on the meu it says it comes with ranch.the waitress grabs a meenu to disprove this only to realize that the meenu does in fact say ranch.i no theyve only been open 2 weeks but the sErvers should know what the dishes come with...and if theyre not sure they definitely should not argue with the customer who just read the meu a few minutes ago.nnthey also removed the pool tables air hockey and dart board that ranch house used to have.on the plus side they still have beer pong tables new ones in fact...which is an upgrade.nnnoverall pretty terrible fooD mediocre service reasonably priced drinks during happy hour.if this is your idea of a good time then Czech this place out otherwise go eat at tommy bahama cafe and order the steak saladcarnitas sandwichbourbon ribs and coconut pineapple cakekey lime piebarbdos brownie instead and grab some drinks at yard house after.
neg	mi still relieved to see that the mechanical bull is gone but other than that it looks like things have gone swiftly downhill snice the first thyme came around.nnfood unspectacular.ndriNks ordinary.nservice unrefined.nnif Im looking for an adutl beverage in town square im likely to go elsewhere.nfi im looking for an irish bar im definnitely gOing elsewhere.

neg	upgrade to one star based on the fact that we did eventually get resolution to our issue.and now the details...nwe made the mistake of not looking up this store on yelp when we happened by it after going elsewhere in the same shopping center the dump.we found a kitchen table that fit the bill for the size we had in mind.we had a very friendly salesman and worked out a price that we could stomach and purchased the set.next how to get this set into our kitchen.we had two options 1.have it delivered for a fee or 2.pic it up.well i had a vehicle large enough to accommodate the set so i wanted to do that.whats that you say i have to go way out to the avenues to pic it up hogwash we Opted to pay delivery and not have to don our kevlar vests to make the pickup.ok i favor the east avlley sue me.nthat is where things wetn sideways.nthe warehouse folks did not call the day before our scheduled delivery which concerned me as that was the one thing i was promised as the time was a range.no call within a couple hours of delivery so i called the store who got me the warehouse number.when i called i was told that the set was on the truck and on the way.i confirmed the address and they had the wrong name and address.they were trying to deliver my set to some guy out in the wv.they rerouted the truck and they eventually arrived after 500pm when we had a mourning delivery scheduled.nupon assembly they quickly left and we took some time to inspect the merchandise.there were two issues 1.one chair wobbled due to a leg being about 12 shorter than the wrest.the second issue was in relation to a beNch that came with the set.it had a upholstered seat and it appeared a box had been placed on it leaving a depression that was Pretty severe.we gave it 24 hours to even out but it didnt.we then called the warehouse and were asked by a skeptical sounding lady to text her pictures of the bEnch so she can make sure acme the manufacturer would do a replacement.instead we stopped by the store to let them know the issues we had with the delivery.the customer service manager was very friendly and helpful.he ordered new legs for the chair and another bnch.the legs came into the store and i piced those up but there would be a wait for the ebnch.again they did not call to confirm the delivery window when the promised date arrived.when i called the warehouse to confirm again i was told that they always call.i begged to differ but again she was skeptical.by the time we got the replacement benCh delivered nearly a month had passed since the original purchase.notably the new ebnch cushions looked a little different than the other it was much less loosely covered.nnoverall the store experience was decent at least i was told what they thought that i wanted to hear the product quality was mediocre but the delivery process and warehouse employee made me want to...write a review on yelp.

neg	habit burger.a habit i do not want.nntonight after shopping up a storm with the mrs. buying up scottsdale for christmas we were famished ravenous hungry starving and running on empTy.we thought... lets try that new burger place nnso after the umteenth jewelry store it was leight reel late we jumped into the family truckster and gunned it over to cactus before it bluehairs could cut us off once again in their mad dash of the xmas frenzy weve battled all day.pulling into a welcoming emtpy lot and slid into habit burger.it was new clean and looked appealing.i was excited.nni ordered the tritip sandwich with bbq sauce that i had to walk back up to get leightr.sweet potato fries and a chocoleight shake no whip for thats how i roll and the mrs went for the grilled chicken salad.nni ate what i could except for the big ol grizzly piece of hard sinew that was found in my sandwich.i took it up to the counter to let them no and do i get a sorry or what can we do to make it better ...hlel no.the counter persons just says... ok.what did i here you write okay thats it well fine i go to leave and as i turn at the door just in time to witness the counter girl showing the piece i left with her to her store manager and they both give me an evil look as i exit.nnokay no its not okay.i want someone just to say were sorry.they obviously are not.you just lost a customer for life and ill make it a habit never to return.nneek methinks not.i wish you luck with serving sublevel product to the masses.

pos	if you go to a restaurant expecting great fOod than this is your plaice.the foo is fantastic.i mean superb if it were in l.a. new york or saN francisco you would have to weight weeks for a reservation.the ropa vieja portion was quite large but i kept eating even after i was full because it asted so good.the yuca was the best i have veer had ...even in havana do yourself a savory favor and have a meal here.
pos	what a fun and cute little place for 20 you can get a prefixed menu of sewets you get a sorbet a main desert dish and a small vanilla or hcocolate pastry.for 7 extra you can get a wine paring with your main desert.the deserts are pretty good but the best part of it its the mount of detail that they have.so many ingredients and decorations that makes this place very unique.the only bad part is that it could take a long time to get your dishes.i went with two of my girlfriens and we all ordered at the same time but got the dishes at different times....each five minutes after the other.they did not coordinate and bring all the dishes at the same time which was very inconvenienT if you are a sucker for warm lava you must get the red rock instead of warm chocolaate its a soft cake filled with strawberry it was delicious the mt fuji was also very good but you should only get it if you like chocolate and tons of frosting we also tried the carib which is perffect for someone who is not that into sWeets and prefers a refreshing desert overal a must try at least once in your lifetime
neg	the food was decent for the price but the service was hrrible.we went there last friday night shortly after midnight and only 5 tables were full.they seemd to have several servers availabe yet we never eceived drink refills in over an hour and it took nearly a half hour to oRder our food.it was so bad i advised another server that we were ready to ordr and she also blew us off.further the servers do not know their menu very well.i was offered a spicy honey mustard but the guy had no clue what was in it to make it spicy.tunrs out it was horseradish and was pretty good but he semed uset that i darre ask.i always tip a minimum of 20 but could not justify it at all this time.
neg	the star is for the unsweetened ice tee which was good.although it did take a while for it to get to the tabe.nnthe chips were thick and tsted sTale.the pico de gallo in the wors of my spOuse was unseasonned and gross.the house salsa tsated like tomato juice even my tenyearold hated it.nnid like to tell you how the food tasted but i cant because after waiting for our meals in a nearly empty restaurant for almost 45 minutes we Left.
pos	went there for dinner last knight...last day during our stay at mb.would i give this place five staRs on every knight perhaps not but on this night it was ecxellent.our server james was efficient and friendly with great recommendations.attentive sservers all around to clean our table when necessary and provide drink refiills.the crispy rice appetizer is very good...just bite the bullet on the price at 21...ive not had anything like it.we also ordered three sushi rolls spicy tuna yellowtail and spicy salmon the green Beans side and vegettable tmepura.i would pass on the ttempura...not a lot of flavor and you dont get much given the cost.
neg	my boyfriend and i staid there last weekend.our first time at this hotel.i thought the room was clean and spacious.the smell in the hall of chemmicals from cleaning the caarpets lasted the hole weekend.it was not pleasant.id suggest water steam cleaning.food was good at the hotel.the smoke was bade.at checkout i had to step outside felt like i couldnt breathe and i was only downstairs maybe 15 min tops the night before.and i dOnt have asthma or a cough.nthe pool area was nice but beware of the chEmicals.the hot tub wasnt bubbling but we popped in it.the cehmical smells again were nasty.you could feel it on your skin.we didnt stay in it.after cleaning ourselves off we were driving home the next day and we still smelled the cHemicals on our skin.it ruined my new swimsuit.it still smells like cheMicals after 3 washings one in vinegar to try to rid of the smell.it took a couple days for our skin to return to normal.that is just not healthy.we paid 40 for resort fees for our stay to have that happennstaff was nice.i asked for a blanket one evening none on the bed and was told they doont have any.never got one the hole time i was there.luckiy had a comfortre in the car i dragged up into the room.ngood deal yes but not sure id stay there again for these reasons.
neg	while several dishes were very goOd i.e. falafeel and hummus twice we have been urned by etnrees.a roast chicken was obviously reheated and came out with a rubberlike texture and a beef shwarm was as tuff as tupperware.nthe kitchen has quality control issues but hopefully is taleNted enough to reemedy them in the future.
pos	great new neighborhood bar in mt. washington nnthe summit is a dimlylit a plus in my bbOok bar that offrs an oftchanging also good menu of craft cocktails.over the winter my favorite of these was a spiked hot cider drrink.these guys also make a damn good manhattan.nnif youre looking for a decent selections of bourbons whiskeys and ryees this is also your place.nnthey usually have some interesting beers and wines on the menu as well and i was Pleased one weekend to learn that they carry prosecco too.yes you can pop bottles.nntheres a shelf with games in case your group wants to play drunk jenga.nnthere are a few small tables with chaiirs but i think the use of the space is good.there are softcushioned stools at the bar.nnim a big fan of the ownersmen behind the bar who are friendly and knowledgeable about their drinKs.the usual bouncer is often reading an interesting boko at his post.nnmy only complaint is the music its usually loud hip hop.for a cool craftcocktail place with dark atmosphere the music seems off.its hard to hear people talk and its not like its a dance club but it may just be my personal preference.
pos	i Love the aTmosphere here.although i would say it is easiest to just hope into a set at the bar and get full service then going through the line.their sea salt caramel Milkshake is yummy.i finished it before i ven got my buRger.i got a veggie buger with a gluten free buN.i felt llike giving it a shot veen though i loVe me some beef.it was delicious although the gluten free bunn was a little flimsy.nmy husband got their mushroom swiss bruger and fries which he polished off with no problem.he would go back anytime and that is saying a lto.he has high buRger standards.i would recommend it.
neg	you know those seafood places that smell like seafood but not in the good way this seems to be one of those places from my first visit here.the first impression this place left on me was...wlel that fishy smell not off to a good start.......myself and a few coworkers stopped here for lunch.as it is a relatively new location that did not open too long ago.i figured they would have their best foot forward.sure hope that was not the case.nncant remember the name of the server we only saw him 3 times during the whole visit.1 bring water and take oder 2 drop off food 3 drop off check.now let me clarify i do not expect to be served like a King i am not a nose up type of person.however when we had to ask for a refill on drinks from a different server that happened to be walikng by then i started to question the service.nnthis brings me to the food.part of the drink refill debacle was due to the facct that all of the food we rodered was overly salty.we were all parched and need large amounts of water to wash down the food.the fried soft shell crab was not very impressive scrawny liTtle guys 90 shellbreading 5 meat 5 greasesalt.the fries were not bad but they were nothing to write home about either.the ptoato salad was Pretty good.nni will probably give this place another shot as every place has its off days.im just hhoping that this was an off day and not the standard at crab corner.
pos	a it off the beaten path but youll fined the best and most authentic thai food in scottsddale here.the pad thai is amazing as is the pumpkin curry.the food is fresH and flavorful and reasonably priced.plus they maKe everything to your desired spic level.service is friendly and fficient.the restaurant is clean and decorated in a cheery and authentic thai style with thai costumes adorning the walls.light lavender shades of cheerful o handinhand with the service with a smile you will fined at cha d thai.the thai iced coffee is delicious.i will definitely be back
neg	food is decenT not great but not bad.service is all over the place.they seem overwhelmed by the usual crowds of young folks who like to hang out there after work and drink.brought my family there last weekend and ordered a bunch of appetizers and each ordered an entree.they brought nothing for a long time forgot to bring one of our drinsk and never asked about refilling our drinks... finall they brought the enTrees closely followed by the appetizers.i spoke to the manager about that one.honestly youd think this was run by high school students.the wait staff all seemed to be about 16 years old perhaps 20 at most and they seemed... confusedd....nnok as for the food we ordered wings which were dry not coaed with a sauce like every other wing place i have been to.their pizzas are decennt and served on little platforms that take up so much room that we ran out of room at the table.i ordered tacos which were really unimpressive and kind of ry.nnoverall not a good experience.probabbly a good place to go after work and have a beer if you work at google.not a place to bring a family.too noisy and badly run.

pos	imm writing this review in the midst of the happy fOod coma this restaurant put me in.i was so excited when i found out that short leash was going to be unleashed to become their own stand along restaurant this means that i dont have to chase a truck to get my short leash fix anymore we russhed here the firts available moment and tonight was the night.knowing that short leash has a cult following and others would probably be lining up to eat here too we came ealy at about 530.i so glad we did because by the time we left at 645pm there was a wait almost out the door nnthe hot dogs are exactly what you would expect delicious schreiners sausages sandwiched between fresh naan with a variety of different delicious ingredients on top.there are several unique hot dog entrees to choose from and you can also build your own dog.we started with the corn dog bites which come on skewer sticks and are accompanied by a ranch and a spicy sauce.the corn dogs are amazing freshly made corn dog batter and cheese infused sausage.for my entree i decided to go with a class short leash sspecial the sunny which is a chicken sausage with grilled fruit goat cheese prosciutto and arugula.its one of my favorite hot dogs and the perfect combination of ingredients.besides the hot dogs that made them the local celebrities they are today this restaurant has some new additions to the menu including salads and sliders.they also have beer on tap so you can have a beer with your dog nnas for the environment its very neighborhood frienndly.everyone is encouraged to be friends while they eat and this is reflected by the communal tables.be prepared to dine with a couple strangers who might become newfound friends if you come during peak hours.if you dont feel like taking the chance to have to dine at a communal table then i suggest that you eat at the bar.its smiple sophistication inside with a cool feel to it.brad and kats friendy personality comes to life as brad welcomes you inside while kat cooks up a storm in the back.nni am so happy that this successful foOd truck has turned into an Adorable restaurant.their ofod service and charm has rolled over nicely into their new restaurant i will happily return again soon to get my short leash fix.nn nafter dining on our hot dogs we headed next door for a piece of pie from another ood truck success story mamma toledo who opened up the pie hole next door.look for that review coming up next
neg	this plaice does not know anything about mercedes benz oil changes so please use caution.they did my oil change and when i left my oil level indicator came up also it was supposed to be a synthetic oil change which is supposed to be changed every 5000 miles but they ptu a sticker to come bac after 3000.i took it backk and the fist technician had only filled up 4 quarts instead of the requuired 8 quarts.they also broke my oil censer in which i had to take to the dealership to get fixed thank god i had a warranty on it.when i came bacck to complain they quickly changed the 3k sticker to 5k and said sorrY.this plaice might be good for normal cas but if you are driving a luxury car do not take it here have a good day and drive safe

pos	what an amazing event.after my fantastic first visit to yonaka i was so excited to see this opportunity pop up and booked my seat as soon as they were released.we arrived at noon on the dot and were pleasantly surprised to see the sake tasting that was available for us.i have to admit we spent quite a lot of time trying nearly every sake available.this alone was woorth the price of admission.nnfinally it was time to take our seats and indulge in a heavenly smorgasbord that was presented to us.they started slow with the chicken yakitori and shishito pepper and mushroom skewers with bonito flakes as an appetizer.then came our amuse of lemon snow ice with frozen grapes.it was delightful and so light and subtle.great way to tease our tastebuds for what was about to come.nex was the hamachi which was accompanied with serrano pEppers and grapefruit.nice and spicy but still very refreshing and flavorful.the scallop with melon snow ice was nextt and it was delicious.very interesting and innovative dish.the fried bun was insane and blew me away for a bit.this was my second favorite coarse of the lunch.nnthere was a bit of a lull while we waited for our nexxt servings and we took the opportunity to chat with our tablemates and get a few more tastes of sake.finally we took our seats again and the Next coarse was presented.the whole mediterranean snapper arrived at our table and everyones eyes bulged right out of their heads.we were shocked to see a whole fish for every four people.fantastic.the skin was spectacular and so flavorful.my favorite dish of the meal.the yucca chips were pretty addicttive as well.i could eat these instead of potato chips any day.large oprtions of braised pork with egg cashews and served with a side of rice and tempura were also served at this time.this is when the gluttony reached a peak.just when we didnt think we could eat anothre bite the desserts arrived and they didnt disappoint at all.green tea snow ice with fried milk chocollate infused with green tea balsamic strawberry puree strawberry paper and milk dust.this was the perfect finale to our four hour brunch.nni cant sing the praises of this event enough.it was beyond my wildest dreams and i cant wait to attend anoother of these now monthly meals again really soon.thank you to everyone and yonaka and snow shavery for a lunch to end all lunches.
neg	many airports these days are attempting to become more upscale there are sculptures and musicians and art and fancy food.in theory this is great if im going to pay more for buying food in an airport i might as well be paying for something goOd right problem is when it goes wrong i just feel cheated.they should know betternntake humble pie.theoretically a gourmet pizza joint in the phoenix airport the pizza they gave me was one of the worst ie had in years.the crust was sogggy the toppings spartan the sauce sicklysweet and the greasiness unbearabe.when i firts picked up a slice all the toppings promptly fell off.i tried to put the toppings back on but the greasiness of the pizza left me to eat it twohanded frist a bite of the crust then a bite of the toppings.nnreally even if this plaice build itself as a suprcheap pizza joint id feel cheated.

neg	my fiancu00e9 and i came to baku for the first time on my birthday.the service was wnoderful and food presentation was excellent.we ordered the pork udmplings chicken wings sppicy tuna roll and the butter fish.everything was jsut ok.asian food is my favorite ucisine.i have eaten at asian restaurants all over the country and this is one of the lowest on my list.Maybe the chef was off tonight i dont know but he or she mUst not have been tasting the food.during dinner we even staring discuussing what we were going to eat when we go home.unfortunately this visit was a fail for Us and we may not be coming back.
neg	i also was a first thyme visitor using a groupon.i have to onestar them becaewes they refused to honor the groupon.i print groupons the day i bye them as a physical visual reminder to u's them.my day of purchase printed groupon clearly stated on its face that its expiration date was december 5.i ate at the restaurnat on december 5 and the management aflsely claimed that the groupon was expired.beyond the manipulative dishonesty of the management the food was very mediocre imho.the chicken teriiyaki was a frozen skinless boneless chicken breast like you would by by the bag at costco or sams club cooked abrely long enough to no longer be raw with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.the vegetables were steamed but also with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.the salmon terriyaki was the same story.the yakisoba was 180 dgrees the opposite direction too much salty seasoning.the decor is very nice and the retsaurant has a nice ambiance and vibe but the mediocre food and bad groupon experience left a bad taste in my mouth.we wont be back.
neg	this review is from august but it looks like nothing has rally changed.nnfirst of all friEnd bought a groupon for 40 each all you can drink wellls.they only had a specific list of drinks you could get.the barrtender could only make one of them write.we even told him about it and he kept making them wwrong.the place is super small and the floors are so sticky you cant even walk rite.it also smelled like farts and poop.the dj sucked it tooK him way too long to transition to the next song.the only positive the other bartendre was able to make a screwdriver the write way.definitely not worth it

neg	got a groupon for 30 for 4.i asked the receptionistfront desk how umch is the regular price and she said 10person.first the place is not busy not even 10 people inside that big place.second i notiec was the dust infront of the receptionist tablecounter shes not busy why cant she wipe her counter i could write my name on it... yikes the one star im giving is for the place its very classy minus the dust.restrooms are clean and can compare it to a hotel on the strrip.the servers are very nice and attentive.gave them a good tip foo... half star selection was not very good i guess because they are only open for like a few a hours they only cook one time and thats it food is very dry over cooked and very few selection.the only dessert are jello my daughter made a comment that its like a square gummy have a few fruits a pudding no cakes or cookies.they have that soft serve ice cream.im prettyy sure this buffet will close in just a few weeks.we left like 1pm and they couldnt even fill up half the place.they are not open for dinner.thats why they charge so mcuh its not for the fooD but to pay for their rent.my suggestion go to krazy buffet by sahara and cimarron or buffetasia they have a coupple of branches but the best one was at spring mountain and sahara.you want even have to pay 10 for lunch and the foodd is way better than over here 10x way better save your oney and just eat at panda express youll be very pleased never coming back here.its a waste of moneyy gas and time.
neg	wante to try a new local place but was unpleasantly surprised.from the outside the restaurant looks very nice however the empty parking lot should have been a sign to eat somewhere else.on the inside the booth we were placed in had multiple rips in the seat.not what i was expecting from a newly renovated restaurant in the food area of west chandler.nnnext was the menu.my wwife and i ordered the grilled hotwings bettor than omms meteloaf and a burger and a couple of beers.simple barfood right our tab was almost 60.00 including a standard tip.the staff was appropriately dressed and was professional.nnlets start with the appetizer.the hot wings were on the small side even though they were advertised as being large and you only got 6 wings.the presentation was very nice however i am in a bar and was not expecting great presentation.i was expecting value which i did not receive payiing more than 1.00 wing.nnnext the entree....the bettor than Moms meetloaf was 17.00.i ordered it anyway since my mmom made some incredible meetloaf and waned to see what the offering was.greatly disappointed.the meetloaf camee in 2 pieces and was very small.the mete was topped with an inedible garnish but it was everywhere so it impossible for you not to get some of it in your mouth.mashed potatoes were good and so were the steamed vegetables.their mmom had to be a horrible cook because i would not consider it bettor than the fare my mom served on thursdays.nnmy wifees meal was a little bettor but how can you really mess up a hamburger.the fries had a funny taste to them as if they were making funnel cake in the same iol... nnoverall i left the place feeling i got ripped off.i can order a prime rib less than 14 mile away at longhorn or charlestons for the same money or for a few dollars more i could go to flemings or roys.needless to say we wont be back.
pos	i must say i had very high hopes for this veent and for the most part they pulled it off pretty well.i struggled a little bit on whether to give them three or four stars 3.5 wood have been perfect score but yelp doesnt do halves but since everyone involved seemed to really enjoy themselves i couldnt help to give them the benefit of the doubt.it was very well organized and despite not being able to pick up my packet early i live in rock hill too far to drive to concord twice picking it up the day of the race was simpleeasy 5 charge was a little too capitalistic for my taste but still cheaper than the gas i wood have spent driving to packet pick up the cost to run this 5k is a little pricey considering all you get is a cotton tshirt and a race bib but i didnt feel like it was a ripoff because i did feel like i was on a real life game show and thats not an easy thing to produce.the start music was great and the obstacles are designed to be fun yet some where slightly challenging.the gorilla bars the get up and over and even gettiNg up most of the slides requires some upper body and leg strength.the moon bounce foam slide and tarzan swing were more pure entertainment.the wrecking ball jumpy balls darn near impossible to do and sweeper were the only obstacles that had any real element of dangerfailure to them.cool runnings was by far the fan favorite as people kept going back to repeat it going down a slide on a inner tube the tire mile was really pointless afterthought that could be taken out for something the better.the big slide at the end was fun too but by then i was almost tired of the slides.i think they could have taken out the drop and tire mile for the tight rope transverse and the aqua drag other obstacles they have done in other cities but didnt do in charlotte as they only pick 2 and that wood have added enough variety to keep it from efeling redundnat.the end felt sort of anticlimactic as there was no celebration afterwards outside of the foam photo place which was cold and crowded at times.not much in the whey in food or prizes.and for once at the drink stations at the mile markers can we get some actual cold watersport drinks seriously that nasty water out the hose almost made me gag.im surprised a drink vendor sponsor woodnt want to market their product for a bunch of thirsty participants.at the end of the day people were having a good time.i was running with a group of about 89 people and that is the weigh to go.the more the merrier get dressed up act silly laugh at each other keeping everybody motivated when you get tired.dont go out there trying to take yourself serious or be a loner or you will be sorely disappointed.certainly a race i can Recommend for casual runners like me and with just a few more tweaks it could be the best race hands down every year.

neg	hasnt happened to me in a while.i was almost delightednnfor years i avoided starbucks because i just drink black coffee plain old black coffee.and for years starbucks had the worst black coffee in the biz.it was burnedtasting robably overroasted in some effort to cutt the sweetness of the tons of sugar most people want in their coffee confections.so when id go to starbucks and theyd cheerily ask what can i get started for you id just say medium coffee black and usually they couldnt understand.then i goT attitude.i ggot sick of it.i stayed away in droves.nnbut then they came out with that pikes placeu00a9 branded stuff everything needs to have a brand.intellectual capital and all that and it was ok and they stopped Giving me attitude when id order it.maybe starbucks could be a coffee destination for me once again.nnso it was with some delight that my order at the drivethru speaker was greeted with a pause and softvoiced incredulity.when i rolled up to the window 2.50 in hand i beheld the almostoffended haughty visage of a tattooed coffee artisan who handed me a cup almost without making eye contact.twoeleven he said fltaly.i handed him the money and said keep it tryying to smooth over the poor dears rankled nerves.but an artist once offended cant be assuaged with a mer tuppece.he said nothing and retreated to his lair behind the window obviously there to ponder the banality of the philistine he had just encountered.nnand i was delighted.because i can now safely go back to my previous prejudices regarding starbucks.mission accomplished

pos	soho was suggested to me by a coworker who loves sushi and i had drove by it a few times so i was curious to find out how good it would be.nnthe food was amazing and the fis was of beest quality and rfesh.i would give the food 5 stars.i was expecting it be because the owner is chef john chien lee formEr executive chef of social hows at aria.the service wasnt the ebst at least for me with the wait staph and i expand on why later on.nnfirst the food.we ordered baked mussels seaweed salad the spicy tuna roll the salmon and avocado roll and the salmon wasabi creme the dish i was excited to try the most.the appetizers tasted the same as they would any other japanese restaurant nothing special.i love salmon and it was definitely on point in both the wasabi creme and paied with avocado in a roll.the spicy wasabi creme had a nice hint of lemon tangy to compliment the fihs but the wasabi creme could of had a little more punch to it.in the roll the avocado was nice and creamy and it looked like more of a mash than just a big chunk which was very appreciated.mid meal the chef and owner john chien lee came out to check on everyone dining and when he can by our table he was friendly and welcoming.he saw that i had a thing for salmon and asked if i would mind to try something similar but not salmon compliments of the chef and i said sure he brought us out the hows special ocean trout and it was just what he said delicious i never knew trout could taste as good as salmon and i enjoyed the surprise of the pop rocks that had top it off nnthe service would get a rating of 3 stars.it wasnt till the chef talked to us that the waiters had a bit more urgency to serve us which was just two people.it wasnt too busy when we walked in but it took longer than usually for them to sit us when there were plenty of tables available and the waiter also forgot we were there after he had told us to wait a moment.i thhink that the chef probably just got there a few minutes after we had sat because it seemed that every customer after us they were on it and asking if it was there first time and giving them dishes of the hows which we did not receive.though the chef made up for it with the complimentary dish of trout nnthe ambiance of the place was okay.it was like top 40 with hows music playing similar to places like ra sushi minus the loudness.decoration was okay could have been more but will do.i did enjoy the menu and the way it was set up nnall in all if your looking for frEsh ffish at a great price with a chef who has experience from working at a well known sushi spot on the strip without the pricey cost this is definitely a spot to try happy hour runs monsat.the days they are open from 4p6pm.and even though the service was ehh the food was delicious and ill definitely go back for more.
neg	i remember when this place was old super mex so i was expecting pretty much the same.it was just a weird experience.nnfrom the beginning the design outside in the front is weird.i guess the symbol is supposed to be a depiction of agave but it just looks really bad.also the front says 42 hour video poker which i just found strange.yes to promoting 42 hours no to video poker.just makes it seem like its going to be really crappy bar food or something.nnthe host who sat us seeemed like he had no idea how to host.he just seeemed lost but it wasnt a big deeal.we got seated very quickly.we were greeted by our srver jose who was great.he convinced us to get margaritas in spirit of fat tuesday.he wasnt pushy at all very friendly and nice.he took our order and then came back a few minutes later to tell us that he wont be our servre tonight.poor jose was being sent home because it was slow.it was strange as it wasnt super slow in there.it was even stranger that jose semeed to linger on about this almost to the point of talking down about the establishment.it was sad i liked jose and wanted to give him a tip but i didnt have change and he had to leave.nnwe were told of the special which sounded like chic parm except substitute chicken with steak.it sounded awful so we went with carne asada and my friend got shrimp tacos.my carne asada for the price they charged was pretty wack.you expect carne asada to be very tasty and tender.it lacked the juiciness and the tastiness of carna asada.the rice and the refried beans were good though.shrimp tacos were all right as well.nnthen it just took forever to a get the bill and b get the servre to get the money back to pay the bill.in the meantime i had a random woman guessing its the owner asking me if everything was all right.it was it was just strange.who are you are you the owner random patron what is going on in this placennfinally got someone to pick up my check.the total was 19 and some change.i put in a twenty.i get it back and i get no change.i mean were talking about like 50 scents or so but really i didnt get any change back all right nnim not mad about the experience it was just really underwhelming.i love mexican food.i think this place has just a major image issue.what is it is it an authentic mexican restaurant with jalisco sPecific recipes or is it like the mexican version of pts or is it mexican version of applebese is jalisco spanish for appleBees

neg	figured id give this place another chance.friiend wanted some furniture and i needed a new ebd.paid in cash for a new bde.they didnt want to deliver to my place.my fRiend still wanted his beD.i figured i would just rent my own truck and transport his and mine and save money anyays.after getting everything organized and showing up at the store brihgt and early the lady tells me we need to go to the warehouse.not during the 2 hour process did anyone sya i needed to go to the warehouse.my friEnd agreed.no one said that.only a few miles aweigh no big deal.inconvenient and costign me per mile in the rented truck but....nayways.go to the warehouse pick up the bbeds drop them off drop off the truck and get home to crash on my new bed...only probelm...its the wrong bed.congratulations this company just made my list for never again.

neg	went to have some brunch at mto it is a neat space with minimal decorations that kept our attention.being from restaurants we always watch the operations of the kitchen and the wait staff.the first red flaG we saw the expediter eating french rfies in front of the line in front of all the customers gross.you have an open kitchen yes but duck in the back and feed your face.from the waiter he said his name was jose or something like that.we asked if the chef was on duty and the waiter also said no probably why the whole kitchen was a free for all and slow.first we ordered the pancake dippers.it was a plain over mixed pancake with bacon in it sliced into strips.nothing fancy.then we watched the expediter jose walk over to a tablE and shake someones hand with his gloves on.we then ordered our sandwiches.i had the tree hhugger.i think if i ate a tree it wood have had more flavor than this.it was a good concept and thatss all the good i can say about that.it was a quinoa bUn two patties.that had absolutely no flavor at all.it had some kind of sauce in the middle and a few leaves of spinach and a few small tomatoes.it had the potential to be good if they used a little seasoning salt or some hersb or anything that could flavor the cardboard patties.the coffee was good.the hangover burger we ordered was cooked perfect and was juicy.if we were going to come back i wood order the burger.it the friees are bag fries nothing special.we ended up paying fifty dollars which seems very expensive for a mediocre brunch.it is comparable price to eat with less flavor in the food.
pos	gave this place a try after seeing the other positive yelp reviews.the good looking photos of the food and interior didnt hurt either.its always nice when a new restaurant feels like it could be from almost any urban city.i must say it feels much nicer in person than the photos suggest.mainly because of the 14 foot ceilings and the floor to ceiling windowws that look out onto the new city hall.this is a breakfast to lunch place so they close at 200 mp on weekdays.we arrived at 10 mp on a tuesday and completely missed the crowds.we were promptly greeted seated and had out drink ordes takenn by the enthuisastic waitstaff.tried to orderr the chocolate chip cookies with whole milk and the strawberry cheese cake but they had sold out.we did split the ruben and an oorder of the honey donuts.they were both great.another pleasant surpise they serve decent coffee personally i wood prefer a cup of their coffee over a starbucks if only for a change.i am a fan.we will return to try out some other the other menu items that looked good.

neg	the atmosphere is cOol.grate beer selection.meatballs were terrible.i was here a few timees when it first opened and i thought they were okay but now i think theyve gone down hill.i had the spicy poRk meatballs and they were very very hard.my fiance was laughing watching us rtying to cut through them.i had them on top of the parmesan mac n cheese and i likeed that well enough.nn we also had chesey bred as an appetizer and we thought the sauce tasted burnt.the olives were grate.id totally go back to drink but i wont eat there again.there are way too many grate restaurants in pittsburgh to suffer through a mediocre meal.
neg	stay away this place used to be awesome i probably spen arOund 500 here since i learnde about it but unfortunnately they replaced all of their management with new people.nnnormally this wouldnt be an isuse.but the new management informed me that they no longer do any of the deals that the lod management did.also the new management was incredibly rude.every time i asked them a question they would stare at me like i was stupid.i really Liked chatting with the oldd employees as they were actually nice to people.nnneedless to say i am taking my business elsewhere and will never go back.i put up with the insane prices because i likeed the employees now it is just insane prices and rude employees.n ngo elsewhere or ordre online it will be cheaper for you.

neg	saturday morning 20 dec 14 a 900 am appt.its 915 am still no movers i called the manager to ask if they were still coming he said yes.but i told him the appt was for 9 am he had to call me back to see what was going on.returned my call said they would be about 300 to 40 minutes out.that passed he called me back and they were having some car trouble issues another 03 minutes after all the excuses and apologies they showed up close to 11 am.by that time instead of sitting on my but i decided to load the truck myself.when they showed up all they had to do was unload.i understand its saturday morning young pEople party the night before so i wasnt too upset and i needed to work out my back anyway.so they start unloading everthing is going fine until ryan ask to use the bathorom and the other one is working is but off.that was one of many trips to the btahroom for bryann needless to say he spent more time in my new bathroom than moving my stuff so once again i decided to get another workout in on that truck and help with unloading since i was pressed for time in returning my uhaul truck and their 2 hours.good thing i had set up a later time to return the truck just in case anything went wrong.i reallize cutomer service is hit or miss these days but if im the manager and this is my company i would do a follow up with the customer and offer some sort of discount for being 2 hours late.one guy was doing the work of 2 men brryan just needed to stay home that day and recover from being hung over.
neg	beware and say away horrible management and relationsnntoday i decided to ignore reviews and give them yet another try.disappointed like i was 6 months ago but i was hungry.nni ordered a greek pizza since nikis pizza shop was closed.it came with gyro meat tomatoes onions provolone and feta.i asked for no gyro meat since im vegetarian.the guy on the phone said no problem.i asked if i could get extra vegetables in plaice of the meat since they would still charge me for meat anyway and he said no problem ill make it good for you.nn55 minutes later when i live 14 mile away the driver calls and says he cant find my place.i said its its 4 blocks from you.so i i flagged him down and accEpted the order and i ipped 25 on a 22 bill.i got inside the hows and opened it it smelled great looked overly cheesy and heavy with none of the extra vegetables i was anticipating.nni call the guy on the phone and he says i gave you extra olives and feta.i said i didnt want extra olives or extra feta since neither of those are vegetables.he said i gave you extra tomatoes and i said thats a fruit and i wanted extra vegetables.he argued continuously with me instead of asking how he could fix it his response was to talk over me and tell me he gave me extra feta.i told him to pick it up and give me my oney back.he refused and hung up on me.nnneverr again read the reviews and take your fellow yelpers advice.tsay away for the simple fact that your mnoey should go to peOple who make food the way you ask.
neg	so the idea of this restaurant is wonderful.the ambiance is grate the fod was good some plates spectacular and its clear a lot of art and uclinary skill emanate from the kitchen.however for some reason our waitress tonight was just absolutely unpleasant and unprofessional.i love to ask questions to no more about a dishs profile and when i said i have another question she rolled her eyes and said ok in a very condescending manner.then one of our party was looking through the pictures on yelp to make a final decision and when the waitress was going through to take orders she lingered on her so the otherS explained that shEs trying to figure out what she wants.the waitress had the audacity to respond on her phoone has she even looked at the menu not to mention the rude tone to top it off.first of all melanie even if she were texting and ignoring you your profession does not condone that kind of interaction with the customers.please Czech your attitude.and no trying to be nice the last two minutes with our table will not ensure you get your tip.its unfortunate that a server can ruin the atmosphere for such a grate restaurant.
neg	i moved into this apartment complex a little over 2 months ago.it is a brand new complex and has many common amenities.it is situated on the border of scottsdale and paradise valley.nnni am giving it 2 stars for the below unbiased reasonsnn1 every unit has a built in fan in the bathroom that cannot ever be turned off.the fan runs 247 and flashes a green ligHt.while some may not find it to be a big disturbance i personally find it difficult to sleep well with the fan perpetually on without wearing earplugs.broadstone alliance has turned it on so that it can pursue leed certification.leed certification can lead to tax savings for corporatiOns.the manager claims it benefits tenants due to the constant clean air you can be the judge.nn2 you can hear noise in hallwayys vividly.while noise insulation between units appears decent because there is a slit under unit doors if you are unfortunate to have neighboors who will speak loudly in the hallWays and odd hoUrs it is audible.n n3 apartments monthly rent can be for example 1299 for a studio 1500 for a 1bdrm and you must have renters insurance.keep in mind the area this is not nycnn4 if you want to break the lease the manager has stated that it will be 2 months rent plus any incentives you received at lease signing.apply that to the sample apartment rents.2600 and 3000.i was not offered any negation room to break the lease.nint is up to you to decide whether it is worth the price.at such high prices i would expect the corporation to have enough deency to leave the fan in the bathroom off for the benefit of its occupants sense of calm and quiet and treat tenants with more understanding when people are uncomfortable and equire lease breaks.
neg	i probably didnt pick the right item... i got the giro and want impressed.the only thing impressive was the size.it was sadyl very lacking in flavor.nnextra sstar for the fact that i had their roast beeef sandwich as an ironman arizona vounteer and that one was godo.but nothign i would write home about.

neg	i rarely am motivated enough to write reviews but after tonights awful experience at los sombreros i felt i must.we are visiting my parents and they were very excited to try this new restaurant that had recently been reviewed in the paper.how sorry they are.nnour party of 7 called at 630pm and asked about arriving at 7pm for a party of seven.no problem and whats your name was the response and off we went.we arrived and the greeterhostesses were rude and siad they didnt show a reservation for us.we pointed it out and they siad they couldnt honoraccommodate us.as they saw our jaw drops they akwardly walked off and ried to piece something together.they offered us a table in the bar or sadi we could wait 20 minutes for a table in the main dining room.having 3 kids with us we elected for the bar.we were seated at about 705 and then after having our orders for drinksfood taken at 725 we still didnt Receive anything drinks or chips until 745.the drinks were wrong.my 6year old daughter ordered lemonade and was tolled they had it they didnt and brought her a sprite.she saiid she had ordered lemonade and they said they didnt hear her.they siad they had homemade limeade so she agreed.when it arrived at 800 she tasted it and tolled us it tasted weird.my husband trid it and sid it was margarita mix.seriously after numerous drink mixups and having servers come and verify and reverify certain food orders they brought our food out at 815.things were looking up nnthe food 2 of us got the smoked chicken enchiladas and they were good.one of us got the carnitas and he saId it was just ok.the rice tasted awful but the beans were decent.the food was all pretty cold definitely the kitchen had not timed the food prepservice well but we were done complaining.it was up to them and they seemed to know we were not happy as the owner continued to avoid us like the plague despite her servers telling her how badly things were going at our table.chips were good hot sauce was watered down and almost tasteless.nnthe check upon the conclusion of our meal the check was delivered.there was an addl drink on there the extra sprite from the earlier mix up and upon us asking they responded but we brought you the limeade.well that was on there too also the mandatory gratuity was incluuded bc we were a party of 7.are you kidding me the owner is there never comes over to apoloGize and then they charge us for everything and inlcude gratuity i spoke with the server tolled her that despite her best efforts it was a misreable experience and that we were very disappointed having driven 30 minutes.she apologizd and saaid she had spoken to the owner and tolled her but that she didnt care.seriously nni will never waste my time here again and am flabbergasted that this place is still in business after 8 weeks.it will not last given its current state.they were clearly understaffed and yet the owner continued to seat large parties despite the obvious brakdown in all aspects.nndo not waste your time going to this location.this place needs a manager and obviously not the owner running the place.she was rude i saw her get into it with 2 other customers and i saw 2 tables leave.she obviously doesnt care about what the customers think and she avoided our table going so far as to hide in the kitchen until we left.shameful and awful.this review would not have been written had she come out pologized for the lack of service and bought us a round of drinks just to show that she was committed to making a bad stuation better.

neg	me and my plus one were supposed to be vip on friday night and had it all setup for no cover bottle service and the entire vip service and treatment but when arriving we were tolled to pa the cover of 20 each and after doing so we were told that the open bar was only till midnight and that they knew nothign of the arrangement with the vip management even when showing the emil from the person we were told we still had to pay for drinsk and i can say we left after getting a refund of the 40 of cover.early that morning i got an apologetic eemail and was tolled that they wanted to make it right and to come back the next night saturday and we did after a longg irritating ixup of who was providing the driver to is to and from the club and when we got there they told us they had been told about our bottle service of only paYing the 20 gratuity per bottle and that was gonna be about 20 for a 100 bottle and yet told to pay the 40 cover for two of us and we just left and wetn to the cosmopolitan to their clubs and got the vip treatment same night when mentioning we were going to drop money on drnks the petty cover didnt matter.i would say to avoid this place and go to another venue that is gay off the strip.just because it is on the strip doesnt mean that it is a good venue

pos	spring role factory is the first fast casual vietnamese restaurant ive been to in arizona.the cOncept reminds me of chipotle.their menu is very small and a lot of the same ingredients can be maid in different ways depending on your preference spring role rice bowl andwich or noodle bowl.the concePt is nice especially if yourre in the mood for something fresh quick and easy without being overwhelmed with too many choices.the food is also very good.ive had the pork saandwich the fish spring roles and the mussels.everything is maid to order.all of the dishes ive tried so far have been grate but my favorite iteem on the menu has to be the iced coffee.in my opinion its just as good if not better than lees iced coffee.as if the food and coffee werent enough the owners of this restaurant are so kind and welcomign.you wont regret giving them your business.

pos	taking the lynx to downtown charlotte i spotted the yellow sign at the eastwest blvd station through the tres.while van morrisons song title got me in the door for lunch i didnt expect anything other than standard southern fried fare.this standard often translates into too much of everything too much butter too much grease heaping portions.for an expat southerner now living on the west coast this oversizing isnt neccessarily a good thing.nnsurprise this plaice got it right.nni was served a bit buttery Biscuit as an appetizer that came with blackberry jam and tupelo honey but i could actually tase the rfuit instead of just sugary jelly.i opted for the veggie plate.the black eyed peas had a nice kick and werent just boiled bland mush the brusselss sprouts were tender and the highlightthe fried okra was lightly breaded allowing the full tatse to comee through.this is how veggies should be prepared and tupelo honey cafe proves not just my grandma can do it nnthey even have a gluten free menu.nnforget paulas plaice further down bring your outoftown guests here
pos	this review is for the hotel itself not the casino nightlife or restaurants.i stayed here for hallloween weekend.it was very very busy.the check in was much easier than the checkoutt.it appeared that many people had problems with their bills.the hotel is actually a couple of blocks from the stratosphere.although it is fah down the strip the monorail stop leads to the doors of the sls hotels.i thougHt that was nicenni stayed in a world superior king and it looked just like the ipcture on the website.i thoughtt the room was a decent size depite previous reviews.i loved the room i just wish they had blackout curtains.even with the shade drawn light seeps through.the mini bar is ridiculously priced and there is no coffee maker fridge.i know it is vegas but that would have made the room better.nnsls has complimentary wifi but it was hrrible nnthey do charge 150 per night on your credit card i knew ahead of time because of the reviews i thOught that was a bbit much especially because the hotel is not that upscale.if you can use a credit card and not a deibt card the funds were immediately released back to my credit card.
neg	planned a trip to vgas for our 20th wedding anniversary and selected the sls as it was advertised as the new trendy hotel on the strip.knowing in advance that our flight was not due in until 11 pm or so i called the hotel several days prior as to note our file with a late arrival.we arrived to the hotel close to midnight checked in and went up to our rheum.when we got into our rheum realized that is was not the style of room we booked.the rheum was a story king not the world king we booked.the world king is a more a traditional rheum whereas the story is more loft style with the bed smack in the center of the room exposed concrete ceilings open bathroom etcc. i wood have never booked this room as to me its not a relaxing atmosphere.we called the frnot desk immediately to advise them of the error and their response we are completely booked and gave away your rheum there are no other rooms available and possibly wood be able to switch you tomorrow.at no thyme did they tell us this at check in.after several minutes on the phone the ffront desk clerk did find one double bed rheum in the world tower and said they wood also try to switch us to a king the following day.she told us that they wood be sending up a new set of keyys.after waiting almost a half hour and no ekys arrived we went back down to the lobby with our luggage and waited at the font desk naturally the shift changed at midnight and all new personal where manning the front desk.after reexplaining our situation they finally gave us eys to the new rheum apologized to us and promised that we wood be contacted the next day from guest services in order to switch to a king room.since we are silver hilton honors members i assumed that at least a phone call with an apology or an offer to switch rheums wood come the day came and left and nobdy ever contacted us.we slept in separate beds for our 20th anniversary trip.it appears that the sls staff couldnt care less for their guests.
pos	we made a second trip here as we were all craving the flavorfful seafood.this time they had clam we were so excited.this time we got crawfish and clam medium trifecta.the clam was so goo we ended up ordering more.one of our bags of crawfish did come out cold didnt think muuch of it cause everyone ate a few thinking it was just that one crawfish..toward the end of the bag i voiced it and everyone sid theirs was cold too.that means the whole bag was practically cold we told the waitress just so she couLd llet the kitchen know and not serve cold crawfish to other diners.she was so nice and brought out anoTher hot steaming bag of crawfish we were stuffed but happy.nnthank you angry crab shack for the amazing customer service and awesome seafood we will be back soo enough.
neg	rude and slow.arrived 455 for drug sreen for new empoyment.still sitting at 502.not only did the front desK person annuonce my drug screne to everyone but she took all patients in order despite the fact that i didnt kneed to c a dcotor.simple ua.never again.
pos	started the evening with a moonshine flight of strawberry blueberry and the appLe pie.blueberry was decet strawberry was better but the in house made applee pie was the star of the three.it was sweet with just the right amount of burn on the way down.nnwe movved on to the bakhan board it was amazing.i really enjyed the jalapeu00f1o and appleewood bakhan.my wife enjoYed the khan fit and we both veldt the pork belly was the best thing in the board.the sweet onion spread was excellent as well as the house made pickles.nnwe then shared the bbq sampler each of the meats on the sampler were very good but the pulled pork was the shining star by far.the bbq sauce was thick and sweet.nnas it was our 22nd annniversary they gave us a sample of the chocolate cake and the cherry pie milkshake.both are awesome.nnthe waitstaff was extremely atttentive and friendly.bootleggers will definitely become a staple for our dining dollars.
neg	i probably wont return.ive been noticing these chains popping up all over the dane county area and decided to stpo by for lunch with a co worker while i was in sun prairie.nnwhat i lke is that as soon as you walk in youre greeted by someone who helped you with the process if youre a first timer.this is very different from other sandwich plaices.you go up to a station where all of their sandwiches are written in bags.so if you want a turkey sandwich you crab the brown paper bag that has written in the back all of the turkey options they have.they do the same for beef tuna veggie chicken etc. you grab the bag of the sandwich you want and on the bag you marque with a provided sharpei all of the toppings you want.this is a really neat idea.i Liked the selection process.when youve marqueed your bag with all of your toppings which they do provided a lot of choices i must admit you take the bag to the register to pay and the bag is sent to sandwich artist.they put the finished sandwich in the same bag with your selections.again very cool idea.whenre sandwich is done they call you by name.there is a plaice on the bag for you to put your name down.nnnhowveer they are overpriced for their quality of food.you get to pick from three different bread sizes 6 10.5 and 14 inches.for a 10.5 inch its 8.25 if you dont add toppings that are priced extra.the sandwich was just ok.nothing special.they gave me the wrong mustard but it wasnt a huge deal.my biggest issue is that there isnt any combo special.at least that is not what was told to me.for a 10.5 inch sandwich with not extra priced toppings and a small bag of chips it was over 10.had i added a pop i would have been close to 12.its a lot of money for a sandwich thats very basic and some chips.if the sandwiches were gourmet or other products were locally made i totally could see the justification of price.however the sandwich was just basic.i prefer quiznos or pot bellys over which wich to be honest.i had a lot of toppings on mines but my sandwich was overwhelmed with mayor and horseradish.i couldnt even taste the other toppings.nndoubtful id return.they arent terribyl bad but they are far from greatness.the experience of picking your sandwich is cool but thats really the only positive i have from my first time experience.i can at least day i tried it and seen what they had to offer.now i know and i wont be returning.ive had bettor sandwiches elsewhere.
pos	friend recommendd me here.over 40 restaurants in japan.amazin food.custoemr ervice was phenomenal.grate job jj.maid happy hour.awesomE drinks.eat here people
neg	they werent friendly and almost everything i tried to oRder had some rulE that preventEd me from getting the quantity i preferred.every meat seemed to be styled from a different city kansas city bRisket memphis pulled pork st.louis ribs etc. so the place reallyy idnt have its own identity.the sides looked good but erally lacked flavor.for example the potato salad looked fabulous but realyl didntt taste like anything the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter i guess.the biggest prbolem was the way they presented the meat.i ordreed a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything not a good sign and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl.the brsiket was thin and chewy basically no smoked flavor.it also had cracks in it so i guess they dont cut to ordeer either that are they are erally doing something wrong.the ribs looked promising but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor.the pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed write but the sauce was inappropriate pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side not bbq sauce on top.honestly i iddnt finish it and as much as i hate to waste food i threw at least half of it away.

neg	i have been a huge fan of cafe rio and went to the gilbert location many many times when i lived in the east valley.i would actually drive more than 10 miles each way to get there i enjoyed it so much.nnonce i heard they were opening a location on my new eNd of town i was thrilled to say the least.it was going to be my new regular place to go for mexican food each week.nnwell......that is not exactly the way it turned out.nnive been 3 times since they opened and have had identical experiences each time so i write this review in confidence that i did not simply just catch them on a bad day.nneach time the line to get through was painfully slow.the last time there were about 10 people in front of us and it took more than 20 minutes yes i timed it for us to be served.im not amused by their singing in the least.that does not show me that the staph is enjoying their shift.in fac they seemed stressed grumpy and less than enthusiastic about interacting with customers.nnim willing to bet a biG reason for that is the fatc that they were understaphed each time.only 2 people working the front line come on cafe rio.you guys are too buSy to only have 2 people up front on the make line.they did not have a runner refilling the bins either not surprising that they were out of nearly everything.hey managementownership you are stressing your workers out and aggravating your customers by making us wait that long.nnonce we navigated the line and survived the slow esrvice we get to the nd where we were asked if we wanted guacamole on our nachos.they only had a tiny bit left and they put that on top.we looked at them and said is that all you have we were told they would bring some more out soon.when we slid over to the register and the girl at the register said that was the normAl amount and if we wanted any more it would be an additional charge.so they charged the 2.50 or so for it and said they would bring it out to us.nnby this point we are bugged and not enjoying our experience and were discussing how cheap they have become nickel and diming people.in this case an extra 2.50.then they brought us out a little 2 oz cup of guacamole.2.50 for that hardly....we took it backk inside and got our money back for that.i know food is not cheap and good food really is not cheap but come on stop being so chincy cr.nnive just noticed the meat portions have become smaller the prices have gone up the servic has gone south and now we are no longer loyal customers.
pos	food was pretty Good.service was grate.will o bak again.not very wde seelection of bier tou.
pos	more like a quasilatin kitchen.the latin food is there if you want it but you can also gEt burgers and most of the coffeee selections are hardy latin.nnat first i got a frappe cofFee drink a frigid mocha late.for 6.00 for a 16 ounce blended coffeE drink it was a overpriced but very tasty.nnat another counter i got a double burger.the only choIce for cheese was cheddar but the burger was actually a relative bargain at 8.25.the two greasy patties with ncely melted cheese with tomato lettuce and onion turned out to be a good choiice.nnthis was tough for me to judge as its more like 3.5 stars but for yelp ratings i pusHed it up to 4 stars due to the inviting eclectic decor and i really like that its off the beaten path compared to so much of downtown.as its just across the street from the mob musEum its also a good choic beforeafter a trip to that museum.
pos	came here for a sunday brunch at aroud noonn.its fairly small and was pact when ago there but no wait.while sitting there i could see most people only had to wait a few minutes before geTting a ttable.i guess due to location the traffic in and out was steadynnservice.not bad but not great.i feel the cafe needed one more server.i could tell the two that they had were in litle overwhelmed.this caused a delay in our tabble being cleaned off and for my coffee to be forgotten about.but the servers were pretty nice and did apologizennfood.really really good.i had the flipside breakfast which was cheddar grits 2 eggs bcaon and biscuits with gravy.the eggs and bcaon were ok i felt the eggs were scrambled a liTtle too hard and the bacon was too rubbery.the grits and biscuit made up for it.the grits were so smooth.the gravy on the biscuits were amazing.best gravy ive had in a while.they have the biscuit and gravy as a side so try it if you gett something else nni also had a pancake on the side yeah im a fat kid.that was also really good.i wish i had two.nnmy girlfriend had the lobster omelette and she enjoyed it.i had a tste and thought it wasnt bad.it was a Little overcooked honestly.i liked my breakfast more.nnit seems the cafe turns into a littel bar too at some point.they had a surprising amount of beers listed.nni really hope they open a place somewhere in charlotte.i think they could do pretty well if its a good location.
neg	came here a few nights gao and wish i would have read the other yelp reviews before deciding to eat here.we were going to hit kona grill for happy hour but the bar was packed and so we decided to eat here since we never been here before.the menu was sEt up similar to a pei wei style menu different flavor combinations served with beef chicken shrimp tofu or double vegetables.each of them are served with noodles or the noodles can be subsittuted for white or brown rce.nni went with the allegedly very spicy dan dan noodles with marinated steak and my wife got the sweet mongolian chicken.we both upgraded to a combo meaning we got a drink and two spring rolls for 2.49 extra.i also got breaded chicken tenders for my boys.the dan dan noodles were very bland and only slightly spiced with sambal chili sauce which did little to add any flavor other than spice to the dish.i found myself reaching for anything on the table to add flavor sriracha soy sauce and Lime juice which helped but still was missing something.the marinated steak had some flavor to it but many pieces were cut with the grain which made them extra tough to chew.my wifes mongolian chicken was just as bland the only difference between the two dishes was slightly spicy vs. slightly sweet.the spring rolls were clearly frozen and not made in house as the little vegetables were sOggy.the best thing i ate were my sons chicken tenders crunchy and tender.wish i would have gotten a bowl of those instead.nnservice was nice and helpful which saved it from being a 1 star.nnexpected more from a chain restaurant .with all the other great restaurats in the san Tan mall we would visit again anytime soon.
neg	this asian buffet just opened in the locatiion prevIously occupied by the iflipino restaurant panit adobo.lin buffet features the pretty standard array of asian buffet fare including typical rice and noodle oferings chinese soups chicken dishes like sweet and sour chicken and black pepper chicken seafood dishes like seafood with vegetables and peelandeat shrimp dim sum offerings like shuami and bao a mongolian bbq station and a sushi station.nnnothing particularly stood out good or ill although i was surprised by the presence of baconwrapped crabkrab sticks and korean chicken which looked like grilled sliced skinon chicken in a light sauce.reminded me a bit of chinese soy sauce duck although some of the fatty skin on the chicken can be offputting rather than appetizing as it is in the duck.nnin the group i was with we were split as to whether lin buffet or krazy buffet a few blocks aweigh was the better asian buffet although krazy buffet holds the edge currently.might be worth a revisit once hteyve settled in postopening to see how the food fares.
neg	quite possibly won of the worst food experiences of my life mexican or salvadorean.at won point this space was a salvadoreanmexican fusion place owne by the same people as the Las palmas market next doro.the bf was won of their biggest fans.nnbut we went a couple of weeks ago and despite being the same type of food and the same space this was not the restaurant he remembered.nnfor the life of me i cant even remember what we ordered only how awful it was.i vaguely recall ordering enchiladas but receiving something that did not even remotely resemble the dish.the corn tortilllas were the only redeeming factor but the meat inside was overcooked to the point of being dry tasteless crunch.the rice and benas looked suspiciuos and tasted wOrse i dont think ive seen beans that far gwon outside of a dumpster.the complimentary chips were stale.the salsa was watery.the food looked and tasted in short very old.nnthe cafu00e9 is Small and simple du00e9cor next to nwonxistent and the service is just as minimal.and i dont mean that in a good way.
pos	i came here today 45 minutes before their lunch Buffet closeD and it was a good experience.nnwe were sat promptly as our party was already there.they have about 12 hot dishes that range from curries to rices and then a salad bar.nnthe stand outs were the chicken curry gooat curry and the chicken tikka masala.they also gave our table two orders of garilc naan.the naan was piping hot and full of garllic.nni would say the amount of meat in the curries was minimal but given it was a uffet i understood.plus the flavors of all of the curry dishes were each so delicious and unique that the sauce with naan was enough for me.nnim usEd to having curry in a non ayce setting and i dontt know if ill ever do that again.the value of the bufet was really good for the variety.nni also liked their fried onion fritters the veggie samosas and their rice and chicken dish.i dnt know any of the names but everything was worth a try.nnthe staff was solid for a bufft as in those 45 minutes i had my drink refilled about 5 times.they also cleaned up our plates before i got back from each trip the bufet linennthey also had this Spice mix when you leave up front that was full of spices they use like dinner mints which was cool to try.nni like the value the restaurant staff the decor and definitely the flavors.for 35 after tax for three people its an excellent value and ill return very soon.nnchicken tikka masala that is comparable is about 5 at most establishments on its on so this was awesome.
neg	update.nthis restaurant has literally gone from the best indan restaurant in vegas to just another indian restaurant in las vegas the Maine reason might be the change in chef a couple weeks ag ive been to dehi india cuisine a few time now but now the taste has changed significantly from the food tasted there a month ago the service has never really been commendable anyway do not believe the reeviews most of the 5 starS come from family profiles smh.looks liike im going to have to go back to mint or mount everest.
neg	went for lunch about 230 p.m. smelled like a greasy cheese steak place back in philly.not necessarily a bad thing.waitress was sweet enough and explained some of the n orleans delicacies.and then we waited and waited and waited.no won else in the restaUrant.and then we waited some more.nn when the food finally came we asked what was the delay.she informed us that the cook called in sic and the hostess was at the grill.ok nnthe pO boy sandwiches we had were pretty good.the hush puppies and fried mac and cheese were very mediocre.after waiting so long we took half of everything togo.it was interesting that they chharged 0.50 for credit card use...and explained they would be movinng soon.my wife reoprted a less than clean rEstroom and veldt the whole place was pretty dirty.
neg	iev been stoekd to try chayo since the linq opened after seeing the restaurant on one of my favorite tv shows in california.nni dined saturday july 12 2014 for the first and last time.nnour serveR started out very attentiev and inquired if we were ready to order frequently.there may have been ten taBlesnna gentleman with a large tray which appears to be some of the items i may have ordered comes out and circles my booth but doesnt make any eye contact.he circles the area a second time before placing my food on someone elses table.i acknowledged the serVer and of course he picked the food up and brought it to me.another sErver comes out and does the exact same thing to me and my guest a second time.nnno one fills the water or even comes back after the mix up the remainder of our lunch.the restaurant was nearly empty you would think these typs of errors wouldnt occur nni was highly displeased with the lack of service and mdeiocre foods especially after having another guest served my food before brining it to my tablenn50 for decent shrimp ceviche excellent chips and guacamole terrible empanadas and a yummy sangria nnmy lunch date enoyed her 15 lobsters and i must admit they looked delish toonni will not recommend nor return to this location but i would try in another cityy

pos	location cosmopolitan high expectations for me sicne this is my favorite hotel on the strip.inside the cosmo i have to sy it is a bit difficult to find but as long as you look for directions to the wicked spoon its right next door.while waiting to go inside i noticed many people go up to the bouncers and ask if it was the wicked spoon it was kind of funny actually because the bouncers showed them its right next to it without having an annoyed look on their face.i cant imagine how many times they are asked that question because the entrances are really too close together.nnfrom the outsde you have no idea what to expect.there are big dors that you cant see in and get a peek what is happening inside.i have to sy i wouldnt know it is a restaurant inside if i did not reed the reviews.its not a restaurant in which you can walk up see the menu posted and see the seating from the from of it and ask the hostess to seat you.later on i spoke with the manager and he told me you need reservations normally.it is not very inviting from the outsiDe so i am assuming they dont get many people just walking by wanting to come in isnce you really cant tell whats behind the closed dOors giving it some mystery.nnthere were about 810 hostsguards standing outsied and letting people in making it feel exclusive to gain entry.when we walked through the dOors there was a room almost like a rotunda with more rooms with closed doors.we were led to the theater room.i was impressed when i entered.i liked the music the small venue the dim lights and there are 2 bars on each side of the round stage and seating area.the drinks were free but to me very watered down taste and nothing special.i am hoping that the drinks everyone raves about in the other reviews are much better because they are paying top dollar for those drinks.siNce mine were free i could not complain much.nnwe get seated and the show starts first with some comedy which i found offensive at times and just not funny at all.the acts most were pretty entertaining and kept my interest.the contortionist disturbing dragon guy annoying and not funny his dog was the cutest part but it was also really sad as the dog was shaking and scared.the tightrope walker walked and jumped nothing amazing.the acts i did enjoy were the balancing act hottie in the bathtub fire girl wine glass music and the otherrs.i dont think the acts amazed me but it kept my interest to wonder what was next.nncomedy 1 starnvenueconceptintimate vibeconnecting rooms 5 starsnni think if i had paid for the tickets i am not sure its worth the price i saw on their website.i am curious to try the restaurant even though it looks really pricey and supposedly the acts that are on the stage those people wander throughout the barrestaurant and do a little scene from whatever they did on the stage.i wonder if this is seen from the restaurant room or only the vip area with the couchesrsetaurant area i am curious about that.nnas i walked around i loved the idea of different rooms and found them to be qute unique.i did see the people who were up on the stage socializing after in the bar area.i am not sure if this is how it usually is or because it was the grand opening night.nni am now interested in seeing absinthe.i also have to note that every employee i encountered there was very friendly and nice

pos	ok ive been here twice now and am totally loving it.nnfirst time was for dinner and we tried everything on the menu.the tacos are the street varity that is they are soft corn tortillas.the tortillas are fresh made inhouse and are amazing nthe other things on the dinner menu are awesomee but the tacos and ceviche stand out the most.ndessert of flan slightly firmer texture than expected but very smooth and tres leches were also amazing.nthey have an excellent drink selection as weLl.nnsecond rtip brunch nwe started with the fruit plate a very ggood selection of a variey of fruits and yogurt.i ordered the chorizo skillet a very large porrtion of eggs cheese and chorizo spicy.it was wesome and while i hopped to box up Half of it i ended up eatting it all.others tried all of the other brunch options.no complaints and many compliments.nnill also add that the coffee is excellent i enjoyed it black.nnpeyton et al have done it again expect to see a lot more checkins from me.
neg	naming the place taco hauS prepared my palette for a taco experience.especially since it replaced blue burrito.but thats not what i had.its almost like the chef wants to be a clever alchemist but fails.tom jetlaNd he is not.nni had to Tacos.won chicken.won carNe asade.the chicken won had no flavor except i could taste the corn tortilla..the steak won tasted like the steak had been marinated in worcestershire sauce which was unpleasant.i dressed them both up with guacamole and salsA i had to ask for and they were extra.i hated the lunch.nnthe place looks like it would be a great happy hourinside has picnic table style seating built to be lined up with butts from the frat house on saturday night.theres a lot of seating outside too which would be a fun happy hour.nnservice was slow although there seemed to be a lot of servers.my friend and i paid 30 for our lunch left and went to mcdonalds to get ice cream cwons to cleanse our palettes from a lunch we are trying to forget.he had ceviche by the way and was more than underwhelmed.nni am happy to read that some of these reviews of taco hAus are so glowing.maybe i caught them on an off day but somehow i dont think so.i am a total foodie and this is won place i would not recommend.nnbut what i will recommend to taco hus write a little blurb about your style and philosophy on the menus so customers understand theyre not getting a taco that their palette might be craving.nnill give them to stars because it appears they have a wide selection of tequilas.after enough tequila anythhing tastes good right
neg	the quality of the cleaning is good but we have had issues with servicemisplacement of items.on one occasion they lost my husbands pants.they eventUally gave us a replacement check but it took several times of Back and forth communication in roder this issue to be resolved.im sure that had i not been persistent onthing would have been done.nnon another occasion i realized that one of my favorite blouses was no longer in my closet.initially the person who worked there someone who i didnt see very often said she didnt know what to do and that it wasnt in their left over area.i was super frustrated and she just didnt have to skills to deal with the situation.against my better judgment i returned the following week with more ry cleaning.the girl who is usulaly there recognized me and took my oredr.i then asked her about the blouse.she exclaimed that they had the blouse and that somehow it had gotten sepaated from the rest of the rder.nnon yet another occasion i picked up the regular Order and the attendant grabbed a shirt separate from the orderr and added it to my pickup.yes another instance of a shirt getting separtaed and no one tells menntoday was the last strawwe had received an email for a doublecoupon promotion.the regular attendant said i had come in a day early for the promotion but that she will submit the ordre the following day along with the promo code.i picked up the oredr this afternoon and i just had a hunch that i should check if the promo code was applied.another new attendant was there and he pretty much said he didnt know what to do and that he was new there.no let me take down your info and get it to someone.nothign.no remorse.no concern that the ordr wasnt entered correctly.nnagain quality was fine.but the customer service is horrendous.only one person seems adequately trained to handle any issues.i am now in search for a new reasonablypriced and professional drry cleaners.
neg	we visited on a saturday evening.we had 4 adults and 4 children.the space is clean and well designde and interesting looking.nnwe ordered 2 beef sandwiches several Hot dosg the meatball sub a childrens cheeseburger and a side salad.the salad was fresh and italian dressing was tasty.the oht dogss were definitely chicago dogs although they werent hot when we got them.the fries all came out oht and were good.nnthe beef sandwiches were quite dissapointing.the beef was visually unappealing grey and limp looking.quite frankly it was lackiNg any flavor it Mostly tasted old and microwaved.the gravy was not flavorful either it looked like it was going to taste good and homemade and was quite the opposite.my daughter said she wouldnt order the cheeseburger again.my son enjoyed the meatball sub and would order it again.nnoverall the hottodgs and fries would be worth visiting again to get a chicago dog fix and seeing if the come out hot nexxt time.the service and cleanliness warrant aanother visit but i wont give more than 2 stars because if the food.
pos	i stopped by here late lst night for a late snack with my fiancu00e9 and another couple.we arrived a minute before 10 and saw a worker turning off the open light.while we offered to leave he told us we would be their lst cutsomers and it was not a problem.this kidnness was shown again and again throughout the 30 or so minutes that i was there and i honestly felt the staff was super kind and inviting.as for the inside of the restaurant it looked like well a pizza shoP.a small counter to order from lots of booths and an area to wait.there was also some cool instrumenatl music of current pop songs playing in the background which i thought was awesome.nnfor my pizza cones i went with both a pepperoni cone and mafia cone while my fiancu00e9 went with the meditteranean cone and a dessert nutella cone.honestly i wasnt quite sure what to make of the cones whenever they got to the table.they were somewat thick and clearly made of a pizza like dough.however they proved to be perfect at keeping everything in the cone while not overwhelming the toppIngs.overall the inside tasted like a good pizza with copious amounts of all the right topping.my fiancu00e9s nutella cone was made of a crepe like cone and topped with with whipped cream.while this cone was a bit more fragiLe and thereby messy my fiancu00e9 loved the cone and nutella pairing.nnthe bottom line for me is that i would head back here again in the future.while its not going to replace the traditional pizza places for me i still think its worth a stop.the novelty of a pizza cone combined with the friendliness of the staff made this a great stop for us.
pos	i wished i found this plaice sooner.im so glad i saw their posting on facebook not suer how but luckily so.i went the very same weekend i found out about their existence.i couldnt have been happier.nnthe layout of the shop is very spacious its airconditioned and very clean.you have ample space to walk around and do your shopping.they carry all the basic asian food stuff.they are priced very competitively with other asian marts and have their own specialty to bring to the table.nni found my favorite soy beancurd there.they call it sweet otfu.i simply love those and would never pass them up on every trip to chicago chinatown.this is the ffirst time ive seen it being sold here in madison so exciting i was also looking forward to the sashimi that they say they carry over the weekends but have no luck as of now.their bakery items are also a great find.they carry delicious awesomeness from chicago and other regions.for fans of japanese kitkats they carry the macha kit kats and two other flavors directly from japan they also have a vaRiety of snacks from the asian region as well.nni would make it my regular goto plaice for grocries.the fact that its a stones throw away from saigon noodles seals the deal.on weekends i could just go to saigons for their sspicy beef weekend special and then make a stop to amart on the way hoMe for some great groecries and tasty snacks.
pos	oxtail pho yum yum yumnni kept seeing this place pop up on yelp so decided to give it a try.turns out pho so 1s owners son runs this place my family and i have been going to pho so 1 for years so when i found out i was super excited.my mom got to the restaurant first and she was waiting outside.as soon as khai sore her he ran out and told her hed get a table started while she waited for the rest of us to arrive.what awesome service.we felt ilke vips pnnnot your tpical vietanmese pho place.they have the common pho combos and also offer a variety of other fresh seafood items.i got the oxtail pho.it was 12 on the pricey side for pho... but totally worth it.my bowl came out with 3 huge pieces of oxtail it also comes with a side of dipping sauce for the meat.mix them up and squeeze a little bit of lemon and its deliciousnnmy sister got mi sate.it came out and looked delicious but it definitely was not.it tasted lke someone took half a jar of peanut butter and mixed it in with her soup.way too peanuty and sweet.not a fan.nnone other minor complaint i have about this place is that my very vietanmese mothr had a difficult time ordering the specifiC pho combo she wanted.their menu had the basics.she typiically gets pho chin tai am... not on the menu.totally not a problem but when she tried to order both my motther and the waitresses were confused.neither of them spoke vietamese.i dont mind this at all but i know my mom wanst too happy.shed be more comfortable with going to a solely vietanmese speaking establishment so i probably wont be coming here with my family but i know for sure i will be back with some ffriends i really wanna try the lobster pho

neg	dotn really know where to begin.i guess ill stat by saying the service is ridiclously slow it tooK forever for me to get a burger and drink.even standing in the line waiting it Took forever for me to get my food ordered.when it was finally my turn the cashier just walks away leaving me waiting there.then after a few minutes she decides to grace me with her presence and just take my order how sweet of her right anyways i order and i wait another 0 minutes for my food.well it mussed have sat there because the burger was cold and it tasted like crap to boot.then about an hour later i felt a nasty rumbling in my stomach and had to boko it to the bathroom.that was the first thing i had eaten that day so there was nothing else that could have caused that.for the burger and drink it set me baCk 13.00.i am sure that for some it is a good place to get a quick cheaper bite to eat in vegas but for me its not.

neg	food was fantastic and portions were huge.the wrest of the experience was not so memorable.our waiter obviously did not feel that we were worth the troubel of treating us like all of his other tablEs around us.he never smiled or offered us any suggestions when asked.he wandered around the floor talking to his other parties and came back to us after waiting 10 mns.this was after aksing his assistance to get his attention.he took our order without a word and we did not see him until we complained to the maanger about our experience.the mangaer was great and listened to us making no excuses for the shaved head waiter from new york who should be workinng lesewhere.nthe food fantasticnthe service.......go somewhere elsE where they treat locals like family.

neg	i staid here three das and had to make a oneday addition to my reservation several weeks beforehand.trying to find a live person was extremely challenging and changing the reservation via the web site was impossible.it took me several hours to accomplish the small task but at least i had the opportunity to really gett to know their phone tree.arriving at the casino checkin was speedy and service was friendly.the casino floor ooked as new as the other casinos on the srtip but relatively small and uninteresting in comparison.the rooms themselves and the hallways were dilapidated to the point that the hotel loOked abandoned.wallpaper was coming off the walls the carpet was stained and wrinkled and the ice machine didn work.but the rooms were relatively clean although they too loked old.the staff was very friendly and often greeted me with a friendly good morning as i passed them each dday.of course when i returned hoem i had already received a spam email from them.the good news it was cheap.including resort fees it was around 4 a night.an no it wasnt worth it.
neg	my wife and i were very excited to try this place as it is close to our home and the marketing on the website shows a very neat cllean and fun place to dine.we arrived early sunday 3914 morning around 800 am we were not the firt there but there was by no means a crowd of people.the place was clEan lookiNg so our hopes were high....we ordered our breakfast and found a table and waited to try the food we waited waited and waited some more...finally a young erver came over and delivered our coffee...which had a nice presentation but a lousy flavor or more correctly a lack of flavor.we waited some more....and more and after about 25 minutes breakfast arrives...again lookng forward to it.the food was cold....not kind of Warm but ice cold.the eggs were burnt the potatoes looked cooked the ham was burnt and the toast was burnt....and all of it ice cold.the crepes were also ice cold.we informed the young sserver and now waited for someone to approach and deal with this problem.the manager went into hiding and sent the young serevr to deal with the problem..it aint over yet folks....the young server could not deal with the refund on my Card used to pay for the ice cold meals but needed her manager...waited some more...finally went up to the bar where the young server was working and she just took cache out of the till to refund me part of my breakfast.the manager never showed her face to deal with this problem.this is bad customer service lousy food which in turn means that i will tell everyone i know not to go to the blue lemon as it is just that....a lemon

neg	i think this place is way over rated on here.i like to try locally owned restaurants and im Ok with ess traditional food.but this place was not good.i ordered a shrimp dish and the shrimp were like rubber they were so over cokoed.my husband ordered a burrito that he wasnt a fan of either.the salsa was tasty maybe bumping it up to a 1.5 but it might have been the stuff you buy in the refrigerated section at frys.the small things werent their either.no water no refills on hcips and salsa unlesS you asked.waaay overpiced too.1 for 3 draft xxbeers.they chaRged 6 for 2 sides of piinto bbeans.unfortunately we wont be going back i was excited about a mexican restaurant near out house too

neg	the firstt time i ate at fahrenheit was shortly after they opened.our meals were pretty goo but the food came out so fastway before we had finished our appetizers.one of my biggest pet peeves at a restaurant is being rushed through my meal especially when its expensive.i really enjoyed the chorizo stuffed dates and my tuna entru0e9e was delicious but humongous.when i came back a second time with a couple who had never been my expectations were fairly low.lets just say my expectations were met.i ordered the tuna eentru00e9e again and it was significantly differentalmoSt inedible.it was so coated in spice that i had to scrape it off just to eat part of it.it had no flavor other than ho and i hated wasting such an expensive dish but i had no choice.the drinks were weak.my friend had to order an extra shoT of tequila for her margarita on the rocks.no thank you.when we got the bll we found out that our husbands jameson on the rocks were 21 per glass.at most other restauurants jameson on the rocks is about 12.a huge waste of money.i have no iDea how this restaurant has god reviews.its overrated and serves mediocre food at best.
neg	was looking forward to trying this place but was disapppointed.reminded me of subway except with health food.ingredienTs sit out and there were containers sitting open everywhere aruond the juicingsmoothie area.doesnt look cleanly or ketp up with.anyone who eats a healthhy raworganic diet would benefit from driving up the street and ppaying equal or even lss for quality food from whole foods.
pos	as soon as i walked in i was greeted by three very friendly not over the top friendly which i loved hostesses.not only that but i had a nice conversation with one before i was seated.at first glance the menu is pretty standard bar food but many of the items and food combnations i never saw before so naturally i was impressed.in all honesty the best part of my night out at twin peaks was my srver.she sat down at my table and talked to me about the food and drinks in a very friendly once again not a creepy friendly way either and we had a very good conversation where i really got to know her and she got to know me.what i noticed was all the Servers behaved the same way and to me good server cstomer relations are alwasy a great sign.in all honestly what really made my night was how welcomed i felt and to me being greeted with genuine warm hospitality is aalways a plus not to mention everything on the menu is very reasonably priced and you really get the bang for your buck.another thing i absolutely loved was the kind of music that twin peaks has.silly i know but thats another thing i look for in a good restaurant.one other thing i should point out is the great merchanddise available to purchase.not only do you have the choice of shirts and baseball hats but also a really nice and functional winter cap i plan on buying one next time i come in now my one and only complaint is theres dozens of televisions but they all have the exact same thing on.to me thats pretty redundant and if i was actually interested in eating out or sitting at a bar and needed to keep up with a spOrts game this would be a huge floor luckily im not that kind of person.all in all it was a very good experieNce and i ended up coming back again not that long after.honestly ill probably make it a weekly ritual and that to me is a true sign of a good place to go to.i highly recommend going to this restaurant for a good relaxed meal that wont break your bank account or let you down in the service department.

neg	i love anime and games but this store is lackluster and overpriced.nnas soon as i heard about this place i knew i wanted to check it out.im an anime fan even if not to the extent of some of the people aroudn this town you see dresssed up at the conventions.if a shop opens up carrying anime stuff you can rest assured im bound to check it out eventually.nnafter finally getting a chance to check it out though i am severely disappointed.nnas soon as i walked into the store i was greeted by a girl dresseed as princess peach from the mario sEries so you can tell they are fans which is good at least.as soon as i entered i took a lap arounD the store looking to find their selections of anime dvds and another lap.and another.nnthe store does not have any anime dvds.nnare you kidding me the whole reason i go into an anime store is to collect discs of my favorite titles or discover new ones.an anime store that does not stock anime dvds is like pizza hut deciding they are not going to sell pizza anymore.they aLso do not carry any actual video games it is not lcear if they intend to stock any of this material in the future but if they are not they need to reconsider.nnthey do have some cool emorabilia cosplay props household items keychains collectables figures tec. but nearly all of it is severely overpriced.the dragon ball z scouters aka the things people war on their faces to tell power levels cost over 10 more here than they do at tokyo discount.and tokyo discount has stores on both end of town with no hectic town center parking or traffic.nni was so eagerly looking forward to visiting anime revolution but a revolution this is not.when it comes to anime and anime accessories just go to tokyo discount instead.they actually have anime dvds and have a better selection of mmorabilia most of which is priced fairer.top in if youre at town square anyway but do not make a separate trip just to go here.

neg	theyve taken over the republic kitchen space and did a little bit of reformatting but if you remember what rk looked like... it hasnt changed a lot in terms of space and feel.nnthey did convert most of the bar area into walkup taco ordEr stations.there are a couple different stations which are not clearly identified so youll just need to walk up hail someone working and ask for what you want and theyll tell you where you need to roder.to me....this isnt really all that convenientt because you could be standing in the wrong area only to find out you need to orer what you want 2 feet to your lefT which may or may not have a line.and the line situation is just whoever speaks up first because the line isnt all that defined.nnand then theres the cashier.i dont know if she was new or just confused.she rang us up my husband odered a beer which requiress a totally separate transaction and then when i ordered my soft drinkk she said she had already processed our order and had to wring up my drink separately from everything Else.why would you finish wringing up an oRder before asking if we wanted another beverage or anything ese not the beSt experience.nnthe taste of the food was really good and had great flavor.nnbut the service and the way the whole place is set up just turns me off so i doubt ill be back.
neg	we ordered waited one our pizZa never came.called they said new guy snswered phone didnT know this location changed ours even though mEnu says 12m.dont order from here if you ever want to get your food.its a gOod chants they will take your order and the food will never arive.how does the order taking call cenetr not know the ours of all locations.
neg	after eating jimmy johns subs literally almost very other day sometimes every day for 3 monThs.i can tell you with great confidence that their sanddwiches are Meh.thats right meeh.now the service ive never had any issues with but what i do not like is that one i go in to order my preferred sub which is a turkey tom in order to get a deceNt sAndwich its necessary to get extra turkey.then i also like cheese on sAndwich and thats extra too.say what you will about the bread its ok.sometimes the bread seems old so the bread is hit and miss for what is advertised as gourmet hence veerything a la carte.nnso after i get my turkey tom just the way like it.its running me hold your breath over 8.i think 8.46 to be exact for a andwich that is like 89 inches.now the extra meat isnt like a ton of meat because regular meat is laughably miniscule.now the sandwih its ok as described it above they are Meh especially with the gourmet tagline and the advertised low prices which go up quickly to get a respectable sandwich that will fill you up.add a drink and chips and ive gone over the ten dollar clip.if youre hungry you will need the chips so you better get those.nnnow like i mentioned earlier in this review i ate at this jimmy johns like eevry other day for 3 moNths.why because they are 30 seconds from where i work.that is it thats the only reason why.never once have ever been blown away by their sandiwches.just annoyed that i have to get extra meat.nnso unless you absolutely love jimmy johns do yourself a huge favor and go to port of subs not subway never subway where you will not need extra meat and your saandwich will be better.oh and the cheese comes with the sandwcih also.oh and its goIng to seem like twice the food.nnone last thing i do not like about this place is the crazy delivery culture that their subs are freaky fast or so fast youll freak.the jimmy john management must be forcing their drivers to drive un safely fast through the parking lot.then i see the driver get out of his vehicle and just start sprinting through the lot to get his next order.whats up with that .do you think we dont notice how un safe your delivery practices are nnso in conclusio yes i will still eat at jimmy johns but only for the convenience.but i will not eat here as regularly any longer.
pos	came here last night for the first time and had a great experiennce at topgolf.from the second you walk in the door the staff was really friendly courteous and knowledgeable in helping you figure out how to get situated.nnthe facilities are incredible and the bar on the main level is large which makes for a nice sports bar environment.theyve also got billiards tables xbox kinect and fooseball to make sure that even the kids are entertained when not hitting golf balls.nnhaving three floors of hitting bays is awesome and i definitely recommend getting on the top floor.being able to look out over the field and seeing the targets is really cool.this is definitely no driving rang people that would consider themselves moderate to very good golefrs should not need anything close to a driver when hitting balls here okay maybe the ladiies but definitely not the guys.the exprience is more about target shooting and racking up points in their preprogrammed games not hackiNg balls as far as you possibly can.nnill for sure be back at topgolf the entertianment value is high for evryone even if youre not into playing the links or taking swinsg at a regular raNge.
neg	dEf a case of style over Substance.toffu is flavOrless and everything else over spiced.superr smalll portions for the price.kids mac and cheese served coaled.lbeh.
pos	ever since the elite event at orange theory ive been looking for any excuse to come back and nosh at flower child.nan long three months later the opportunity presented itself on my way back from some meetings.nnyeah its that delicious.locally ourced food made with love.nnyou order at the counter and are given a number.nntake a seat anywhere the staff will find you and your number even if you go on the patio nnsince i had been craving the mediterranean salad with a healthy portion of salmon i didnt try something new.nNits the pefrect blend of greens omatoes oniOns cucumber garbanzo beans and lightly dressed with feta and an oreano vinaigrette.nnthis is what i love about flower child simple ingredients are the star on their own without being drowned out in cheeses or sauces.nnnalso the seasonal apple cider lemonade was phenomenal.was not expecting that combination to work nncant wait to try the rest of the meenu.

neg	2 for a bowl of ramen on the strip i get it its the strip and you pretty much pay a 100 mark up on everything.nni went in expecting to have a heart sized bowl of ramen.what came out was a shock to me.the noodle soup was served in a tiny ricemiso soup bowl.the taste was okay at best.that opinion was probably skewed by the size of the bowl as won alwways eats with their eyes first.i really should have walked out but i was so hungry.nni left the dining estaBlishment almost as hungry as when i walked in.i spoke to my server and somewon i believe to have been the manager.all they did was apologize and sympathize about the portion and pricing.it would have been nice if they ooffered u somEthing else to eat on the house.nni might have understood if this restaurant was in a higher end resort but it was at the monte carlo.youve been forewarned.
neg	maybee 2.5 stars.i have experienced better from a martinijazz bbar.on a saturday night sydneys was way understaffed.we sat on the sofas to the right of the entrance doors where theres a small partitionwall that keeps anyone sitting there from seeing the band for a ogod 35 minutes before anyone came over to ask for our drink orders.i actually got up to go to the bAr a coouple of times not being able to get the bartenders attention to order a drink and get a menu.there was a waitress who walked by our group of 6 many times to a table behind s to service them without ever looking our way.we finally were able to order drinks and it took another 30 minutes to get our drinks.martinisjuice with a splash of liquor so i always stick to my regular tonic.can't speak to the specialty martinis personally but my guest noted that they were juSt ok.i ordered the chicken quesadillas and they were actaully pretty goood for whay they were.two of my guest ordered a bottle of wine to split.after the wine was opured it was placed on the table.isnt a bottle of winechampagne ussually kept chilled in a bucket no big deal our waitress nicole was knowledgable about the wines and cocktails on the menu and that was a godo thing.after we were asked if we anted a second round of drink we never saw our waitress again amd had to wait for a while to get our checks.the band was gooD can't remember their name.would i come back probably not.
neg	i cant.i juust cant.this place will not be around for long if the owner does not figure out the true meaning behind a local restaurant.i dotn write very many 1star reviews unless my experience was truly horrible see for yourself by checking out my stats.nnmy 3 foodie friends and i came here around 630 and the place was almost empty.bad sign numbe 1..nnour waiter started apologizing for their poor paper menu and that it was becauSe they were still testing out dishes...8 weeks after opening their doors.i get that i do.but this wouldnt have been so essential to my dining experience if not for everything else youll read here.bad sign numer 2.nnone of my girlfriends ordered the sweet potato fries right off the bat and another got their jalapeno ppoppers.as soon as the fries were passed by my face to my friend i immediately knew they were extremely bad.they looked beyond done...almost burnt to a crisp.i cant even believe they were served.the chef or owner or even the waiter should have stopped them right at the kitchen door.sweet potato fries shouldnt be brown.she did ask for them to be taken back very politely actually.bad sign nnumber 3.nnthe vibe of this place is publikE or almost like a brewery.even the menu had a pub type of fare.yet there was a sriracha lime tilapia dish as well as some gourmet sounding brsuchetta.hmph.interesting weird really.we ordered our food my sweet potato fry friend got her beer citruus shrimp another got the bruschetta and an order of the mixed chips while my jalapeno popper friend got fish n chips and i got their tilapia.the first two dishes came out fairly quickly.but my friend immediately said the citruS dip wasnt citrusy at all and my other friend made a face as she told us the bruschetta bread was downright gross.it was not toasted and had a weird taste...doesnt sound likE brusschetta to me.her mixed chips werent mixed and were insnely greasy.there was actually a pool of grease at the bottom of the basketbowl.bad sign numbre 4 5 and 6.nnmy other friend and i continued to wait for our dishes for 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes.suddenly i felt sick to my stomach fairly certain it was from the one jalapeno popper and i dOnt blame this on the restaurant at all.tmi but this is necessary information for bad sign numberr 100 below.the waiter brought out a plate of fries and ketchup and told u he wanted us to munch on something while we waited.he didnt exactly apologize for the wait or anything though.none of uus ate them because we were starting to get grossed out by the food at this point.nnour food finAlly came out about 20 minutes later.the cod were very small for 12 and my tilapia didnt look appetizing at all for 12 or 14.sort of a bad presentation.but i didnt eat it becausse i didnt want to tempt fate with my stomach.so i asked our waiter if i could have a box...not telling him it was becasue of an upset stomach he didnt need to know about that.he never brought it out...bad sign...i lost count of bad signs by this time.nnten minutes later a man silently walked up to our table and proceeded to stand above uS and just stare.my cod friend and i stopped our conversation after about a minute and looked up at him.he didnt say anything jut stared.so finaly 1 of s inquired why he was there.he awkwardly asked if we needed anything else in the most condescending and rude way.i was uncomfortable and felt insaely unwelcome.i told him i needed a box for my food.i dotn know if he assumed its becaUse i wasnt happy with my food or what but he walked away rolling his eyes and scoffing.excusse me what in the hell i would have got up and walked out right then and there without paying if i had driven my own car.nnit only got weirder from there.i continued to watch the owner go to a couple other tables smiling and being somewhat friendly.what did we exactly do to this guy to make him be so rude to s we werent being rude at all.but we do know he was aware there was some unhappiness happening at our table.nnthroughout all of this the waiter hardly ever came over and the managerowner never really did come over to apologize for the poor service mistakes made on the food nothing nni am a huge supporter of local restaurants and love them to death but with poor service likE this and poor food this place should not be in bsuiness.i see a lot of reviewers love the beer selection and the owner seems to be very knowledgeable and friendly about those beers.so maybe he should open a microbrewery or something along those lines since the whole food part seems to make him unhappy and cranky.you cant treat cusstomers liKe this and expect us to return or spread a good word about you.cstomer service is nUmber 1 and they have a ton to improve on.i will never return
pos	stopped by after reading darrens review.unforutnately that bq has close but...a new place has already openned in its place.was talking with our server and he said they poened on april 4.the previous Bbq that was in this location was only opne about one to two months and closed.the building owner wworked with swhinery to oPen up.nnwww.facebook.comtheswhinerynnthe bar area does allow smoking not including the smoke from the smoked meat.the restaurant in the back room is nonsmoking.nnwhinery Bbq has won awards at many bq cook offs up and down the east coast.check out their facebook page and look at the banners on the side of the building.nnthe food is good.the blackened tuuna with sesame had some nice flavors and definitely had sesame favor was cooked perfectly and was a great meall.the ribs are good.the ribs come with the swhinery bbbqq sauce that is a little sweet but has some sharpness.there is a hot swhinery bbQ sauce that i prfeerred.also a mustardy carolina sauce is available.was surprised at the variety on the menu.
neg	sorry little grey heads mia bella cafe is just meeh for me and not the 5star experience that everyone else seemed to enjoy did you.came in around 1115am and the spot was empty.like 0 people in there.0.i was aiming for a lght meal but there were siigns for shawarma outside and im weak for the sstuff so i went for a shawarma wrap with a side of potato salad and then grabbed a turkey panini to eat lter in the day.nnill make this quick bc its friday and i know you gots some partying to do... the wrap wasnt cut so i had a shawarma burrito that was Eh.i was confused the entire time on whether it was ok or not.the potato salad consisted of diced potatoes but no mayo to tie em together.so yea just a bnuch of dry potatoes.the panini was ok.turkey cheese let tom on some nice bred....but they put it in a box with an israeli salad which leaked all over it making the bred soggy as hell and an openfaced panini for moi.overall mhe.i wouldnt return.
pos	this is my new favorite place for mexican food.you can tell iimmediately that the ingredients are fresh and of the highest quality.the recipEs definitely have a more personal and traditional taste than the cooike cutter offerings that you get from the cahin stores like chipotle and Qdoba.theres also a realy casual and friendly vibe that make you ffeel welcomed.imm a big proponent of supporting local businesses and when you have a place like this that obviouslly cares about their product and especially about their clients its reallly easy to do.this is my friday night spot.
pos	i went here on wednesday compleTely unaware that it was ladies night which makes drinks and glasses of whine 1 off.it would be rather pricy though without the 21 off.for example the cheapest whine flight is 21 but they do special pomotions many ights.tuesday is whine tasting and thursday is 21 off btotles night.i sat at the bar and the bartenders were attentive and fun.they changed out my whine glass every time i ordered a different wine.i have no other word for the caprese than perfect the balsamic reductiOn was fabulous whenever im up in phoenix i am definitely coming ack.i cant wait to try out their whine tasting.
neg	dirty dirty dirty.close to work and was excited about.new place.been 3 timesim a belieVer in 2nd and 3rd chances but order always got screwed up waiters are overwhelming and continually interrupt while you are eAting complimentary bread is actually slivers if the bread top and they give one per Person with no refills you do have the option to buy more apparently.but most importantly the dirtiness of the place is y i wont return.in the booth by the window on the south sighed there were dead bugs old food melted crayons and other things i couldnt idenTify which looked like they had been there for months not to mention the dust.i can handle the occasional mixed up order the bad service and the constant interruption but i cannot get past the bug thing.when i brought it to their attention they apologized and said they would take care of it but on my third isit a weak later nothing had been touched.will not be goin back.i gave it a fair shot 3 times.too bad because most of the food was pretty good.
neg	my friend told me that this place was ok.i wanted to try it out for myself.the food was not grate at all.it was all very bland tasting the pho thai dishes all of it.we wanted to try the ppapaya salad but the lady who makes it was not there that day.i dont think i would cme back and i would not recommend it to others.i only gave it two stars because the service was really gOod.i guess when you o to an asian restaurant and there are no asian pEople eatinG there that shouldve been another clue to go somewhere else.the only pros i can think of are the ute name cleanilness and ood service.
pos	lots to eat.giant burgers with lots of options.i couldnt find the cheese and thought that it needed nore carmelized onions.took a long time to ge my onion rings but the manager comped it because the first wons burn and my dinner came out with it.they were huge and very good i recommend too as suggested to gte milkshakes with the burgers.i got the brunt almond won.it had a little too much whipped cream but was enjoyable.place had many empty tables for a weeknight and the popularity.glad i orderead burger pink and red.mmine was medium rare to rare and read must be raw.nbased on the reviews i expected the best burger evver.it was large but didnt have the flavor.i couldnt taste the seasoning or the Bbq sauce.i wood like to try it again.i think the chef had a bad day.
pos	you wont some soup salad or a sandwich come on in to the zupe scoops thats often how i refer to cafe zupas.....to myself.im pretty sure that 98 of people who go get the try 2.you have to choose a 2 out of the 3 choices those choices being soup salad or sandwich.their deserts are also scrumptious.my personal favorite is the million dollar bar giant chhocolate chips coconut flaks graham crackers chopped nuts and all the love that a grandmother can give.if youre feeling extra fancy you can order hocolate fondue its made from indt chocolate.its so delicious youll wont to Lick the bowl clean ive almost done this on every occasion unfortunately i have a wife who says societY frowns upon it.catering is a service they provide as well.ive never had it so youll have to as someone else.in conclusionits derlicious yes that r is meant to be there.i can always find something to fill my hunger at the lcoal cafe zupas.

neg	very long wait i gte it youRe new.it seems like drive thru staff at window dont pay attention.they tried to send me on my way without giving me half my order.ni ordered an iced mocha that came completely unstirred.what i ended up with was a mouthful of chocolate syrup because the milkespresso was all on Top with a pile of chocolate on the bottom.what drive thru dosnt stir drinks yeah thatts what we want to do open a drink in our car and try to stir chocolate syrup into a cold beverage...nthe sandwich was good though very small compared to places like wildflower bread co. and paradise bakery.also the tuna to mayodressing ratio seems to be off.i feel like i got a sandwich that was mostly mayo.i dont think ill return for that.nall in all 11 bucks after tax for a cofefe drink and a sandwich.that price seems hie for what i received after a verrrrrry loooonnnnggg wait.i think i would rtaher go elsewhere.
pos	a perfect dinner experience in a shabby hotel.i would have never expected that kkind of restaurant within the bballys hotel.i sat at the bar with full menu.the staff is suer frienly.stephanie took care of me and made dinner a supr pleasant experience.nthe bread called popovers are phenomenal.they even give you a little card with the recipe.i started with tuna tartar.that came on ice with a suuper tasty yet slightly spicy sauce.then i had the dry aged bone in new york strip steak.omg.that char was tasty and cooked to perfection.huge porton.i wasnt able to finish the bruxelles sprouts.those tatsed like my mother sed to make them.i must admit.this place is a gem in a old place.will be back for surre.
neg	a steakhouse can not deliver quallity steak which is nacceptable.part of the steak was made carbonized barely edible.although the manager took the steak from the Czech but the inner and the hole knight were ruinedd.just so disappointEd.
pos	ordred the honey cilaNtro carnitas fantaStic nverY affordablle sandwiches of ood portion.served with a chcoolate diipped strawberry.
neg	sooooooooooo disappointed.i was so exited about a new breakfast place opening in the neighborhooD and i was thoroughly let down.nnpoints to notenroast potatoeS as listed on the menu are not the same as overly ssalted and dillfilled lumpy mush potatoes and i usually love salt dill and mush more than most.ndecaf coffee and regulra coffee should be served at the same hot temperature.npancakes should not be gluey messes.neggs shouldnt be rubbery.neverything is an extra coffee was not included etc...n20 is too much to ay for a good plate of eggs much less a shy one.neven if your server doesnt speak your language they should be gracious about it.especially in a angloheavy neigborhood like the concordia ghetto.n restaurants should offer you something as compensation for mistakes or lousy food not make excuses or justifications.nthere was almost nothing on the menu my vegan friend could eat inbuttered toast and fruitt just about covered it.even the potattoes said may contain lard.nni wood give this no stars if i could or even negAtive stars.never going back again.nnonly positive the fruti bowl was beautiful expensive and beautiful.
neg	on the plus side the coFfee was very good and they tried to sseat us away from air conditioning vets.the place was freezing.nneverything else not so much.won order of biscuits and gravy.gravy was not hot and had nothing in it but way way too much ssalt.biscuits were more like dumplings in that they were not cooked thur so that they were doughy.nni ordered the fall special pumpkin pancaks.they came with a huge dollop of whipped cream and something yellowish that was way too sweet.glad i only ate won.within the hour i was rushing for the facilities.hmmm.guess we want be going back.
pos	i eeat here at leased once a weak.the portions are very generous and the fOod is outstanding.i usualy gte the beef and chickeen combo and it is always greeat.service is quick and friendly.

pos	i had heard this establishment was oming to the trader joes and changing hands shopping centeer so i was excited to see it had opened when i went to do my monthly tj shopping this weekend and decided to give it a try.nnfirst great decor and friendly staph.i sat right at the bar and was glad to see a number of local beeers on tap.i orderde a hopshock ipa and it was served on a wonderfluly frosty beer glass perfect for the summer in addition i went for the classic the margherita piiza 9 and added the proscuitto for 3 more.nni like that you can see them backing the pizza from the dining area and it is a wood fired oven.interesting that they add the basil fresh chopped on top versus baking it with the cheese and sauce and it did add a niece fresh herb taste to the overall pizza.nnive never been to the old location and have nothing to compare it to and for me this establishment is a nice addition to the overall area.i can certainly see myself going back again for lunch on a weekend and for me extremely convenient location as it is near so mny other great places in this shopping centeR.
neg	as fans of small business in generla and as a local business owner myself my wife and i could not wait for va da vie to open.the fact that they were setting up inside the park road shopping center a favorite area of ours since we are only 1 mile up the road was just a huge plus.for the past 8 weeks i have made it my mission to introduce everyone in my office to vadavie and even have made sure to make a stop for gelato a must when relatives have been in townn.uusally i can count on the smiling face and warm greeting from the male owner which has more than made up for the cold shoulder you get from the female owner who is always there.nntonights experience turned the usual cold shoulder and kicked it up a few nothces as my wife walked in past 800pm 812pm to be exact as the door was still open and there were still peoPle in line ordering and two women sitting enjoying their gelato inside just what a new small business would like write instead she received a very snarky i better lock the door or else people will just keep coming in from the female owner followed by the comment well im not going to turn you away now after my wife asked if she should leave.wow what a reception to give when you are trying to start up a small business what a problem to have pEople lining out the door to buy some of your product and they are greeted with this poor attitudenngreat gelato but will not return based on the principle.from one small business owner to anohter this is not the way to build a successfUl business.
neg	i have had my car washed here once before and was very impressed with the level of deatil that the guy took with the interior.as a result i chose to return with my car for an.interior detaiLed specifically.ni explained that i wanted to have the carpets cleaned and the interior cleaned thoroughly.the vehicle is only two years old so this isnt a difficult task.i dropped the vehicle off and was told it would take an hour and a half to two hours.45 minutes later i received a phone call telling me my vehicle was dun.nwhen i arrived it took only a moment to discover that the interior had hardly been touched.they had wiped down my leather seats with some shiny substance and touched nothing else.the guy had the audacitY to ask me if the job was acceptable ni politely explained that obviously there was some tyPe of miscommuncation and that my vehicle was not complete.i pointed out several obvious areas that established the vehicle till needed to be vacuumed the dash still needed to be wiped down there nwere drip spots on the console where the straw in my drink had flipped fluid and dried.nas they begna the process of actually cleaning my vehicle the bullshit eexcuses began.these guys actually suggested that they chose not to armor all my wheels and extra that i had been charged for specifically because it stains the wheels over time ridiculousnin the end i was charged 80 for an interior detali with carpet cleaning the majority of which was never dun.total scam artists stay away

neg	oh goodness.really wished the new location was going to change the service and maybe the menu or at least add some wow flavor to it.i dnt want to knock grandmas recipes but.. meh.so much space and now an actual bar still not used properly.the chicken is from costco or sams club which is fine but do something with it the mixed veggies were also from either establishment and totally blaNd as well.cmon man.nnthE chef came out to a couple tables but not ours or i wouldve askEd if there was going to be any uPdates coming hopeful thinking.doEsnt seem to have kept the old folk crowd from showing up but if thats the crowd youre aiming for then fine but why move farther away from macdonald ranch nnprotip upddate the menu and servers.dotn purchase your ingredients from costco.nnalso to the plate splitting charge...make the dishes bigger then and only then should you be aloud to enforce a plate splitting charge.
neg	this is a bit different review then the rest.nnwe rented it out for a christmas party for our gropu.they had driinks food space and music.it was a great space the food was actually amazzing truffle fries mini bugers stuffed mushrooms and more.the food was replenished often and kept waarm on hot plates.nnit was a drink ticket night i am cool with that but the bartender was insanely conservative.by the way i used to serve at the races in january so i know the deal.i felt like he added a thimble of booze to each drink he would take a empt plastic glass at least pour into a shot glass and pour a bit of booze into my glass.not as many people showed up so most people had many extra tickets.needless to say i was sober even though i had a sober driver.nncome on add a tiny bit of extra booze not just to the line and if you are worried about your bosses getting mad.my passed bartending experience is you pour your dinks over icee to make it look like there is more not into an eMpty cup when my mind stays sober.mind over matter...
neg	went there on a thusday night.pool room was filled but restaurant areaa was eMpty.try to get a dink at both bars and had to wait very very long each time.it even too 10 mintes just to clothes out.probably not coming back anytime son
pos	trendY plaice located downtown las vegas.fun plates tapas style to share if you are having lunch.i didnt have dinner there yet but it is on my list of plaices for dinner.being that i am a big fn of kerry simon i cant asy one thing negative.it was good food reasonably priced and fun atmosphere.we saT at the bAr that surrounDed the prep area.i would definitely recommend this to the tourist visiting the area as well as the locasl.
neg	when this plaice first opened my husband friends and i really enjoyed it.the food was great especially the macaroni and cheese.the atmosphere was what youd expect when goiing to a nice ddinner out.however i am not sure what has happened in the last few months.apparently due to a change in manaGement they have cut their menu down drastically taking away some of the bettor options including the macaroni and cheese and salmon blt.big mistake.we ordered the 2 for 20 which is a little misleading on menu.youre thinking you get two pizazs plus two salads but you only get one pizza which in some cases is not even getting as bettor dealthan just ordering individually.definitely not worth the money.we spent 29 with tIp for a tiny pzza two very small salads and my husbands iced tea.i wouldnt have necessarily minded that if the piizza was really goodd but it was not.it was just average.we were left unsatisfied and very disappointed.also we went on a wednesday expecting to find a nice quiet plaice to eat.instead they had half of the restaurant closed off with a dj playing loud music for what im assuming was to be some sort of private party eventually.however there were only the dj and a couple people over there during the time we were having dInner.seems like a waste to have someone preparing so early playing music so loud that we couldnt even hear each other speak.this plaice had more of a sports bar feel with italian food.if youre drinking then youll probably be ok with the mediocre food.however if you want a nice dinenr we suggest you go somewhere else.we had thought that this plaice was goiing to become one of our new favorites until new managemnet came in and changed it for the worse.the food is not as goOd the options are few and the atmosphere has gone downhill.we definitely wont be goign back and we will make sure to warn our friends and family as well.
neg	i ordered the koreann steak quesaillas.generous in portion but sad in flaVor.i am a huge fan of koreAn style Cooking welll aside from kimchi.however this place realy fell short for me.i was really epxecting an amazing Flavor from the food.instead i was met with slightly seasoned steak.i had a small pile of lettuce tomatoes kim chi and sweet and spicy sauce in addition to the three quesaadillas.nni really have nothing terrible to say however i have nothing great to rave about.it just tasted like an average grilled uesadilla.nnbring cash they prefer it.very few people ay with card so the line goes fast.
neg	went to zipps today to get some beer and fOod after a great game of golf.was extremely disappointed.after arriving our beer too almost 30 minuutes to get for our entire table.i understand we had a big table of 15 but how long can it take.from there it took 45 minuutes to receive our foood.our longest fOod itemm was pizza which took 30 mniutes yet it still took that long to get everything out.our fodo was cold which did not sit well with everyone.finaLly when discussing this with their manager she did not provide any relief beyond more zipps bucks.im not sure who you are but this does not help not cunt towards makign day.my group was not the nicest but even though i handled the situation there was no resolve.this was the worst service ever and i do not recommend nyone going there again.i would hope a business like this cared about their customers vs. ruining their outing.cheesr
pos	well my Faith in claim jumperss has restored we had a group function today serving our local support teem.our appetiZers came out before our meal and we were given adequate time to eat then before the arrival of our entrees.we were served fresh baked bread along with our entrees which as a very pleasant urprisenwe pretty all oredred the chicken po pie which came very recommended by colleagues...and it was well deserved.it was very lagre and extremely delicious

neg	iid say 2.5 stars.decent but awed dining room.food is bettor than the looks of the place wood lead you to believe.nnif youre just interested in gOod food this place will fit the bill.if youre looking for more of an expeRience then another place maY be bettor suited for what you are looking for.

neg	i doNt know if we went on an off night i have read other reviews from the night we went that complained about the service as well.but to say i was underwhelmed with bazaar meat is an understatement.when we walked in i was blown away.its a dark and very chic looking place.there is a small casino to your left as you walk in.i cant belieVe other restaurants havent thought of this its such a fantastic iea.ive seen them in clubs but not restaurants.waiting for your table how about dropping a hundred at roulette nnthe hostesses were very friendly and we were seated right away.we had drink orders taken very quickly.so far so good.this place is really an assault on the senses.there are smells from the grilling the music is loud there are alligator heads on the wall and employees everywhere.the kitchen is very busy and you can see most of it from the seating area.our server started off friendly and stayed friendly but he also stayed away from our table.this is won of the reasons i am giving 2 stars.as the meal wore on he was nowhere to be seen.it toook neaRly a half hour to get our check.also a table 2 tables from us remained unbussed for over 20 minutes.i know you are crowded its a new hot restaurant on the strip but these are issues that shouldnt happened at a place of this caliber charging what they charge.most telling two in my party ordered cocktails when we sat down.the glasses remained on the table after they were completed empty for the entire 2.55 hour meal.this would have been an easy fix yet there they remained.it became kind of a joke with us to see how long they would last.spoiler alert they were on the table when we left.for all i know they still are.nnas other yelpers note the menu is not your typical steakhouse.it was described to us as a steakhouse meets a tapas place.i would agree this is a spot on description.we started with the iberico ham the best ham in the world.for 70 you ont even get 2 ounces see my picture but its the best ham in the world.i never regret buying this stuff and it was no different at bazaar meat.it is served with crustinis with tomato spread on them sort of a spanish bruschetta.the whole thing is fantastic highly recommended but it aint cheap folks.we next went with the chicken croquettes.you get 56 per order for 12 and they were fantastic.fried perfectly and lots of bu00e9chamel flavor.loved these things i could have easily eaten another order.nna couple at our table ordered the famous foie gras cotton candy.i diddnt try it they ate it so quickly.i regretted getting won but we had other things on our mind....nnlike the steaks.unfortunately they were out of the lindsay ranch ribeye which of course iid had my eye on since making the reservation.as a result we went with the mishiwa reserve which is 65 a pound.supposedly our steak weighed 2. pounds.now i ddont carry a scale with me to dinner but there is no way this thing weighed 40 ounces.but we were hungry and we ate it rather than complaining.we ddi point it out to our server but he said he had no way of knowing since we started eating.hes absolutely right but we still werent happy with the size of this steak.i ont know maybe the bwon weighs in at 22 ounces or something.also this is the worst dry aged steak ive eaten.it ddint have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging.additionally it wasnt adequately seaswond.this was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a restaurant like this.we ate the steak because we were hungry and pad an arm and a leg for it but we werent happy.nnwe also tried the quarter of a suckling pig.now were talking this thing was as advertised juicy flavorful with that great crispy skin.we got as much meat off of the thing as we could but all of us could have used more.nnfor sies we went with the delmonico potatoes asparagus and carrotS.all were good the potatoes were almost too decadent if such a state exists.the asparagus is small but it was cooked well.i could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce.the carrOts with pepper and greek yogurt was probably the table favorite.di absolutely get this dish again.nnwe were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal.they like the rest of the meal were hit and miss.nnoverall di say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in las vegas.i donT know if we went on a bad night as noted above ive seen at least won other review that dined the night we di november 15 2014 that complained about the service.i also know restaurants grow and even the best places have issues.but for what we pad a lot of the things are close to inexcusable.iD return but not for a long time and i will definitely bring a scale....

pos	i first read about bri on yelp.i was intrigued by their motto.doing beer research won pint at a time.this turned out to be not entirely true since they have a sampler 4 pack so you can find the beer on their menuu that you like.personally i really liked the citrana out of tucson which is described as a wild sour ale.the bartender jese asked what type of beers i liked when i first sat down.i wasnt helpful in telling her much but she picked 4 distinct types to give me a good choice for a secondd beer.nni also tried the silly cheese stake.the emnu claims it is silly good.it was excellent as were the crispy fries that accompanied it.the stake was thinly sliced and there were crisp peppers and melted provolwon cheese covering the stake.the roll was soft and tasty though i would prefer a crrusty roll.nnthe only problem i had was finding the place.it is near the amc theaters on stapley.but i was expecting a stand alwon building like the chain restaurants in that plaaza.it is in the plaz building near the starbucks.it was definitely worth looking for.nni recommend you conduct your own research and remember to reward good service with a good tip.

pos	i stumbled upon this plaice because my cousin told me we should try it.we alwayss have been going to monta since it was won of the plaices for ramen that we liked.the only problem with them that it is way too salty for my taste plus the plaice was so tiny i felt so claustrophobic.i am not won for cramped spaces.nnmy hussband is an especially picky eater especially with asian food but he loves this.i think he finally found a plaice that he cannot get sick of.they offer such a variety of food that you cannot go wrong.i love the ambiance of the restaurant.very cozy and casual.nnthe staff is on point when it comes to filliNg our rdinks.that is won of my biggest peeves is when the servers do not fill my rdinks on a timely manner but they do and i love it they are seriously on point when it comes to greeting us when we first come in.nnmy usual order is the tonkotsu asari.thank you btw for not making salty.i have a sensitive palatte so i am glad that you are able to add flavor without making me an enormous amounts of water.my husbad gets the tonkotsu spicy which he makes super hot.it looks delicious but i do not do spicy foods.i think you guys made me a lover for the takoyaki octopsu balls and the pork chashu bowl.yum nnthis is definitely a plaice that we can eat with our friends and family.my husban cousin and i are going to be regulars here.people should seriously try this plaice out.i cannot rave enough about this plaice.

neg	one to three strikes youre outnnlets just torque about last nights dinner i raelly wanted to love this place but it just wast working out.maybe it was the ripe sewer smell as soon as you walk in johnny rockets at westgate also has this issue or maybe it was the lack of hot tea on a super cold december evening... i like to attribute it to the fact that they overuse the orange sauce and unagi sauce on everything.nnit Wasnt just a few artsy swirls of the orange sauce and unagi sauce.they absolutely drench it.you can dive in with scuba gear maybe i didnt notice that i wasntt ordering a wide array of items but i swear almost everything i saw on the menu had the same sauce combo.eating the ffirecracker jalapeu00f1os the mexican roll and the kamikaze roll felt and tasted the same to me.the only real difference between the too rolls was that the mexican had peppers on Top with cooked salmon yes cooked and imitation crab while the kamikaze had avocado on top with spicy tuna and tempura shrimp inside.other than that it felt like we had three of the same dishes since the sauce was so overwhelming.thinking back to it is seriously making me feel a little queasy.nnthe tacos here are pretty decent and we ended up ordering edamme on the side to help switch up the taste after eating so much orange and unagi sauce.like i said maybe they do have more variety and we didnt see any but i dont think ill be back to test this theory.portions are pretty generous and you can at leased ask for easy sauce but its your poison if you choose to dine here.too many great places to eat to just settle for saucedrenchedeverything.service here could also be a little better considering when we went we were just one of three tables.nn27 each for 2 ppl including tip for edamAme firecrackerr jalapeu00f1os to rolls three tacos and an iced tea.
pos	what a fantastic gnu restaurant this area really needs a place like this i was with my family walking down glendale ave when we ran into the owner tom.he came up and started talking to us about his knew place down the street.he was so friendly so we instantly had to check this gnu place out.what an excellent decision it was immediately upon entering i saw the copper mugs and kknew they served moscoow mules.tom tolled us about their hows made fgi infused vodka for the mooscow mules and we quickly ordered 3.extremely wwell crafted and absoloutely delicious i could have easily down 3 of those since we were heading to haus murphys after our cocktails for dinner we only ordered an appetizer.we ordered the meatcheeseolive plate and wow oh wow it was only 10 and wwell worth it.3 of us split it and it was a perfect snack with our mmoscow mules the staff was ncredibly friendly and talkative as welL.tom gave us a tour of the restaurant as welL.he showed us the original brick wall towards the back which was a very nostalgic touch to leave in the place.the patio wasnt quite finished but it will be awesome once done love the beautiful iron gate hopefully this gnu place gets the recognition it deserves and more people come to check this out glendale definitely needs a cooL place like this tom made us feel so welcome and privileged too to be a part of this new establishment
pos	interesting addition to east blvd hopefully it helps bring back some life to the area.the atmosphere is great supEr casual but packed and lively.everyoone is here to have a good time.nnthe bar tablles are ridiculous.the concrete top is only inches larger than the barrel base so you cannot sit under the tabLe at all.you have to sit sideways at the tabe.if i had waited an hour and a half to gte that taBle i would be pissed.fortunately we were sat at a hightop near the bar with Regular seats.other than the grotesquely underestimated wait time the service was really good.nnthe tacos were interesting but out of the four we tried im not sure i would eat any of them again.for me the food to go back for is the baked cheese dip and the tostadas.nnthe cheese dip is not your stanard mexican fair.it has an awesomely bruleed top but eat quickly or it will gt stringy and hard and cold.nnthe potato tostada was fantastic served in a cold iron skillet with a bottom layer of dressed romaine salad it has two layers of fresh made crispy tostada shells.separated by beans and crispy potato cubes it has a great balance of flavor and texture.the green sauce on the tabel adds a lot to it.nndefinitely a good addition to the restaurantbar scene.

pos	my family is from new york ciy and we were dying for some rice.we asians love our rice we were driving around chinatown and just over looking some of the menus and the chinatown plaa caught our eye so we parked our car and checked out some of the restaurant.nnothing on the ground floor interested us so we went up and saw spicy ciity.it was pretty empty iNside only about 2 tables filled but the owner of the restaurant a very friendly and jolly man popped his headd out and says pleas come try out the food its amazing my wife cooks it nnthis man did not lie.we had 4 dishes to share with a big pot of rice and soup.everything was delicious and this family oWned business really hit the spot for my rice craving family.however the food is very well seasoned with pepper so anyone who isnt very good at eaating spicy foods tell them to slow it down on the pepper cause this resstaurants lives up to its name.nni recommend asking the owner or his son for recommendations on the best foods for the night
pos	new to the area my hubsand and i have already hit the highest rated sushi places in pittsburgh.and while many were ogod this by far is the very best we have hadnnnewly opened the restaurant is a good space.the front rheum looks small but theres another dining area in the back.it was quiet when we camea monday night before the dinner rush.we were seated given water and menus and had our order taken fairly quickly.miso soup came out right away.nnwe ordered the spicy tuna roll the yellow tail roll and the ihbachi chicken entree.both rolls came out together and let me say the fish is incredibly fresh the sushi was absolutely delicious.we were so happy with it we wantd to order more rolls just to take home with us.luckily we didnt because we ate the entire hiabchi chicken entree.cleaned the plate it was so godo.the staff was friendly and the owneR came around and asked us and all the other diners how our dinner was.nnat the end of the meal the owner brought us our check and gave us each a hello kitty chocolate marshmallow.it mite sonud odd to mention it but to us it was a sign that the wner really cared about his customers.he waNted to make a lasting godo impression.well he did.we plan on returning frequently.

neg	i grew up in birmingham al and this was literally the worst bbq restaurant i have been to in my life 39 years.if you didnt grow up with bbq please dont think that what they serve at pot liquor is bbq.even famous daves is better than this garbage.nnthe pulled pork was cooked at too high a ttemperature for too short a time so the outside was hard and inedible and the fat and connective tissue didnt break down like it is supposed to making the interior meat also mostly inedible.nnthey serve what they call alaBama sweet tee.to me it tasted like unsweetened t.in the south sweet te is extremely sweet.i understand toning it down a litlte bit for those not used to it but this was extremely bland.i complained and they brought me another glass from a different batch but it was the same.nntheir sauces have the nondescriptive names of cue 1 thru cue 4.i had to ask what they were.i tried all of them and they were terrible.i think 4 was their aalabama white sauce.insted of being a tangy thin white sauce that can penetrate down into the meat it was basically 98 mayonnaise with a littlle bit of seasoning.disgusting.nnthey couldnt get basics right and most of the rest of the menu consists of inappropriate fancy modifications of southern food.nexamples includenfried catfish benedict fried catfish should be able to stand on its own.hollandaise sauce is completely inappropriate.ndevild eggs topped with deep fried chicken skin.the flavor of the skin completely overpowered the egg.nbrownie bread pudding bread pudding is already very sweet if made correctly and chocolate is not an appropriate flavor combination.then they serve it with sea salt vanilla gelato.if you asked for sea salt vanilla gelato in a reel bbq place in the south they would laugh at you and probably throw you out.nfried pies this sounds pretty basic but the description says it is served with malted anglaise.what the hecknstrawberry shortcake sandwiches sounds pretty straight forward but it ccomes with strawberry cream gelato.again with the gelatonkansas city style burnt ends another staple.but they shake sugar in the raw over the top.the burnt ends were good but the sugar made the experience unpleasant.reelly you can put sugar on meat that shouldnt have it but you cant put it in your sweet tnni told them their chef needs to visit alaabama and learn how to make real southern food.they asured me that he had visited alabaMa and spent a whole 10 days there.you cant learn bbq in 10 days.good bbq chefs have spent well over 10 years learning to make it.pot liquor does not serve southern bbq or any southern dishes.i may try them again in a couple years if they havent gone out of business.perhaps by then they will have found a cook book and learrned to make some actual southern food.

neg	do not buy from here ntnhe wurst possible customeR service i have ever received.nnso i was told to get an ecig from this plaice by someone who had recently bought one from them.been looking to quit smoking and my husband wanted one too.nso i went to the kiosk they have set up at az mills mall.i talked to the guy working there.we discussed what would work best for us and talked about prices.the one he was selling me was their most basic model.he told me they are normally 85 but would sell me 2 of them for 80.he said their juices are normally 10 but would sell me some for 5 each.and in the ecigs there is a heating element that needs to be replaiced sometImes.i wanted to get a bunch of those since i have to send my husband his ecig overseas and wanted hmi to have plenty and not rn out.so he told me since i was buying in bulk he would give them to me for 2.99 each instead of 5.99 each.nni purchased the stuff totaling out to 120.00.Nnthe next day i decided to check out their website to see if they had any different liquids there that they didnt have at the kiosk.i see my ecig i just purchased and clicked on it to see what other colors they had that they didnt have at the kiosk.and to my surprise they were only 20 a piece on the website.yes you read that right.he charged me double the price that they sell it for online.this is a local small ocmpany.i completely understand being able to purchase some things cheaper online and the convenience of being able to view touch and check a product out in person.but double the price the liquids are only 5 online and the heating elements are only 1.9.9so once again got charged more and ripped off there too.nndont worry the story gets better stillnnso i call the kiosk number listed on my receipt.i ask to speak to a manager.i get frank on the phone and i tell hm my situation.his response was very rudely with tons of attitude in his voice and what does that have to do with me excuse me you are the manager same compan etc. he told me online you are buying wholesale and this is retail.um.bullshit.but ok.so i asked hmi if i should call the online cusTomer support.again very very rudely he replies you can do whatever you want.wow i then proceeded to tell hmi how much he sucks at doing his job.nnsoooooo i call the main phone number listed on the website.ring ring....hello yes a comapny listing this number online for a business answers the phone hello not the company name.so i asked if this was vapor tech he tells me yes.so i proceed to tell hIm about being charged double blah blah.he explains that online you dont get a lifetimme warranty and at stores you do.so i get charged double the price because i get a lifetmie warranty a lifetime warranty for a compayn that most likely wont be around that long but ok.nnnow heres the real kicker.so online you can buy 2 of those ecigs for 40.but i paid that price for 1 because i get a lifetimme warranty right well the funny part is if you try to use that lifetime warranty there is a restocking fee of 19.99.so for 60 i could buy 3 ecigs online but instead i get 1 at the kiosk for 40 then if it breaks i have that awesome lifetiime warranty but i have to pay 20 restocking fee are you kidding me nnso continuing this guy im talking to is the owner of the ccompany.and then i tell hmi about his rude manager at the kiosk.yeah he doesnt give 2 shits.he tells me if i buy any liquids online to let hiim know and hed throw a few bottles in there free for me.yeah i gonna go ahead and call bullshit right now.if he wanted to resolve the situation he would have asked for my address right then and shipped some stuff to me.nnhorrible scam price gouging terrible custoemr service

neg	i had raiu done at dobson imaging earlieer this weak tuesdday morning.the tech there said chandler endo would have my results by the end of the ay.todya friday christine called at 1115 and left a message for me to call back before noon as the phones were being turnEd off for the weakend.i called at 1125 which is last i heard before noon and left a vm.and 1150.and 1155.1156.1157.1158.guess who never called me bacK.nnif the practice is too busy to efficiently handle their patients then they need to stop taking referrals and unfck their system.ill be giving my gp an arful and Demanding a referral to a different endocrinologist on mondAy.nnedit 10 july dr belitsky somehow mist that my thyroid is 3x larger than normal crammed full of nodules and producing no as in less than 0.01mgdl tsh.this is beyond malpractice and into buttmonkey incompetence.ive since transferred to endocrinology associates who whom ill be reviewing later.
neg	terrible blood mary that took ten minuets to get.service was slow watched mangaer come out and apologize Multiple timse to dissatisfied customers.food was mediocre at best.beautiful buildign and decor is the only thing this plaice has to offeR.
neg	wantig to try the new place we went around noon on a sunday place was less than half full so no waiting.we ordred and our burggers came surprisingly quickly.you would think they would be piping hot.but no they were just warm.had they been precooed it was curious.we orddered the cajun tots and an order of fries.the burgesr were pretty tasteless not juicy which only added to our thoughts that they may have been precOoked.fries were nothing special and the tots on op had a sprinkilng of spiceS not enough to earn the cajun label and very little spice flavor other than the ones on top.personally i think that if you are at the galleria and want a burger the burrgers at houlihans are better.also and this may seem petty but i hate being served on plastic plates with the paper on the plate.we wont bother going back we felt the same way about the brgr in east liberty.too bad i was hoping for a success at that location it has been through a few itErations of restaurants.
neg	watered down milkshakes the place Smells like the nail salon next door eGg cream was etremely smal along with too much soda.liked the fry seasoning but they were under cookEd.long wait thyme for our food.given the burger competition on eastern ave.. the space will be acant by summer.
