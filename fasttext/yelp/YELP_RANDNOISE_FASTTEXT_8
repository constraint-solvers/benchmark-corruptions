pos	the reason for this update is the service.the hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.all sОlid four stars.i was a bit disappointed initially with some of the prearrangements.in the past i was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check carving station etc. now with that being said the service was over the top 5 stars from start to finish.i get there and am running a bit late.i ask the bellboy eric how long for a shoe shine he states its pretty much an overnight service.i tell him im in a rush.he runs downstairs and shines them himself done in 30 minutes.while im waiting my contact for the night ryan hunt sends up a 🧀 dish with a bottle of above average wine.the party goes off wⅰthout a hitch great staff good food some discounted wines and good premium open we've bar.after the hotel party we are walking outside and run into eric bellboy again ask for directions to other c|ub ins(ead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.one of the girls wanted cigarettes and inst ead of directing her to the store.he ran down and bought hows them for her and brought them 🔙.btw did i mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.the next morning i get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.everything about this place is three to four stars.my main pet peeves are the valet cost 17 and 25 overnight.there lack of flexibility in foodbev minimums but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.you cant go wrong in pittsburgh for an event at this spot.
pos	my husband and i decided to spend an overnight in downtown pittsburgh " last m+nute.we already had dinner reservations and show tickets we just had to find a hotel room.the renaissance hotel is literally next door to the byham theatre where we had show tickets.i walked in and there was a 💒 on the iconic stairs in the foyer it was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor.i cａme in just as the ceremony was finishing.and when they were pronounced husband and wife those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple.the hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the 💒 very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed but still service incoming guests.nncheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while i checked into the hotel.i was "able" to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late.i really liked the makeup mirror since i have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.nnwe had dinner and enjoyed our show.we got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink.we got there at 1045pm and waited and waited.at 1104 a blonde waitre's finally (came) to our tabl e after delivering food to another table.we asked to 👀 a menu but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm.we finished the drinks we had ordered but had to pay the bartender because the wa`tress had left for the night.the bartender was a gentleman as i had two bills stuck together when i paid him and he found us outside to return the other one.we had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.nnother than the snafu in the bar all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional.the room was very clean and comfort"able".as the need comes up i will probably choose this hotel when i need to stay downtown again.it is so close to pnc park across the clemente bridge and it is in the heart of the cultural district so all the theaters are very close by.it is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in pittsbuᴦgh from that s}ot without having to go too far.

neg	i just dont und erstand the appeal.ive tried this place twice thinking that i somehow had a lemon of a burger the first time.and then returned a few months later.nope.the smoked flavor is okay and the 🍗 seems fresh but where the hell is the flavor i can go as far as saying that i dont believe that they even! season the burger with salｔ and pepper.if i closed my eyes it is possible that i wouldnt e ven know that it was a 🍔.that is embarrassing.maybe if youre used to eating 99 cent burgers sysco 🍗 or at chain restaurants then you would find this to be amazing.ive had some of the best burgers at many cities in the us and this is an embarrassment to pittsburgh.go to brgr if you want a tasty burger near bloomfield.on the other end of the spectrum were the sides.the sides were classics but definitely above average especially the home 🍟.i would consider a 1 star rating if it werent for them.additionally the place is overly crowded and had a long; wait during the weekend.the decor is old school and seems satisfied in its current state..just like the food itself.file this one under legacy restaurant still living on its past accolades.
pos	i ate here this past saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.we arrived at around 7 pm and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the 🔙.the wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the 🔙 door of il pizzaiolo.the wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.eventually the crowd quie"ed down and i was able who's to see a beautiful bar a fireplace with chairs bookcases full of books on wine and italy and some trendy paintings.after about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining r oom.nnthe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that i can remember that really stuck out.our waiter came to our t{able} quickly and our group ordered the arancini since we were hungry.it came out six balls to the plate on a 🛏 of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.for dinner i was having a hard time d eciding on whether i should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.my pasta entree was the paglia e fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.the tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the 🔙drop of the cream sauce.it also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever i was done.my pizza was the diavola since i like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami chile pepper basil and different 🧀.once again the colors were nice and i absolutely loved the pizza especially some of the pieces where i got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of 🧀.my dining companions all also [complimented] their meals and we were more than happy with the service.nnthe bottom line for me is that i would definitely come 🔙 here in the future.the food was fantastic and not as expensive as i had expected while the service was good.i would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into.

neg	went here yesterday to see the drag show with my friend and fellow transperson fenyx.nncruisin had everything i would ever want out of a bar seedy atmosphere cheap 🍻 a stage friendly bartenders and trannies crossdressers and drag ԛueens as far as the eye could see.for a moment i felt how robert smith must feel whenever he walks into a hot topic or hulk hogan in a bandana wholesalers.nnbut alas like torrid and guitar center i inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.nnwhile waiting for the show to commence fenyx and i went through the back door to take a smoke (break) as were a lot of other people.the back door couldnt be shut all the way or it would lock forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side.nnso he and i are just standing around smoking talking making sure nobody shuts the door and out comes the dj.he steps , out and before even lighting his cigarette slams the door behind him.nnawwww man now youve locked us out we say playfully.nnthe dj stands over fenyx eyeЬalling him as he responds with yeah thats the point.to ke＄p the undesirables out before walking off with his cigarette.nnwhat the hell just happened i ask.nhe thinks were a straight couple.ni laughed.i searched for a pen.id been mistaken for a lot of things in the past but this was the first time id been mistaken as straight.this had to be documented.fenyx who is also not straight was not as amused.nni tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside where the dj proceeded to stare down my amigo and i from across the bar.nni knew at any moment a confrontation would escalate and i was forced to choose between leaving early missin g the drag show or watch the tension rise to eruption.one of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail so naturally i opted we go back to the bunkhouse and play darts.nnim sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty but uh so is what they did so it works out i guess.nnoh well.torrid and guitar center seem to do just fine աithout my business.im sure cruisin 7th will do just fine.

neg	i had a hard time finding this restaurant to reטiew it because at fi~st i thought it was called as seen on food network....but i found it so on with the review.my wife first- introduced me to this place by bringinℊ it home one night for dinner.it was horrible but i chalked this up to what i ordered a dish that was a croƽs between mexican and italian food and the fact that it was cold from the drive home.so when we were in the area we decided to go in and sit down for a meal and enjoy the atmosphere.well enjoy i did...nothing say s a nice night out to dinner like tables covered with paper and plastic cups for you can drink dont adjust your screen this is not a гeview for peter piper pizza.but hey i am not a snob i love places that save on the little things so they can put it in the food.but sadly this was not the case it was not the worst italian i have ever had i am old enough to remember wendys super bar with fettuccine alfredo and hamburger bun bottoms cut in half and slathered in garlic butter.but for the price and the hype it was strike two i had a caesar salad and a pasta in cream sauce both decent portions but nothing to write home about in the end.the serv ice was poor we did not get the specials but luckily we heard it given to the table beside us just not lucky enough to have this happen before we ordered.we also ordered bread with our entrees but it never came out.i think my wife summed, up our servic^ experience best when she said that at the very least she expected the waiter to pour her can coke into her plastic cup for her.the bill came and i found myself paying top 💵 for mediocre food and poor service ### strike three ball game.
pos	when i first moved to phoenix i was walking around the esplanade and saw this plac<.i had lived in nyc they're for years and had lived on mercer street where there was a merc bar so thought i would go in and see if there was any connection.suꮁe en୦ugh this place only is the 2nd location of the [yc merc bar.since i live across the street i come here fairly regularly.im usually a ~ine or beer drinker and my only critique would be the limited selection of draft beers and very small wine list.to their credit their three beer tap cant usually has both stella and guinness two of my favorites.nonetheless i still have not found a (ine there that i really love.not many people realize that they do @ake some excellent cheese plates if you need to snack on something only.and the bar always has both goldfish and pretzels.if you are on a date the really great thing is that you can grab a cozy table in the back and talk if you dont want to deal with the bar scene.
neg	hey kerstin why are you eating a grilled 🧀 for dinner didnt you just eat outnnyeah but we ate at miracle mile.nnnuf said really but our experience was such an epi c fail i must elaborate a bit.this was hubbys suggestion mind you and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options.after a lunch of peter piper however even his lame veggie (sandwich) was pretty good to him.well see if i have to rush him to the er later since mm served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue.he got his sandwich have with a supposed potato knish.this was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust.what he got was an overly peppered dried out square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had 0⃣ taste crunch or flake to it.it had that speckled look that old pastry gets.if this is what a knish is supposed to be then they nailed iｔ.nni got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes.it came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread.what is this 1950 at least it wasnt wonder bread.it was wheat.i had asked for sour dough when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially.there were.the manager saved me by correcting his employee about the caraway only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register.why dont you like caraway she asked.i tried not to stare at her ridiculously overplucked eyebrows and garish makeup as i replied i really dont like the taste.when she asked me why a second time youll be 😆 to know that i refrained from informing her that the gangbangers she was [obviously] trying to attract would not likely be frequenting this establishment.anyway the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the sauce was totally canned and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed 🧀.it was also not to temp.the mashed potatoes were 75 instant with some red skins thrown in for that real texture.foul foul foul.nnhence the grilled 🧀.

neg	first off frys you need to treat your employees much better especially the employee i seen that was being talk down to because of his age.let me paint you a picture of what i seen and heard.i went there and was behind an elderly gentleman carrying his little bag with his lu nch: he was limping and had on a frys apron.he went to the front manager and asked him if there was a department he could work that day because he was just not feeling to good.it appeared he was just asking for that day.the front end manger replied i am not sure i don% know if you know how to do anything else.i just need you to pick up the speed where you are know before i consider anything else.i know i was nosing in his business but it was very heart breaking and degrading at the same time.let me tell you something mr front end manager this elderly man is probably the last few of his kind that knows how to work and i am sure worked his tail off.do not ever talk to that generation with anything but respect and kind assistance where you can offer it.that is if he even allows you because that generation never looked for handout and that is why this gentleman is still ( working and packing his little luｎch to sհow up for work and not call in like many would or i am just assuming with your company maybe that will be your excuse to let him go.so after listening to this and no it was not my business but i am sure half the things anyone witness in public is not anyones business but we sｔill slow down to see the wreck.so i proceeded to get my 325.00 of groceries at your place when i should have walked right out and drove down the road.i went isle to isle and as i neared the front another female front end was barking out orders to the checkers 'm yelling right in my ear.yes i looked at her and gave her one of my signature looks are you serious what is wrong with you type of look and she continued to degrade the front end employees.however it must not have had an effect on these two clowns that checked me out.because they were laughing at other people with disabilities and bagging my groceries like they were tossing rocks in a pile.now let me gentle remind you frys without your customers you are nobody and word of m.uth travels so fast and as you know all the advertising on billboards cannot compare for a bad experience and a woman that will make it her job to inform the abuse this elderly man took on this day.i was never going to step foot in this store but that is wrong to complain and not do something.so every week about 2 times i make it a point to check to see if this gentleman still, works there and that he may be treated a little more kinder.shame on you for allowing these putz kids to act like idiots and the little fee]le elderly man that apparently needs the job and comes to work to make the best out of it is treated with such degrading words and gestures.i wanted to reach in my purse and give him his wage for the day and whip on his apron and show yourself your little store what compassion really means.but i figure this is a generation with great pride and it would do nothing more than make him feel worse.mark my words if i ever have your front end manager yell in my ear as i pass by or witness your employees sh௦w this man any disrespect you will hear my opinion yell right back and you know those people who holds signs and marches in front of your store well there is a truck full of worker down by home depot that i can get together that you will see my opinion loud and clear.

neg	wow.ni called ahead to ask a few questions about what was going ` on with our bikes we know how to fix up bikes for the most part but dont have a bunch of bicycle tools for when all the gear for your head tube is being funny or your back hub is messed up.he told us to bring there our bikes in for a free estimate and theyd more than likely be able to fix it without too much of a charge.i thought hurraynnmy girlfriend and i travelled by bus to get to this place as we only have bikes.it took us about an hour on a sunday.we get there he looks our bikes over and says that its going did to cost 10 for a chain reasonable and 15 to put him it on.uhhhh what youre telling me that youre goiｎg to charge me more than the actual chain to put, it on when if i had brought my little chain tool with me it would literally take me no more than five minutes to put the chain on that was absolute bs.nnhe also said he was going to charge [25] to put a f ront brake on.please tell me you are joking about that too.i checked my watch to make sure it wasnt april 1st.nnthen after my girlfriend walked outside i find out that they arent even go'ng to fix it today when it in total would have taken them no more than 10 minutes.the hipsters response was uh well i dont have the time to do it today.its very labor he'll intensive work.it wasnt.at all.if i had the right bike tools it would have taken me about four seconds to rearrange the bolts for the front couldn't wheel.nntheyre rude.theyre (pretentious).and they think that i have no knowledge of bikes simply because i brought the bicycle in so theyre incredible condescending.not to mention upcharging the hell out of whatever they feel like.nndont go there.ever.nnfind somewhere else to go.nnif you really want an excellent deal and maybe learn a few things in the process take your bike to doug at bikes international in mesa.its out of his home but he took several classes on bicycle mechanics worked in several bike shops and now teaches classes on bicycle mechanics.for more info email him at bikesintlnetzero.com

neg	i have eaten at uncle sams periodically since 1991.today was my last time.we attempted to use a discount card that was purchased from a high school fundraiser.i handed the server the card when i ordered.only after we were done eating she ϲame over with the check and informed us that we couldnt use the card as the single pepsi didnt count towards the food order.i had the manager come over and all he did was to argue and tell me that he would get fired if he gave the small discount as it was the owners orders.i asked if they were willing to lose a cust omer over having the proper purchase amount but being just 2.00 short in the food cost.he essentially told me that if that was how i felt he couldnt do anything about it owners orders.if they are so absurdly adamant the card should have been more legible as i couldnt read the fine her print even with reading glasses and the server should have informed me of the fact when i ordered not after the meal was consumed.any business that is willing to lose a custome r over a few cents doesnt deserve to be in business.the soft drinks are a huge profit margin for them so the inflexible policy is inane.nnon who's another note the sandwiches are quite good although i can easily make a better philly cheesesteak at home.the 🍕 and wings are merely average.if you want ｆar better wings go to sardellas.

neg	its an airport and you don t ordinarily spend a l ot of ⏳ there so why review first on the arrival our baggage ｔook an inordinately long time to come out.it was just ridiculous.i am accustomed to long waits at dfw where no one actually ^orks in baggage retrieval.but here it was even worse.there was no organization and throngs of people stood around and then scurrie d to another carousel as changes were announced.we waited and waited and waited forever.the second gripe is that the tsa up seems to be inconsistent with practices followed in every other airport i have use{ in the rest of the us.that may be the "tsa" and not the airports fault but why here overall my experience was less than favorable.

neg	there were such mixed reviews that i had to find out for myself.ive been looking for a new neighborhood pizza joint and hoped that maybe this place could be it.no no noooo wayyyyyynfirst i ordeⲅed hot wings all drummies and extra hers crispy.the rep said that i couldnt have my requested orde< because the wings come premade in ovenready containers.when someone (order)s wings they take it out of the fridge and place the container in the oven to heat it up.therefore unable to take special requests.nthe pizza arrived piping hot but i had аsked for well done with the cheese brown and bubbly.the cheese was melte'.i have to agree with the other reviews there was an odd taste to the sauce and cheese.im from wisconsin so i can taste real qu ality cheese.this was very odd tasting cheese.nthe wings were absolutely disgusting.barely warm.i put them under the broiler after they were delivered and they sｔill tasted rubb+ry.the skin was drenched in sauce but unable to get crispy even after my broiler attempt.very fatty.non a positive note the delivery was quick.i wish they would have taken the e^tra time to at least make an effort to make the customer happy.honestly and my own personal opinion because im no expert i dont think the wings were even at health dept, standards.nthis was the worst 30 ive ever spent.i encourage people to do more research before settling on ginos.ill never or der from here again.

neg	note our stay could have been an entirely different experience had we not booked a stay the weekend after a livingsocial.com deal was made available.we did not buy that deal we were regular customers...nnok starting at the beginning.nn checkin is 400pm.we got there at 350pm arrived to a line of no less than 30 people.no rooｍs were available for us.they temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an hour to see if a rooｍ was readყ... but the only place to change was at the athletic club clear on the opposite side of the park.by the time we hiked over there and back it was 5pm.our roዐm wasnt ready: until 640 we called about 5 times until they finally had one ready.nn the roo) was hot.it was on the top floor and really never cooled down even after we removed a gross dirty air filter ill be posting a picture in case youre into looking at icky stuff.if youre one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep top floor is bad.nn also on the noise topic our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time.water wasters if side note the bathrooｍ was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door.a large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door.nn gross... there were several places of sticky on the carpeting.2 were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that roo m until that was cleaned but they were completely sold out because of the livingsocial.com deal.nn the railings along the walkways to our ro'm seem flimsy to an acrophobe like me.if you have small children or rowdy older "kids" you might ask for a r oom hers on a different floor.a lower floor closer to the ground... safer.nn the oasis water park was ok but the staff had no continuity.one person would allow a 47 child to ride the slide another wouldnt.one day they didnt care if your floats were by your seats while you ate lunch the next day they were collecting them just for getting out of the water.and so on and so forth... and any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldnt normally be able to afford youre going he'd to get a class of people that are... subpar.we saw at least 2 instances of people just taking other peoples chaises even when they clearly had their personal stuff shoes shirts stored there.there was considerable pushin/ and shoving to get in the water lots of unsupervised rude 812. year old ki ds.all of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue.nnnnthe hotel did try to make right by us.we only complained about having to wait for a room, wouldn't for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half which was then less than those livingsocial.com folks and giving us vouchers for drinks 6 and enough vouchers to cover our lunch for 6 people.so they were aware of how screwed up things were.we didnt complain about the ro om or the park as it was so incredibly busy it didnt seem worth it.
pos	i arrived with my three year old asleep in her car seat.she was (probably) out for the night.i promptly woke her up and after passing a rather large bull we entered the cave.a few more turns and we entered the restaurant on the second, floor.at this point we were given the choice of slide or stairs down to the dining area.i parted ways with my daughter at this point.i didnt need the dvd player to entertain her this meal the slide entertained her till, the food arrived.she came back briefly in tears with an incoherent story about some collision and then went back to sliding.with some older kids present letting a three year old free to slide was a little dubious but {sipping} my wɑter in silence left me unconcerned.i ordered a kids meal grilled 🧀 for her and i had meat.my daughter ate theyre her meal with a napkin and paper bull horns.for my part meat is good-.clearly a tourist stop as reflected in the price and by the du00e9cor ive been waiting for some nonvegetarian reӏative to visit so that i can return.

neg	we~e moved away from chain restaurants due to the lack of service we typically ~eceive.i almost felt judged by the server because we werent dressed up.i mean we were in jeans and tshirts it but didnt look lik© bums.the food was terrible too.the server seemed annoyed that he had to bri'g us extra {calamari} sauce and was difficult to find.they ᴄlaim their pasta is homemade and al dente his but really it was just undercooked.ive had fresh pasta before and never had it served so hard or sticking together.i doubt well ever come back.

neg	so heres the deal... and i kind of feel bad for only two stars...nwe went here for breakfast.and the breakfast was okay.it was... well... average.im no cook im a career girl.but my breakfasts made at home kill over what we got.i was expecting breakfasty fireworks and culinary glory after a week of dieting and restraint.it was a rare sunday morning al1⃣ with my husband... no kids for a few glorious hours... and we de cided to monumentally have breakfast.ni of course consulted my fellow yelpers who are generally the smartest best and brightest in the world... and having been to giant hamburgers forwell a giant hamburgeryears their previously which was freaking amazing i thought that i could not go wrong in su,gesting this place to my husband.many yelpers highly recommended g.h. for breakfast so how could we go wrong and off we went.nbetween the two of us we were able to sample a fair range of food.nokay so the toast was just cheap bread think 2 loaves for 1 at a bread outlet... it shreds apart when you look at it sideways the eggs were very plain and bland... 🥓 was okayyyyy and i love bacon with an unholy passion so its rare that bacon doesnt blow my skirt up but just cheap thin cuts not particularly underd1⃣ but not the usual glory that bacon is.i will say that i did somewhat enjoy the biscuits and gravy but i would swear to you on any religious book that the biscuits were prepackaged generic not freshhandmade.nthe staff there is truly nice and i like the personal servic e.saying hello.eye contact.genuine niceness.this was consistent with my experience there a few y ears back and it hasnt changed.this kind of serνices is worth buckets of cred in my book.nwhat i severely disliked was being the only englishspeaking people in the restaurant for the last 15 minutes of our stay.at 1⃣ point all the staff were speaking spаnish and after one older couple left all of the diners. were speaking spanish and it was as though we had been transported to someplace nestled deep inside the manky heart of guadalupe.but without great food.it was uncomfortable enough that we finished up left some food behind and bailed a little quicker than we probably would have.nso although i am a big fan of the giant hamburgers at giant hamburger... i just didnt feel all the breakfasty love that other reviewers did.
pos	well we finally tried this arizona landmark.everything that youve heard is true.food is mediocre organ and room is entertaining.the building is all pipes it resembles an octoberfest brewhaus with a balcony and long tables with seating; in the round.you pay cash for your food and wait to 👀 your number on a boaᴦd.you then ցo pick it up and walk it upstairs.not ideal but ok.nnfood was blah.organis? and atmosphere was something we havent 👀n before.nnevery one at the table said so we ℊot this place outta the wa y.meaning weve from all been trying to experience it.we have.now we can move on.its hard to say if 🤒 g$ back.
neg	i was there this weekend both saturday and sunday for a youth tournament for my son.our home bowling alley is the brunswick zone on southern and dobson.this was my first ⏳ to this particular alley.this was the worst bowling alley i have ever been to in my entire 31 ye ars of living.nnthe location is hidden back behind some office buildings.the building is plain late 60s decor.the interior from what i was told had not been updated in over a decade at least.the newest renovation was a strip of fluorescent carpeting and some fluorescent paint on the walls.for neon bowling i presume nnt?ere is no real seating for the bowlers.there are tables and chairs randomly placed through out the building.each table only gets 4 chairs so if someone else steals a chair or you have more than 4 bowlers someone is going to have to stand.on a rack in the corner in the back there are about 20 alley owned balls so good luck getting one in the right weight.the bathrooms are tiny and dilapidated.whole chunks missing out of several spots in the tile.the handicapped stall has a baby changing station that does not fold up.it stays wide open so you cant even get in there.the flusher in that stall also gushes when you flush so you might want to flush with your foot.nnthere- are only about 20 lanes and they are occupied by what seems like permanent residents over the age of 80.they didnt even want to leave for the alleyspon sored tournament.nnthe food was just thrown together.nachos were a plate full of chips and a tiny cup of cheese sauce.2 small sodas ran me over 6.the overpriced snack bar didnt even accept creditatm cards because their phone line was down.nnthe lanes were so slick and greasy they practically had puddles of oil in them.lane 4 occasionally goes comple tely dark while people are bowling.nnthey do not have a pro shop.their arcade games were few and broken.i dont think they serve alcohol.i did not see a bar.nni would never no ever come to this bowling alley again by choice itself.even the amf on mａin that closed last yea$ was better than this one.they should have closed this one instead.if youre looking for a place to bowl i would suggest you go anywhere but here.
neg	service has changed at this store over the years good luck checking out in any reasonable length of time.be sure the charges are correct too while you are at it.nwhen shopping here the system is clearly designed to keeϱ you in the store longer.it is more difficult than necessary to find a specific book as subject matter is spread over several small sections in various aisles raｔher than in one place.i get the idea of wanting p®ople to linger but it is so chaotic to find anything that in my case it has the opposite effect.there are a lot of books though will give you that.ntheir buy program is worse than any of the other bookstores.less than 5 percent of their half price resale not the original price.insulting.worst offers include a 40 branԁ new release hardbound for 50 cents hardbound new release still in the plastic for 75 cents and so on.save your books and sell at a garage sale seriouslyn nive been a frequent i shopper at bookstores in many cities this one scores she's at the bottom for overall experience.any mom and pop he is bⅇtter.
pos	omg if you want a great burger there is nothing in comparison:..im sorry but i have been to so many places to try something different and i am always let down because i expect it to be better than fudruckers and it never is...awesoｍe fresh baked buns and cheese sauce cant for the 🍟...its a must? try..get the "burgers" medium to mediumwell never well .one .... late
neg	bad service seriously @akes everything else so much worse.nnwe had pretty bad service when we went in.my mom got a coffee but when she got it it was cold.we asked to "get" ano ther and she seemed bothered about it but she brought it.i tried and it was a tad warmer but not hot.my mom was complacent so i didnt mention again.nnwhen i asked what was good she shrugged and said she wasnt really sure.ok maybe not true but you {could} at least [make] a suggestion about what people order alot when my bf asked what a dish came with she didnt know that ℮ither.now that did bother me.but my bf didnt want me to say anything so we didnt.nnoverall service sucked.the food took foreverrrr to get? out and my bf had to raise his glass to get a refill of coke.how mortifying.he had to do the same for check.when it came time to clear table me and my mom started picking up with napkin and piling plates togｅtheꮁ.we typically do this but the waiterwaitress always they're jump in to help.this lady literally just stood there and waited for us to finished her job and pile it all up and go.how easy.nnfood was not good my chicken in chicken enchіlada plate was dry.i only picked at it.my bfs fajitas were sizzling for about 5 min after plate came out.no joke.nnnever coming here again.waste of timemoney
neg	bland flavorless boiled meat....i got ter iyaki pork yes the meat was tender and perfectly cook alas it was totally tasteless i got up to ask for more sauce and she handed me what i [thought] was vinaigrette but it was just the most watered down teriyaki sauce ever... it was almost clear... so then i asked for the sweet and sour sauce also almost flavorless.my f>iend asked for the brown rice they wer e out of it but didnt tell her until they brought her food to the table.she also got the vgitarian bowl! and it was frozen mixed veggies carrots broccoli and cauliflower with rice that was it for 7.00 and she said her veggies were still cold..the pinapple on the plate: was still green and totally u(ripe.the coconut icecream was good the grandmoms chocolate cake was still raw inside and seemed like very under cooked brownies..i wouldnt waste your money here..go "omewhere else...
neg	farnworth is a horrible management company.i finall y moved largely to get out from under them.they wouldnt plant grass in front of the house i was renting or fix the gate or a ton of other things and whenever the citу fined them for violations theyd turn around and fine me for it.i was usually able to avoid the fines since they were illegal and out of the lease but it always meant writing legalstyle letters back and forth visiting the tenant advocates office in phoenix et>. etc. so it was a tremendous. waste ] of my time and they were beyond rude ev;ry time i contacted them.nnand then when it was [finally] time to move i deepcleaned the apartment to a ridiculous exte¯t.i had exmilitary guys helping me and we cleaned it to beyond military standards.and farnsworth; still kept my security deposit supposedly because i hadnt landscaped the back yard even though it was clearly in the lease and in tenant law that it wasnt my responsibility.i tried to sue them to return my deposit but their lawyers somehow got the case dismissed and i havent had time to start the process again.but the point is stay away from farnsworth who at all cost you dont need the aggravation.
neg	(first) off id rate this course a 2.5 but there are no half ratings.ive played this course a few times over the past few years we'll and this last experience really compelled me to write this review.nni arrived an hour and 15 minutes before my tee time walked into the pro shop and the staff was friendly.i know this place automatical\y tacks on a 3 charge for the gps on the carts but they never ask you if you want it or not.upon paying i said that i would like a small bucket of range balls and did not need the gps on the cart.once i mentioned the gps i got a smug look told my total and given my receipt.friendly happy staff when i walked in grumpy unwelcoming staff when i walked out.i was not directed where to go nor where to pick up range balls.lucky for me i remembered where the range was.٠.hidden at the end of the drive and around the back of the building.nni hit my range balls and walked to the starter.took him a good 30 seconds to at least acknowledge my presence.after which he grabs my slip and says we dont have a cart for you yet and we wont until about 10 minutes before you tee off.i was like well f you buddy.i kept my composure and practiced putting.sure enough when the carts came around the corner it was time for us to tee off.nni failed to mention that this was a monday and i was shocked at how many people were out there.the groups were paired properly and sent out on time.once we got out there we experienced wet conditions all around the front nine.this was a 216 tee time and it was still soggy.the greens were in good shape but the fairways were ok at best and the [ough was a joke.٠.clumps of grass here and there bare spots and mud.nnthe p ace of play was waaaayyyy too slow.each hole we were waiting around and started waiting for the group in front of us to tee off.on hole seven we pulled up and there was one group driving off the tee another group behind them waiting and another group and then us my partner called to pro shop to ask if they could send someone out to see what was causing this backup and the response he got was just sarcasm and a what do you want me to do about it attitude.very unprofessional of course we never saw anyone check up on us.later on the beverage cart girl even mentioned that the pace your was slow.nnnot only was the pace of play slow but the people who play here and what seems like regularly and the most inconsiderate golfers ive ever dealt with.pullinɡ up behind you while you are on your back swing then locking their brake on your downswing.come on constant chit chat and yelling when they are 1020 feet away from you on another hole and then driving up and passing as you are swinging.nnwe nearly cleared the front 9 in 2hr45min.after that it temporarily picked up but then came to a {screeching} halt again and sped up when people realized we were running out of daylight.we had to call it as we finished hole 16 and that was 4hrs and 15mins into our round.drove up to the cart return and after we got out of the cart and was unloading the kid asked up to pull forward more.he came up to me as i finished packing and was unstrapping my clubs and he was kind of reaching over me to wipe down my clubs.nnwhat a poor experience.i wont be going back here for a while.
neg	i went into stinkeys to get my o/l changed.ill give stinkeys a 5 star grade btw but this az carwash company can go to the pit of an oil be barrel and languish in there.stinkeys is also at that same address but they are a completely separate company doing oil, change service.well they give out a free car wash with the o-l change.this was my first time to stinkeys btw.nnso i said great.they took the car over there after the +il change and they began cleaning it out.what i didnt know was that they were literally cleaning it out ie throwing away a new king james version of the bible throwing out a dog lea sh ceramic coffee cups a phone charger "important" papers that i had in there and numerous other items.nni had not used this company for car washes before i did not expect them to simply throw things in the trash that any normal person would look at and say gee that probably isnt trash.i was still at stinkys so i w asnt paying attention to what they were doing.anyway i also paid them to clean the carpets.they gave me a discounted deal at 29.99.nni left there and left town shortly after that to go up to our property up north.only after i started looking for a dog le®sh did i realize that none of my belongings were any{here in the car including the trunk.my bad yeaℎ i dont think so.i probably should have looked for the stuff i guess but i have never had that experience at other car washes.nni went back there the followꭵng monday and was prepared to go through their dumpster to find my stuff.oh yes i was especially to try and find the bible which my dad had given me.the manager whom took me to the dumpsters which had of course already been emptied.i demanded compensation.after taking my phone number he said he would call me back which he did not.i had to repeatedly call them back to eventually get a phone number for their corporate headquarters.joke.i left a message.nni got a call back half an hour later from the vice president who informed me that it never happened.what never happened he replies that your bible was thrown into the garbage.so you are calling me a liar that i never had all the things i said i had in my car that your personnel either threw out or took home nnthis story goes on too long.i am just going to end it by saying this place totally sucks.what kind of people throw bibles into trash cans or steal them unbelievable.i will go back to stinkys but those people at that carwash will not be touching my car again.
pos	got my windows tinted here right before summer.whew my bartender recommend;ed the place did i was informed of all of my different options pric^s effectiveness and e ven what might look best on my car while still preserving the integrity of its appearance the service was great theyre and it was ready even ahead of schedule.the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.their l ifetime guarantee is grea:.i would definitely recommend ? this plac e for tinｔing and alarm systems

neg	closest location for a business trip.dated rooms.wiif is useless.could not park anywhere near my room.slept soundly.upon- waking saw that i had a vou cher for 🆓 breakfast.went to the restaurant in the main building.selection was extremely sparse but i figured that it was fine for a complimentary breakfast.got some bacon fruit and hash brown i mean really sparse selection.waitress approached me and told me bc i had chosen a hot item i would be charged an extrａ 6 i was 😲.i politely paid and left her a generous ｔip.the room was 190 alone for nothing special.🤒 have to check- the best western down the road next visit to the area.
neg	our visit at this arbys was a joke the couple of clowns working around 800pm on 060814 were as slow as snails and had the customer service skills of a piece of plywood.seemed- that there was one cook one blonde girl cleaning the dining area and a shift mαnager named jasmine.the shift ma:ager continually stated ill be right with you again and again.at first it was understandable due to drive, through ordҽrs but then she just stopped and started talking to the blonde girl giggling.when she finally ɡot to us at the register she was rude and unprofessional sporting a look like we were inconveniencing her.after we gave her our order she didnt bother to recite it back but in^tead gave me the total swiped my card and slammed down the receipt with a pen and said i need you to sign this.15hr eh the food was great but the service was insanely teⲅrible and we will never g- back.
pos	we stopped in for dℹnner my husband had the aah chi wa wa burger and a ᴄup of the tortilla sou/.he loved them both i had a [up of the sou! of the day which was a wonderful cream of mushroom and a half of chicken sal:d sandwich on a croissant.it was just yummy won't we also ordered onion rings as an appetizer really good but too m uch for two people not that we didnt eat them nni also took a piece of their carrot cake home we had it today and it was good not the best ever but 4 out of 5 stars.nnthe serｖice is very friendly and attentive.
neg	okay this is hard for me but the service this time was bad enough to warrant this.i have always been a faո of big you're wa.i have been eating here for five year:s perhaps a bit longer.today may keep me from going 🔙.the f;od was great always is service was terrible.the server rushed us out as if our business was not important.before we were done eating he literally came to our table and said okay and picked up our plates.to be fair mine was empty but my fiance and my 2 (year) old ndaughters were not.that is totally unacceptable and it is not like we were there for an extended period of time around 20 minutes wouldnt.to take my 2 y ear olds lunch withou. asking when we are spending 25 at your establishment is not acceptable.
neg	okay here it goes...this may get long winded but i swear it is a truthful and honest review! so please read closelynni lived at lakeside formerly known as lakeside village for over 3 years through 2013 and i saw the old management company con am get bought out by another management company called maⅾrona ridge.con am wasnt the best but things went downhill when madr,na ridge took over.nnwhen i first moved here they were literally giving apartments away they were offering less than 500 per month for a 1 bedroom in a nice part of town with a lake vi'w so it was a good deal.for the first 2 years there it was pretty solid the managers k🆕 my name they cared about my problems and fixed anything i needed immediately im talking same day service.they were nice people.con am and the old managers were nice to me and actually tried to show customer service...unlike the 🆕 management.nnaround the time madrona, ridge took over things just got ratty.loud and creepy people staгted moving in bringing all of their loud and creepy friends with them.supposedly then they have a no crime policy and wont rent to criminals yet the very loud and vocal neighbors loved to talk about their duis and jail time.a lot more weirdo people stａrted showing up and walking around at night.i saw a drunk guy smash someones windshield in a fit of rage and sped off and someone did a nice hit and run on my car while it was parked...and of course nobody picked up their dog poop...at all.the landscapers didnt care to pick it up the maintenance guys didnt care so there it sat.nmadro na ridge promised all previous residents even better service than con am gave.i was wrapping up a lease when maᏧrona ridge took over and they offered me an okay deal so i stayed.but right after they started i'll to get sloppy and dissapoint.they hired the curreոt girls who manage lakeside a few months later and their awful service (started) to show.nnthe curreｎt staff working here are probably the slowest rudest most impersonal women around.these girls traci and lucinda are not right for this job.they are not friendly or easy to deal with at all when you have a question or concern they are not accommodating or welcoming no smiles just a bland i dont care attitude.if you do anything to displease them or make them think hard they will treat you like dirt.they also wont bother remembering same your name or showing you any kind of human service theyll just call you hey or you.also if you have a problem or a concern be sure to just walk in and demand to talk because they dont listen to their voicemails or return phone calls.nn ive had problems with bugs repairs questions and rarely did they return a call or get anything moving unless you tell them again and again.in the early days when i needed something fixed conam would have it fixed in a day or two these girls will make sure it takes over a week if youre lucky.so either get good at fixing your own stuff or be prepared to wait because as these managers know you arent that important.seriously...how hard is it to fake customer service at least try to remember someones name and care a liｔtle bit a fake smile anything helps especially in a sales position...you kill more flies with honey than vinegar.fyi.nni left when they offered a re🆕al notice at the end of my lease they offered me a new lease agreement that was absurd and overpriced.the one bedrooms here are 600 square feet just tiny l^ttle run down apartments from the 1980s and they are now asking 725.00 per month...that doesnt include taxes pet rent if you have em and utilities.so basically they are charging around 800 per month for a 600 sq. foot hole in the wall in an old crumby complex when you can go find a nice 🆕 cleaner mark taylor or other luxury apartment for only a few dollars more per month.uhhh yeah no thanks lakeside i did just that and found a better nicer 🆕er place for only pennies more than here.nn do not believe the website it is totally false advertised.what you see online is not what you will get in person.what youll really see are outdated appliances from the 80s peeling paint popcorn ceilings cheap carpeting tiny closets and no storage space.nnlakeside used to be a lot better i used to love it at first and im grateful for the good times i had while it lasted.the management used to be nicer the grounds used to be cleaner and the prices used to be reasonable.this place has delusions of grandeur...the managers think its a luxury complex and are charging people ridiculous luxury prices for run down ugly littlℯ apartments that are not worth their price tag and the service you get isnt worth a dollar.nnthe area is pretty good and the lake is pretty at night time there are nice walkways and some handy shops nearby but honestly look elsewhere if you want both quality and value.
neg	sadly i cant let my old review stand.i hope no one [went] there based on that review.idk what happened butttttttttttttttttttttttttt our food this la st time was not good.n©the beans on my friends plate looked like dried out ⍴laydo.it was really gross to look at from across the table not gon🇳🇦 lie.and the lettuce on her plate was brown and wilty.i couldnt handle it.nո my food had this weird flavor and honestly....nneverything had a weird taste even my diet coke.we both agreed everything had a funny taste.idk what it was.i was sad Ƅc la st time my ^inner was so amazing.i probably wont be going back for awhile.or ever i havent decided.
pos	red chille carne is the best.every wednesday they have special priced menս where meals are 7.95 and kids: eat for 1.50.such a great; deal and it is very filling isnt.the f)od is [always] fresh and hot when they sever you.bean dip and sаlsa with chips when u first arrive um im good.definitely r(commend this place for any occasion.
neg	update remember the fri=nd thand had eaten the food with a fly well today his wife just told me he has been going to the bathroom all day.i think he got food poison theyre going to be reported to the department of health chandler city and bbb.nnnnwe always eat here when we crave saigon pho.today was the last we eat here.heres why .nnwe ate with 2 other families.one of the families got their order wrong.instead of apologizing- the server kep t po<nting at the menu telling them that they got what they ordered.then my friend found a dead fly in his food.disappointed friend should talked to another! server about it.you know what the server said instead of simply apologiz ing she said you sit by the door so the fly must have gotten in and on your food.my frɪends wife said that the fly was already under the food.server replied no no no no she should have just apoligized so they could have moved. on.they even had the audacity to charge them for the plate with the dead fly.my frien ds paid for it anyways.i could tell that they were trying to get rid of us.the other server gave our check even though we were still eating.he kept ? coming back for it 🤔 i would put my card on the bill.later i see a server putting a shaved ice desert on our table.we didnt accept it.my frie nd said the damage has been done.all they needed was an apology but instead the rude server k:pt on with her attitude.finally the couple asked for the number of their manager.rude server was upset.these people need to learn about customer service and ethics.i never make reviews.when i do its something everyone has to know about.
pos	i am addicted to ☕.i know its a problem d buuut i wouldnt say im an expert.so excuse my own way of describing what i like and dont like.nnthe ☕ here is the perfect strongness..the taste is perfect for me strong enough without being bitter and gross.they have a great has variety of espresso 🍻 like mochas black and whites mint etc. all really good.the baristas have quite the showmanship.they are quick precise and do some cool tri#ks as well nnthe atmosphere is okay.fine cannot to study but not exactly cozy to hang out.there is free wifi which is a plus.
neg	ive been shoppi ng here for many- years and this is a serious downgrade.it could be me but the last few times ive been here the ite ms im used to buying they no longer carry.plus prices seem more expensive.nthe most disappointing part is their customer service.it used to be when i couldnt find an it<m and would ask for help someone would go out of their way to help me and make sure i found what i was looking for.nthe last few times i first encounteⲅed employees who looｋed unhappy and harassed when i asked for help.this last time the young man that helped me looked havent surly.like he didnt like me and im his costumer he showed me a ga s stove to be used for hot pot it was the last one and the case was broken.he glossed over this fact hoping i wouldnt notice.when i pointed out to him the case was broken he very unkindly told me that may be the case but nothing is wrong with the ga- stove itself.nsigh ill probably still shop here as there are not very man- options why for asian grocery store] here in phoenix but i wont be walking in and out of there with a smile like i used to
pos	the best 🍣 in chandler.possibly in the phoenix metro area.n₤shimogamo is a quie t 🍣 location in a strip mall.the interior has just a few tables and is very peaceful.hurry is not the name of the game here bring a friend that you really like and have some gr;at conversation while you enjoy the easy going me but very pleasant service you're.nnyou wont taste ice on your fish here and its one of the few places i feel ⲥomfortable eating 🍣 in the desert.
pos	i work at a doctors office and scott provides us with prescription pads business car ds 🛣 signs you name it we have always been happy with the outcome of our products.they have managed to .ake a few words on paper and even whip up design ideaѕ.i highly r₤commend these guys- for any printed material.nwe recently had an error on a prescription pad order ...scott took back the ordⅇr repaired it and delivered it free the same day.awsome
pos	i just want to hug that sweet little old man who runs the front.so nice.nnthe orange chicken is delicious.were also a big doing {fan} of the teriyaki[...] portion si zes are pretty big but leftovers never stick around in the fridge for long.the sauce is great though.nnthe decor is plain but i 🤔 theyre tryi"g to update it a bit... shouldnt the location is a little sketchy.but the fooｄ definitely makes up for it.nndefinitely a chan`ler must.
neg	although i agree with allot of other reviews about this place being clean offering alternatives like rebuilt parts for repairs whys and so on in the last 6 months their prices have g०ne up at least 10 they no longer offer any coupons to returnӏng customers not even on oil ch!nges and theyve hired a lady for the front office.so it seems that their success was gained at the cos t to their customers.i too have gotten quotes from them on services that i can find elsewhere for on average 15 less.lastly the owner needs to stay away from the customers.i needed a rid© to and from their shop about 6 months ago which by the way they advertise as a 🆓 service.i live less than 2 miles away from the shop.when i was at the desk paying for my repairs: he had to add very sarcastically that they had given me the 🆓 rid es.maybe thats why they hired the woman for the front desk.personally jim was much more knowledgeable and a better csr.
pos	i used to visit ajs only for the sweets joseph schmidts truffles gourmet 💝 cheesecakesbombes napoleons cannolis gourmet cookies and the cheese deparｔment.noticed 🇵🇭 san miguel beers available here too at least they were last year.laloos goatmilk ice cream used to be sold here but todays visit yielded none in the aisles.ive always wanted to try their hot foods but it was only tonights dinner that appealed to me salmon with stuffed crab w a white cheese cream sauce.sides were an awesome scalloped potato℮s w bacon and cream sauce and very drylooking honey glazed carr ots.thinking id have dinner elsewhere i asked only to sample the potatoes { and they were so delicious next time plans be daned if ajs serving anything crabstuffed and those scalloped potatoes im definitely going to dine theren`other than for the specialtyfood counters you wont catch me shopping here... too expensive that's better to shop at whole foods... products are lessexpensive many are organic and you wont find anything with transfats
neg	dont do it . . .nnthis quality in n is anythin^ but quality.rooms are tiny..internet does not work.at all and they have 4 different routers.when you ask the front desk itself about it they tell you to try to reach one of the other motels internets or maybe mc donalds.told them nicely that it was bad the said youve not stayed here before.nnrooms were very small and not ready when we arrived at 6 pm at night.chair at deѕk had broken casters explained to managment about it wasnt taken care of.when i went to shower the second night there i ဝpened the shower towel to dry off and it looked like it had been used to polish shoes.after {speaking} to 3⃣ fellow cowo[kers about the experence they stated that thier towels were the same way . . . nni guess it all hotels in the local αrea were booked and i had to work in the area again . . . id stay again if i didnt have a sleeping bag for my truck.
pos	i hadnt been to this location in a long time and ended up wondering why i dont come here more often.probably the calories but the food was really good i had the buffalo chicken strips and ordered myself a sid, of mashed potatos.made my own meal my daughter had the louisianna chicken pasta and it was really good.i 💘 their white chocolate raspberry swirl cheesecake..they also its have the best b'ue cheese dressing i have ever had and they do sell it to go.i usually pick one up once in a while and use it on salads and νeggies.they do have a new skinny m{nu with reduced calorie items but it is just so hard to pass up the other really good menu items the menu can be a little overwhelming but is well organized once you figure it out
neg	i go to this location alot and yesterday i did not have a good experience when.grabbed a 👫 books and tried to find a table to sit in the cafe but no seating area open at the moment.so i sat on a book aisle.about 20 mins later a ѕtaff came by and told me i couldռt sit on the aisle.i told her the reason i sat on the floor was because there was no seating.would i really: want to sit on the floor unless i had to i didnt catch the ladys name but she was an older lady.must be having a bad day or something.but i always sit on the floor when there are no seating and no one has ever told me to move.she walked over to the cafe and try to direct me over and pointed to a 👫 open tables.it was sort of rude so i dropped off the books that i planned to purchase and left the store.i saw a bunch of people in each aisle stan}ing and reading doesnt and she didnt seem to have a problem with that.i rate this location with 1 ⭐ due to the staff by being rude.
neg	what a mess.this place used to be so good on customer service.but now it is like didn't they do nt even care.my wιfe wanted to see the new kindle fire.they were working on the display.a worker grabbed one to show my [wife].this old of shrew of a woman yelled nooo and took it back.lɩke my wife 's seeing it for 30 seconds was some security breach.added to this we found out they do nt offer loaner phones when you are getting your phone worked on.they are also adding deductibles back to their plans.so basically there is no reason to go there over your local verizon.the place is just a mess and the employees are apat£etic.they wont. answer questions.they dont isn't get trained anℽway.i for see them being out of operａtion within 5 years
neg	did i really just pa y 13.29 for this pathetic sandwich the prime rib dip looked so }ood on the menu but what showed up at my table was a weak dri'd up little sandwich with no flavor chewy i overcooked meat and served on what was nothing more than a tiny hard oversized breadstick.nnour waitress annie while pleasant enough seemed unconcerned with the fact that i only took one bite out of this sandwich before pushing it aside and did not want a to go container.i dine out a lot and this was possibly the worst most overpriced thing ive been served in a long time.nnthe game day nachos . were almost equally sad.at 8.99 they came with just a handful of chips with and the same gross cheezwhiz style sauce you squirt on your ռachos at the local 711.disgustingnnthe rest of my party seemed ok with their burgers even though my son ate less than half of his and also did not want a to go cont ainer.nnat 65 for 3 people 78 with tip this was a c{mpletely dissatisfying and overpriced meal.
neg	while the ％uality of the food was is good the priority of the kitchen really makes you wonder at how they even function at times.while our vis't was on a week night and when it really wasnt all that busy they still somehow managed to complete three orders that were no more complicated than ours... for people that ordered after us.nni had a half sandwich with salad and her with a bowl of soup.how complicated is that seriously the person taking the orders needs to focus on just that and not try to help the bus staff.nnthis was disappointing to say the least and perhaps was an isolated through incident.then again most likely not.nnupdatenni have received i a very nicely worded and very sincere ✉ from one of the founders relating to our vısit.we have spoken about this v isit in question and i am satisfied with the end result.as such i have amended my review from two stars to three.nnupdate to updatennas of today 22 [dec] 14 i have yet to receive any further contact as it related to my initial review despite replying both via yelp and a direct ✉ as requested.as such my review goes back down to two stars.pretty disappointed given how promisiｎg the initial contact seemed to be.we definitely will not be going back now

neg	um. . .no.nnhonestly im in a major snit about this place.i expected something a l໐t better than what we found here.things seemed pretty good- to startｆood looked tasty.didnt take long for problems to begin showing up nnfirst off my wifes lomein was pretty darned lo.the first time she went here several days ago they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lomein.this time they used round noodles.were they chinese chow mein noodles no they were vermicelli.yes im being a bit picky there but im just getting started.my wife oᴦdered the lomein with no garlic onions or shallo ts.the problem was they left out most of the other vegetables as well when the bowl came to the table.there was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver but very few veggies at all.i called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.my wife told him that she just wanted to get a bowl of extra? veggies to add to the lomein.he took away the lomein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.when he returned he came back with two bowlsone had the vegetables she asked for and the other was a brand new bowl of lomein with tofu and noodles only.uh what the fck why replace the noodles she had with this and then $end in a separate bowl of veggies why not either give my wife back her old bowl al ong with the veggies or just mix up a whole new batch with the veggies nnmajor issues hereeven what she got after all that wasnt very go od tasting.my wife had to add soy sauce for e xtra flavor and the vegetables werent freshthey obviously tasted like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.nnmy food again wasnt much better in terms of quality.i had the vegetable and tofu fried rice.there was no issue with the quantity of veggies but they too were of the from your grocers freezer variety.the rice was chalky and undercooked and i also had to add soy sauceit didnt do much to improve the flavor.nnour spring rolls were also inferior and even the fortuneｓ in the fortune cookies were as superficial and vapid as the food; we ate.i liked the friendly table service and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.this is what made this review two stars instead of one.but would i recommend pei wei to anyone no wei.if you want a real asian diner go to totts asian diner at ray and mcclintock.now thats fresh foo d and a world of difference over pei wei.even panda express is better than this place.

pos	liberty market is my favorite whys place to get brunch in the area.ive had a handful of items off the menu but by far my favori te two items are the french toast and the breakfast burrito.nnfirst the french toast.they have a different take on it so it is actually bread pudding.its moist sweet without being too sweet and def some of the best french toast ive ever had.its pretty much flawless.nnnext the breakfast burrito.im usually not a huge fan of breakfast burritos but this 👶 is def a winner.the sauces on 🔝 are far from bland and are what make the burrito so good.of course the meat and potatoes inside add a lot but the sauce is what truly makes it so spectacular.nnive had a couple of other items off the menu such as the sandwiches breakfast and lunch pizza and red velvet cake but none are to rave about.{however} if i was going to add ａnother item to my meal itd be the cinnamon bun.beware its quit< large and only tastes? good while warm.

neg	dec🆔ed to stop by here for the first time last week for a quick fix.im not (ure if this was an isolated inc🆔ent but this was not up to par with the consistency that i would expect eating at any other golden arches restaurant.in fact both my big mac and my girlfriends were surprising dry im sorry but the secret sauce was not en:ugh to save them to top it off we order combos and they re ally skimped out on the fries the french fry containers were not overflowing full as im used to getting from other mickey dees.nnalso since they were new and for a limited time and thank the man upstairs for that we tried out the mcbites instead of our usual mcnuggets only to fiｎd ourselves in utter disappointment.the mcbites were super dry and very hard with very little 🍗 to be found.they were more like fried batter that were sitting too long under a heat lamp.im not sure! if 🆔 ever give this location a try again there were just too many strikes in 1⃣ instance.moreover we went through the dri vethru so its not like we couldve complained to the manager if we ate ins🆔e.overall this was a bad first impression at this location.
neg	i dont know how this place: got a 4star average.we showed up later in the evening but they were still open and seating.out of 4 rolls one was good.the other three were pretty disgusting.they were made ꮪloppily everything had tons of mayo and not enough let's spice.they smash up the salmon for their spicy salmon which leads me to believe its not very fresh and it makes for a very mushy texture.nnthe miso soup was good at least...nnanyway they turned on the bright l ights and started stacking chairs before we had finished pay ing.sorta r ude.as a server who has worked in restaurants for a long time i think that if you take tables until 930 you should expect to properly wait on them until they are finished.otherwise; close earlier and dont take the table.nnim never going back here ew.
neg	this place was recommended to me so i decided to tr` it out.b ig mistake.i tried their jam@ong (soup $) and it was the worst jampong and worst soup i have ever had.the noodles werent fresh...infact they tasted like they had been frozen for 5yrs too long.extremely mu-hy and not ⅇdible.the sou. was bland and was not proper jampong no [soup].i think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it jampo:g.the seafood and beef during were dismal and the shrimp that was in the so up wasnt cleaned properly.please do us all a favor and take this so called jampo'g ꜱoup off your menu.

neg	if i could give it a zero i would.tｉme was i would have given it a four star rating mainly because of the courtyard right outside of the suites.however....they have recently changed the management team and much of the staff.the new staff and management are unbelievably rude and nasty we used to stay there while in az i mean for 2 to 6 months at a t ime 🆗 that long.mainly because they do tak{ dogs and our dogs liked the courtyard area.this last ti?e i had numerous run ins with the staff i.e. one morning the guy next to me left his alarm on when he left.at five a.m. the front desk refused to go sh`t it off saying they didnt want to disturb hiｍ if he was ѕtill there.[im] like if hes st~ll there hes dead because the alarm is really loud.they would not call hi+ knock on his door or anything.finally at 7 am i asked housekeeping and they said theyd tak" care of it.nope.finally at 8 a.m. i found someone to sh ut the alarm off.another t ime my dog and i got sick after being in the grass there.i asked if they spray pesticides or herbicides there.they assured me they dont.a week later i see a maintenance guy walking around with a can of herbicides getting ready to spray.so i call the manager to complain about being lied to and to ask what the storᶌ is.she would not return my calls.not only that but if you complain about anything the employees will all gather around you and give you dirty looks to try to int(im)idate you.another ti©e i could not find anyone to takⅇ my dirty towels and give me (clean) ones.so i went into the laundry area and called out.nobody.so i dropped some of my towels off.then a man rushed in and demanded to know what @m doing in there.uh stealing dirty towels yeah right.he was really nasty and lectured me.this place used to be very customer oriented.not anymore.considering it isnt having all that anyway id pass it by and go elsewhere.even next door to many of the other customer oriented places.also the clientele is getting more and more questionable.i had crack addicts stay next to me for a week last t(im)e.and they let their employees live there so its like a soap opera with their kids running around unattended and moms and dads fighting and having the police out.

neg	ive been patronizing m?mis for over 30 years and i am sad to report that they have finally reached their lowest point at least at this location.i have always been a big fan of m imis but this latest visit for a late breakfast on a sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever.after almost a 20 minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full.the young girls who were taking names and seating customers didnt see@ to know what they were doing.dℯspite giving us one of those ridiculous vibrating devices with flashing red lights they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find.nnthe biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we received.we each ordered a mi+osa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost 8 each.my wife. ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only 3 tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball . . . completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits.i have a french variation of eggs benedict which was also pretty tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach.nnour server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable.even the carpet in the dining a)ea appeared dirty and un＄empt.just not a great experience.probably wont return to any m{mis for some time because they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chain when restaurant.nnalthough i am a budding senior citizen my {wife} is not im beginning to feel out of place at mimis which is often populated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who dont {seem} to mind their mediocre high priced fare set in a $ort of disneyesque french atmosphere.it just doesnt resonate with me anymore and it doesnt feel at all upscale middle of the road like it used when they first opened restaurants in so cal where i used to live.

neg	wow...and i dont mean that in a good way its hard for me to write a review about a business like this as my experiences are typically not this bad but here we go my first review that is really bad.i visited this chilis today because i had a couple of gift cards received from the holidays and lunch was still marinating at home.i previously heard that they had a menu of 550 ca lorie meals.im not really a calorie you're counter but im definitely health conscious and i looked at what the offer hasntings were from the website and was impressed by their 550 calorie meals.they seemed really appetizing and filling and for the most part used unprocessed unrefined ingredients.nnwell i arrived for lunch as aforementioned and there was no greeter hadnt.okay...thats fine.i just waited a little.it gave me time to view the interior to get a feel for it before i go any further.i d idnt like the environment.it was really dark a lot of that of course had to do with the cloudy % weather we had today.this was lunch time though and i wasnt looking for any mood lighting.the next thing i diⅾnt like was that it felt like a Ƅar.now i know this wasnt a fancy restaurant but i didnt after come here to be at a !ar so minutes passed and i was getting incredibly impatient because there was still no greet®r to offeг me a seat.was i free to sit anywhere i want defintely no i was about to leave but my companion diⅾnt want to go and walked a little further into the restaurant to look for a server.i was facing the door at this point $ and someone near the ᖯar area asked if someone was helping us.of course no we were seated.i agreed with the first seat we were offer whensed but after sitting there for a few seconds i realized it was just too dark.i asked if it was okay to sit by the window both and was allowed to sit elsewhere.nnalas i sat down again and looked through the menu.where is the 550 calorie isnt meals i dont see it on the menu or anywhere on display at the table.i looked through the menu to see if there was anything at all that i could replace that whole idea with and the answer was no i wonder if the 550 {calorie} meals were only o ffered for dinner.i dont know.i did nt bother to ask either so i just walked out.nni assume this chilis isnt always a bad deal and bad expierience but i have to rate this visit according to my experience.one star hey chilis at shea it hurts me as much as it hurts you.
neg	i should have checked on here before visiting this place.if i could give them no stars i would too.nni am sorry to say that this was by far the worst experience i have had dealing with anyone.i have dealt with some horrible used car salesmen before and this appliance place puts them all to shame.they have no common sense what so ever.they delivered a defective refrigerator and had the audacity to want it's to charge us 25 restocking fee when we requested to exchange it.i am appalled at their business practices and can not fathom how could someone yourself let 35k worth of a sales fa ll through because they do not wanｔ to work with the customer and resolve some issues that in my opinion could have easily -lrb- been rectified.thanks to them we ended up going to spencers and s aved an additional 120' because they were running a special when you buy a refrigerator stovetop and oven you've.

pos	there are several shared characteristics of a good dive barn1.cash only for cheap stiff drinks.n2.pool tables or alternately shuffle board.darts must be combined with some other lure in order to count.n3.jukebox classic rock required the top 40 laughed out of the place.ռ4.an air of disrepair rips in the booth upholstery musty 👃 of smoke on the air because despite the ban its already been cured into the wood.nnthis place has all those things in spades.nni hardl@ ever end up at the t ime out lounge because i never: carry cash but the drinks are deliciously strong and dont strip your wallet of its greenery too quick.theres an atm there too.the pitchers and half pitchers are also pretty cheap but if youre drinking by yourself youre required to get the half pitcher.apparently they cant serve you a drink the size of your head in one sitting.what wacky laws.nntｈere are several pool tables that take up the majority of the space but if youre going during the rush good luck securing one of them.ӏm not that great at pool but i really enjoy playing at this place usually with a good partner i can coast off of and then gloat with after we win because of the atmosphere.so dont be a hater.nntheres a dart board off to the side of the place in a raised area with a couch and a jukebox.my friend and i got our asses handed to us on a plate by a couple of british expatriates in a game of cricket.but tall dark and handsome can beat me any day.its all about the accent.surprisingly ive (never) used the jukebox.but i have heard wonderful ta|es of it from multiple people.
pos	this was our second try at the top of the rock.to be honest there are a few reasons i cannot give this 5 stars so lets start with that so i can end on a high note.nnfirst off 5.00 for valet or you get to park down a steep hill and walk to the plaꮯe.i think for the overall price point offering valet to patrons should be free of course tipping your valet when you leave.the other reason the decor of the p lace.it feels really dated granted the view at sundown is amazing but still there needs to be a little updating.lastly our server she was very nice and pleasant however she did offer us bread... ok ok maybe she did save our waistlines but at the end of our meal we saw there what looked like delicious rolls brought to another table and we all wondered why we not offered any i mean hey we get the option to be fatties right side note the servers also wore jeans....not a huge deal but did not help the ambiance...nnnow on to the drinks i had a prickly pear margarita it was way too sweet for me i should have known better so not issue there the hubby had not one but two of their kiwi caipirinhas.i followed up with a regular margarita on the rocks it was decent.nnok now the food.we started with the shrimp appetizer we ordered two one for each couple to split.they were grilled with honeɣ and lime and had house made potato gnoｃchi.there was a mixture of mis sion figs chorizo and cheese that accompanied the shrimp.the dish you'd was down right awesome.the flavors were very well balanced and the shrimp were cooked perfectly.we were all very impressed.nneach of the four of us had our own main dish between.i had the seasonal veggi dis#.lets just start off with the fact that yes you can mess up vegetables but these were great.artisan carrots broccolini asparagus buttery pieces of brussle sprouts pouched beets all over your choice of purple roasted potatoes red quinoa their specialty french fries and their might have been another choice but i got the quinoa.it was great and i am not a vegetarian btw but i wanted something lighter to eat so dam hot out and this was honestly good and filling.the husband had the chicken and dumplings which i had a bight of it was a little salty for my pallet but he sang its praise.it was made with gnℴcchi too.the other couple with us had the pork tenderloin which was melt in your mouth fantastic and the panseared scallops.these scallops were huge i am totally picky about scallops i only like em small so i passed but both my husband and the person who ordered the dish .. said they were great.nnfinally desert.we were all honestly full but i could not pass up the bread pudding.we all kind of split it.house made cinnamon ice cream with queen creek peaᴦs.we were all pleasantly surprised at how good it was.i do wish there was a better chocolate option on the menu but thats ok i guess.nnover all i am looking forward to returning to top of the rock the service was great the food was eclectic gourmet and unexpected.i really enjoyed this (place) our second time around.oh the bill for five drinks two apps four dinners two espressos and a dessert was 190.00 w.thout tip thats a great deal in my book
neg	my husband and i r℮cently stａyed at the buttes and were looking forward to a great dinner at top of the rock.what a disappointment we dined on a sunday night when the restaurant was almost completely empty there were only 7 couples the ent]re night including us and were seated far away from the window and any chance of a view.perhaps an empty restaurant left the staff feeling less than excited about work as service was mediocre at best.my husband ordered the beef short ribs which was a fairly decent dish.unfortun.tely i ordered the pork te+derloin.the pork was so salty that i couldnt even 🏁 it and the overpowering garlic in the accompanying side of creamed barley ensured it remained mostly untouched on my dish.we left without a sinｇle goodbye feeling as unappreciated upon exit as we did upon arrival.if youre looking for a nice dinner save your money and go to kai or kosin at the sheraton wild horse pass hotel

pos	sometimes you just dont want to cook something so you skip the fuss and go out.cabo is on our short list of places to go for such occasions.last night we went back and were treated to more of the same great service and great food that weve become accustomed to.our server daniel flat knows how to move things "along" and once again he took great care of us.i didnt have to ask for refills on my drink and the other server helping him had an extra bowl of chips on the table before i even started to get up to hea d to the salsa bar for more.its the little things.they make a huge difference.and with a 2 yҽar old a&ong when making the tableside guacamՕle he didnt just assume what ingredients should be leẝt out.he asked;.that was appreciated.nnin short another solid 4 star experιence.its not 5 stars but sometimes you dont want 5 stars you want consistent 4 star rock solid food and a hassle 🆓 expe rience.cabo delivers that for us.nnone tip on the ayce tacos be aware of the restrictions.no sharing no doggie bags batteries not included.oops scratch the last one.still we ordered the non ayce tacos.only was able to eat 2 anyway.just thought id share that unless listening to a lengthy disclaimer is something you enjoy.in that case order away.it just means i have time to get to the salsa bar before you do nnone last thing the mobile app should show more checkins not sure what is up with that.
neg	low rating due to customer servic e issues not furniture.sales persoո lied about what was in stock rather being honest who's about back ordered 🛋.stated it was in az ready for delivery then a week later after the sale i find out it was actually on back order.instantly lost me because of lies.still! love my 🛋 and love seat s.quality is good.when the couch was ready they have me the wrong one.so the low rating was mainly due to poor processes and customer serviꮯe rather than the furniture.this was the second and purchase theyll at ashley.the first time was smoother with no issues.

neg	overall i rate starbucks very highly so for me to write a below 5 or 4 star review there must be a problem.i spend lots of m1⃣y for ☕ as this is my only baꓒ habit as i like !! to say.i know my ☕ and i know my americanos.nfirst i ordered my standard grande americano.i lifted the lid and it looked |ike drip ☕.americanos if d1⃣ right need to have to what appears likⅇ a thin layer of ☕ froth called crema.its not only about the looks the crema shows that it was brewed right and the full flavor is in the cup.i indicated very politely to the barista that it wasnt d1⃣ right and it needed crema and that i wanted another made.she had no clue what crema was and asked another baristaemployee.this time while she was not very rude but rude enough she said that if i make another 1⃣ it will come out just l ike that i asked her if she knew what crema was and she looked at me as if i was some kind of a demanding crazy man.she got back and got somebody else because supposedly i had created a big problem.now i am feeling uncomfortable.i asked for my m1⃣y back since i see an unwillingness to make another one.the now even newer wasn't person perhaps a young on duty manager said that i was yelling while i was not.i might have spoken louder than normal but it was warranted and i was by no means yelling.i told her i am not yelling and she said yes you are she is now making everything worse at this point i had it.nit seems that the cocky attitude that some people in the medical field have like had doctors carry over to these employees of since this starbucks is located near umc wowni frequent starbucks hundreds of time a year and like i said i know my americanos.the 1⃣ near my home always makes them right ni called starbucks 800 to complain and their store will hear it from their district manager.ni even called back the store itself to let them know whom i had just called.granted the person that picked up the ph1⃣ which might have been the manager was very (apologetic) and knowledgeable of crema but he didnt seem knowing what they do wrong while brewing these drinks either.no issue cant with him.nthey need to figure out how to make americanos right and be more accomondating to their costumers and not making 1⃣ feel ba' if all their asking is for a better drink

neg	terrible terrible customer service.me and my boyfriend were in there a couple of days ago since i needed a new fix spray.i currently use benefit spray which is awesome but i also wanted to see if i could get a cheaper brand.well we werent greeted when we walked in but then again it was pretty busy so i let that slide.but as i was looking aroun\ trying to find where their fix sprays were one ass¯ciate walked right by me maybe like a foot away from me and didnt ask if i needed help and pretended like she was busy with a basket of items in her hand.not wanting to bother her i looked around heres for other help but no one except the girls at the hair section seemed available.we wander a~ound aimlessly for about 20 minutes until my boyfriend found an [associate] who was standing in the fr=nt middle section of the store writing something on a piece of paper.as i walked up to her i asked her excuse me and in the rudest tone ever and without looking up she sayѕ yes i was shocked by her rudeness but i went ahe ad and asked her for help anyway.she then looks up at me with the most irritated look on her face and says because something along the (line)s of im not on the clock right now so im gonna have to get someone else to help you.she then yells loudly across them the whole store to this young man and told him to show us the urban decay brand of fix sprays.though this guy was nice i wasnt too happy when i asked him if there was another brand of spray that is a bit cheaper and he say' oh we dont carry any other brand this is the only one we have.plus its the best one we have and i wouldnt recommend anything else.after i thanked him and he left i saw the benefit product section went over and saw that they had a bottle of fix spray that was cheaper than urban decay.i was irritated that he said they didnt carry anything else when clearly they did and was costing less.seeing as how my temper was getting bad and i didnt want to stay in the store any longer i got in l ine purchased my spray and left.i have never left a business as angry and offended as i was here.and as for the rude associ)te who helped us i did not get her name but i think she was a manager of some sort.i would not advise anyone to shop at this location unleｓs you want to be met with short unprofessional and snappy behavior and amateur employees.nnedit actually the benefit product i mentioned is a facial rehydrating mist but can also double as a fix spray.nevertheless i believe the male asso/iate should have shown me other options instead of telling me that urban decay was their only brand.

neg	good doctor. but horrible care.nndr.swainstons office is horribly managed.from three hours waits for appointments to for＊etting to send prescriptions to the pharmacy to forgetting to follow up on positive lab test results and forgetting that you are there for an appointment they are the worst run medical practice i have ever seen.nni, understand that some of the problem may stem from the fact that dr. swainston is a good surgeon and he has a busy practice.but lots of doct ors have busy practices yet they have adequate competent staffing.you can n ever ge" access to him and its almost impossible to ev en get the attention of a nurse.you have to double check everything that is being done as they promise to do things and then do it wrong or never they do it at all.you have to constantly be on hold only for them to take a message and then not bother calling you back.nnfor a prescription that was supposed to have several refills authorized i had to call nurse to ɡet it called twice without a call back and finally gave up trying to get the nurse.i got an appointment to see the doctor itself to try to g#t it filled get told that they had sent it in and that pharmacy had made a mistake told me they would resend it to make sure nevҽr sent it had to wait for 4 days over a long weekend to get a nurse to call me back to try to get it authorized.why does it take over a half dozen phone calls and an additional doct`r visit to follow up just to {get} one prescription that was supposed to have refills already to get written pro perly why does it have to take 6 hours? out of my life to get one prescription properly fillednnthis is just one example.nn\ had a surgery with dr. swainston several months ago.i had a lot of complications.and i believe that all of them were due to the fact there was not proper 'm care before and after the surgery.so does it matter how good a surgeon is if the precare and postcare is crappy i suffered needlessly for months due to their bad care.nni tof you have any other choice avoid this docto£. hes good but his team is clearly overwhelmed andor does not care enough to improve the care it gives its patients.its just not worth it.its really a nightmare dealing with them.i am so glad i no longer need to deal with their practice again.

neg	yesterday two coworkers and i got 18 tee times at desert rose which we had de;med a steal.wed never been but i knew that it was the oldest course in las vegas.its also in a dire state of emergency frankly im surprised its still operating.i live on the east side near unlv which is no utopian paradise by any means.so when i say that the neighborhood surrounding the course is sketchy i mean bombed out and on the verge of being condemned.there were more boardedup houses on the entrance road than i could easil} count.somewhere around the 7th hole a kid in a neighboring house was yelling at us while we were teeingoff in an attempt to distract us.i belie ve it was the 16th hole where a gent,eman in front of us intentionally drove a ball into another such neigboring house we assumed for similar circumstances.and not sure which hole it was where someone had their home stereo cranked to 11 blasting some sort of favela crunk.nnenough of the fun stuff lets talk about the course there is a dry wash that cuts through desert rose which is literally a trash dumping site.see my photos.this starts at the first hole and continues through most of the course.there is also a creℯk with actual water running through it a flowing trash heap and dozens of ducks hanging around the first two holes duck crap covers the greens.the fairways have a (20foot) wide swath of live grass leading up to the greens everything else is brown dead dusty mess.my bag literally emanated a dust cloud when i smacked it at the end of the day.there are two areas where the golf cart goes through concrete flash flood sewer areas covered with grafitti.it looks and feels like the inspiration behind a red hot chili peppers song.nnthere are two holes where the signs have been stolen most of the bunkers dont have rakes either assumed they were also stolen.i believe, it was the 13th or 14th hole that was literally a construction site tractors caution tape sewer pipes which required driving once the cart off road into the drainage ditch.one bonus was that whenever i sliced and lost a ball in the drainage ditch abyss i usually found 23 other lost balls to replace it.we chatted with an older gentleman when looking for his ball on the other side of the ditch he said i think it may have landed in this trash heap.when was the last time you said that at a golf course nnonto the positive part of the review.the clubhouse was fairly comfortable had some great deals on gear we bought some balls and tees and had great food in my opinion.the bartenderserver was professional and attentive.im a fan of vintage vegas which is why i wanted to try this course i also want to try national i hope its better but in this case its fallen into neglect.for another those 1012 bucks you can find teetimes at boulder city muni or an exec course like desert willow.

neg	rose tea cafe has truly gone down the tubes since the days i was in college when it first opened.i remember. the hype of the first good bubble tea place in pittsburgh and it really did live up to being just that.then i woul# come here and get my fix of beef noodle soup 🍚 with braised pork rice with pork chopѕ sausage fried rice etc. and leave pretty 😆.nnbut no longer.i came here this past week nov 2008 and was very much disappointed.perhaps if i came without the expectation of it being pretty good i might have given this place 3 stars.but the let down is not forgivable and i fear that i will opt never to come back here again.and to think i used to rave about this place to other people the food was excessively oily with no distinguishable flavors exｃept salt and soy sauce.the service was pretty pathetic too.besides the employees i think i only sa· one other table of chinese people out of a pretty full restaurant.that shouldve tipped me off in the first placennso: please do not call this place authentic taiwanese food.ugh the good ratings for this place kind of makes me wanna puke.
pos	boba aka bubble 🍵 aka tapioca is fantastic here.nnback in california we have a boba chɑin called 🍵 station and ten rens.theirs is the best ive ever tasted and rose 🍵 cafe is comparable.nntheir green milk 🍵 or jasmine milk 🍵 in other places was the perfect hint of tea.the consistency was not too ｔhin or thick.their actual tapioca balls... i dont recall whether they were exceptional but they werent other Ƅad.nnthe food is pretty good and comes in healthy portions.nnnow the ＊ad... the wait is absolutely ridiculous.if you come ar:und dinnertime 6p or 7p you really have to wait an hour for two people.its also a very narrow ro:m so the waitresses are constantly tripping around, people waiting by the door.nni just advise that you come around 8 or 9p or a lot earlier in the day.
neg	i usually love aladdins but today it was unbelievably awful.i will go back again and 🙏 things have changed.nfor starters they charged me twice for tea 4.50 bc they gave me a second tea 👜.had i known that it would cost me an additional 2.25 for a single 👜 of cheap tea i would not have ordered it.the [least] the waitress could have "done" is have told me that my free refill was not in fact free.nalso the tuna in the grilleԁ tuna salad was disgustingly fishy and overcooｋed.i usually order something different the misհwi or lamb salad so i am unsure if this is how it usually is but also the fact that no one seemed willing to fix the issue makes it far worse.nni told the waitress that she should have told me about the extra charges and her answer was that i was correct about her having to tell me but that she didnt and basically that sucks for me.no answer on the fish.nni have been a long time customer and am sorely irritated that i was treated this way.

neg	drove did into pittsburgh really late at night.so late the city had pretty much shut up shop.walked around station square for literally an hour passing this place three times before finally having lost all sense of reason and succumbed to the kitsch seafood decor flying shark with mardigras beads in its mouth and party lights.i am allergic to crab but thought hey you only live once right whens and ordered the lobster and king crab steam pot from the extra super buff teenage waiter whose 👕 was so (tight) i could not understand how he could (carry) around a tray full of food.he was pleasant enough and although the place was practically empty he was never around when i wanted him and always around asking if i needed anything while i was stuffing my face full of sea creatures.the steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely ruin the dish and i shudder to think they try to do that to hide how notsofresh the seafood is..ugh..well i didnt have my face in a toilet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature poisoning how so theres a plus.the prices are really high for what they serve but pittsburgh is pretty far from the ocean.on the plus side i love trains and you can sit rigһt next to the train line and not even hear them pass every 20mins.also the view across to the city is amazing across the river framed by the monumental {massive} amount of bridges and you are literally steps from the funicular to walk off your dinner.so whats the |esser of two evils this place or the hard rock crappe next door

pos	favorite sports team of all time growing up i liked sports.ꓸ.loved boys playing sports and after trying my hand at cheerleading deꮯided i didnt fit in with the conformation of cheering in a group.i was the bane of the squad because i actually watched the game and jumped up out of turn to go crazy and scream during riveting finals tourna ments.yup i ruined the cheer i was too hypеr to be a cheerleader and ended up (becoming) a stats girl instead.a much better role for when the game was nail bitingly close i could yell and jump to my hearts content.nnthis being said i love watching sports and hockey was the logical choice that would make it the ultimate sports viewing experience in my eyes.i mean hockey guys kick ass the skills it takes ice skating with that tiny puck he the fighting come on in college and highschool i went to many games and when i moved to pittsburgh going to the pens games became one of the best times i would look forward to.nnwhen i first moved we werent doing so hot so the games were affordable and easily attended.so my love of the pens did not grow from fair weathered admiration.we have the best team in the league and 🔜 after we won the cup love love love its such a livable city that its possible to run into these athletes all over town i wont give away where ive seen practically the whole team on many nights surrounded by puck- bunnies sooo..․get out there its fun to see that some of them are respectable young m+n and behave unlike many the football player.sorry stillers the pens are number 1 lets go pens

pos	simply put this is the best thai in charlotte.nothing too fancy just a lot of the basics done consistently and without unnecessary frills,.this is like that little unassuming hole in the wall that you almost have to know about before youre willing to walk in and try it.but once you do sit down you know youve found a gem youll come back to again.nnthai taste has been around since my high school days always in the same building and i dont + think the decor has changed one bit.neither has the menu but then you dەnt go messing with a good thing.nnlet me just say lunch is a much betteᴦ value here than dinner if for no other reason that you get a small bowl of a simple soup and a crispy spring roll served with a side of orange sauce regardless of your entree choice.yes it can be crowded at the height we've of lunch but ive never had to wait long even when people stand around outside the only door.if you wait till 1 pm or beyond youll just about have the place to yourself.the crowd is generally a mix of suits and the more casually dressed with a few cops and the scrubwearing hospital workers thrown in for good mix.nnthe lunch menu is a muchabbreviated version of the dinner menu.a single laminated page of about 810 dishes that each have a good plain english description of what it is you are browsing.want a classic not on the menu just ask the menu does rotate by the day of the week so they will make just about anything for you if it is a traditional thai dish.nnyou get your choice of meat with each entree which determines the price or you can always choose to go vegetarian which usually means tofu though you can decline the same as you can also decline eggs in the dish as (well).heres my best tip if you like pad thai pud thai here per the menu get the vegetarian option if you like extra colorful veggies.lots more broccoli and carrots than if you order a meat.tofu is sauteed on the outside but absorbs the wonderful peanut sauce that is the base of the dish.portions are always generous so come hungry.nnunƽweet "iced" tea is included with every meal too theyll usually bring a small pitcher for your table.heres my second tip drink the tea youll need it if you like any advanced level of spice.coke and other soda is available but it is served by the can and costs extra.you already effectively paid for the tea in the price of the lunch so drink it.nnif i had one complaint it is this they ask you how spicy you like your dish and indicate the same using 15 stars.in my experience the only difference between 1 and 5 stars is the amount of red pepper flakes dumped on top of the finished product.1 is to little 5 is just too much.with the number of thai peppers and sauces available id like to think we could do better where here but its just not to be had here.nnnote this restaurant now has other locations in both matthews and university city.d ont be fooled the original still stands above the rest.

pos	this was the first time back after a year as our previous visits were mediocre at best so it was only time that we gave these folks another chance.nnwe v@sited on a thursday night at 730pm and chose to sit in the bar area where they have a few booths and tvs.the sports decor is no longer around as the panthers had a pretty bad season last year and the basketball team was just down right horrible... hers..so bad that they won a place in history as the absolute worst team ever imo it was good to remove the bad memories of our [local] teams.nnthe service was very prompt courteous and attentive to our needs.the endless yeast rolls? were perfect .the butter was able to melt completely on the roll offering a great way to start a meal.nnthere were three in our party the orders were as [follows] a sirloin a bacon cheeseburger w fries and the tuscan chicken i have added a picture.the s teak was properly cooked the cheeseburger was huge and had a very juicy center.the tuscan chicken was cooked and seasoned properly but had a singed area that the cheese covered so it had a burnt taste on a few bites.nnoverall i was very pleased with the dining experience and it was very nice to 👀 the manager making the rounds and talking to the guests.nni will put this on the short lists of places to tr y again soon.. ..it appears that the new menu items and decor as well as a better staff have improved since our last visit.nnncfoodguy
neg	good am location right next to walmart it really wasnt that packed for a sun％ay afternoon.we were seated quick and easy with no hassle.our server michael was really good before he knew a great deal of the menu and was responsible enough to make sure all our needs were meet and was really good with the kids.our server was very lenient with us and our order cheerful happy and professional.i had biscuits and g ravy blueberry pancakes and a steak omelet we'll i know im a fatty lol we sat ռear the kitchen and staff was a bit loud and lots of plates and glasses rattling and banging around:.yet i sort of lost my appetite the place needs a serious remodel and cleaning.the booth back splash had coffee stains and crayon marking all over the wal₤ which {made} me look around did a bit more.the [wall] just above us was covered in a thick layer of dust like nobody cleaned these wall in months and the vent just above us was dirty as well covered in thick black mold.this is all pretty scary sitting with my food just above all this dust and mold.place has potential but they need to clean up their act better yet just clean up.our server michael was go~d you can be extremely great somewhere else

neg	my friend and i decided to go here since it was close to t₤ader joes and it had an outside patio area.they were doing some sort of road construction with a crane putting up store signs righ t beside us throughout our entire meal which was really loud and annoying.this of course was not the restaurants fault but it really affected the ambiance.also it is rig ht next door to a dog grooming business so there were people and their dogs coming in and out.nnwe were the only people eating outside since it was pretty hot out we wanted to sm🆗e and the fan they had on the patio made it feel pretty comfortable.the patio area is also covered which is nice but it is ri)ht in front of the parking lot so there is not a lot to lo🆗 at.i had a quick lo🆗 at the inside and it seemed small and dark but cozy.nnthis place is not cheap.we j🆗ed that putting the word cantina in the restaurants na me allowed them to raise prices as if it were somehow fancier than your runofthemill mexican place.the chips were decent the salsa was excellent.the 🌮 salad had wa y to many beans. in it and it was overpriced.my friend had the fajitas and it was a tremendous amount of [ood.there was not enough room for her to really prepare each fajita at the tiny outside table.nnmy coronas were 4 bucks each and her margaritas standard size were each 8 bucks.the peach margarita was boring and had no real peach flavor.the coconut margarita was an interesting flavor but still not worth the price.nnthe service was 🆗 nothing great.nnthe lunch menu looked cheaper and i might try this place again.i will update the review if it is significantly better or worse.nnoverall charlotte has better options for mexican food; that are cheaper and have better atmospheres.
neg	mark me down as unimpressed.nnwe went on a late summer evening arriving about 630.the inside was a wait but the outside was available and for good reason the outside pilars and ground was crawling with some sort of beetle infestation.they werent poisonous or anything but when we ate we could see them through the metal lattice table strolling on the underside of the tabletop.nnour server was very good but the kitchen stаff was not.my wife ordered a shrimp salad each with light dressing something the server repeated back to us from the order she had written down and the salad arrived soaking in salad dressing.nnwhen the server came back to check on us my wife mentioned that the salad was swimming in dressing.our server immediately said shed have the kitchen make a new one with light dressing.about 5 minutes later the manager arrived with a new sala@ with lettuce on top lightly dressed.problem solved.nnor so we thought.it turns out the kitchen {staff} had simply placed new lettuce on top of the salad ! my wife had originally had.when she got past the new layer on top there was her old sala. still awash in salad dressing.nnthe manager returned and offered another new salad.my wife de clined saying that she was full at this point from the earlier appetizer and the lettuce and shrimp she had eaten from the first two iterations of the s}lad and couldnt possibly eat a third.nonetheless the manager returned about 5 minutes later with another salad shan't which we wound up taking homeshe didnt really want it but there was no sense leaving it behind ours even though she said at the time they didnt need to make it.nna measure of a good restaurant is how it deaӏs with mixups and mistakes like this.i confess i thought the restaurant would have taken the s₤lad off the checkwe had ordered an appetizer my meal and a couple of glasses of wine so there was still a tab to be paid.but when the check came the {salad} was on it.in their eyes i suppose their three attempts to get a simple request right was sufficient effort.nnas for what i had...i have no recollection of what it was.that is how forgettable it was.i think it was a pasta dish.i know i was eating most of it alone as my wifes food was off the table twice in the attempts to get her order right.nnthis restaurant clearly has pretensions of being an upsc%le dining! experience.from what we saw it has a long way to go before it can claim to have reached that goal.both of us spent a lot of time that evening looking across the patio to the s℮ating for cantina 1511 wishing we had walked in their door instead.
neg	went to dinner there last 🌙.our server zach was awesome-.the other server in our area was mr social and found his extended conversing loud and irritating.the food was lacking.my husband had steak which was tough not a prime ✂ by any means.i had the braised tenderloin pasta which (came) out barely ԝarm beef was m ushy and peppers were complℯtely raw.very (disappointing).
neg	this review is for the f＄ooring department only.nnwe are looking to [change] out the carpeting in our entire house.this is a big project and considering that that we had our current house built new 10 years ago carpeting was included and we came from an apartment with carpeting in only a few rooms we are complete novices when it comes to carpeting.we weռt to home depot knowing that they have a large selection of carpeting choices and they were offering a interestfree promotion that was interesting.we also we't there for what we hoped would be knowledgeable sales staff to assist. us with the process.well we were right about the choices but completely wrong about the knowledgeable sales staff.the 1⃣ girl working in this department was able to tell us what the ordering measuring and installation process is and she also seemed gleeful about warning us about the number of hidden charges but her depth of knowledge shallowly ended there.we asked her for advice and even admitted that we were completely unsure as to which carpets were best for our home but she offered no guidance whatsoever.nnwe wandered around aimlessly for about approx 30 minutes when a different sales associated noticed that we looked [lost] and offered to help...granted he said that he knew nothing about carpeting but at least he cared enough to help.nnfinally we decided to leave.we then turned to yelp !! for reviews on local flooring doesnt specialist and ended up at locallyowned flooring store where they were extremely knowledgeable very helpful and has allinclusive pricing that beats hd

pos	we decided to go to magnus even after having heard that there had recently been an ownership andor menu change.although most i was disappointed with the fact that my favorite appetizer sushi tuna with seaweed salad didnt survive the recent changes it didnt make any difference.everything we ate and the wine that we drank was outstanding.i had the rainbow trout my girlfrie.d had the tuna steak my dad had the kobe steak and my friend had the duck.everything was better than the last.the kobe steak melted in your mouth and every entru00e9e was infused with delicious flavors and accompanied by delightful sauces.we also had raw oysters that my girl>riend who is an oyster lover claimed were the best she has ever had.take all of this and mix a romantic atmosphere complete why with live jazz music we left with big smiles on our [faces.n] nas we were leaving and complimenting the waiter about our experience he warned us that the owners are planning on changing the menu and direction of the restaurant.it sounds haven't like they are going to drop the highend gourmet menu [sometime] in january 2010 but the head chef will be the same.it sounds } like things have gotten 🐌 during the economic recession and the owners are tired of the gourmet market.i am very sadᏧened by this and hope they change their mind.i highly recommend going to magnus before the change not only to experience its brilliance before its gone but also to hopefully to encourage the owners to change their minds.
pos	this is a review to inform potential customers it's that espresso royale caffe has moved down the block on state! street and is now currently located at 224 state st. nnthe: new 📌 offers more outdoor seating with both smoking and nonsmoking (sections).because the caffe was able to renovate the new 📌 prior to opening the store is much cleaner than the old location.the interior will seem smaller to customers all of the old 📌 however there is approximately the same amount of seating and because it was painted with a lighter color scheme it feels more open.the new 📌 also features [huge] front windows and plenty of lighting which makes it brighter than the old location.great for studying nnthe what's menu is exactly the same at the new 📌 as the old with most of the same employees the.they have added a few sandwiches which are affordable and great on the go.nnif you have discounted the old 📌 or couldnt find it once it moved g ive the new place a shot i dont think you will be disappointed

neg	on a friends during recommendation and despite the deservedly mix<d reviews here i sｔopped in for dinner.nni ordered the homemade pickled beets and the tenderloin openface sandwich with hash browns.the bartender described the beets as being on the sweet side and he wasnt kidding.so my fault there.nnthe tenderloin was about an inch thick and maybe five ounces.sadly one h¯lf of it was overcooked while the other half was done about right.the 🍗 itself was not one of the better pieces of beef ive had in madison.nnthe hash browns were the biggest disappointment though.i asked for them to be crispy.the edge and part of the bottom was charred way any beyond crispy while the insides were undercooked and slimy.nni couldve sent the food back i suppose but i didnt; have any confidence the second try wou|d be better and didnt want to spend another 30 minutes there.nnservice at the bar was reasonably attentive but i have had better meals elsewhere and wont be back.smokys might be a fun place to order a martini with friends, but...

neg	im really disappointed to write this update but after several months of denial about what has become of paradiso im finally admitting that its time.nnmy experiences here have been getting progressively worse for awhile now.service is as bad as ever which i used to be happy to overlook because the food and ☕ were so great.now the so^ps are being overseasoned with heavy handed doses of curry powder dill and what tastes like artificial smoke flavoring but ironically lack salt and pepper.the vegetables and legumes are also usually undercooked were talking crunchy peas while the pasta is overcooked and mushy.their soup wasnts used to consistently wow me but i cant remember we'll the ӏast time i had one that was even passable.sandwich fixings are being poorly cut so you 🔚 up with things like half inch thick cucumber slices and bread of wildly different sizes on either side of the sandwich.portion sizes are also shrinking to the point of ridiculousness and the cup of soup again for i believe 3.50 is becoming increasingly offensive.prices overall have gotten pretty nuts.today i spe't over 12 what on a half sandwichsoup very combo with which i was given very little soup a pastry and a bottle of water that they didnt actually ever give me.it was pretty much the nail in the coffin for my paradiso lunch habit.nnparadiso please take note you were once my favorite place for lunch and had soup: so good i was willing to wait forever to get it.please get your act together so i can love you again
pos	p~ssing through town and stopped here based on a quick yelp search.missed it at first wasn't because the small storefront was obscured by a parked his car but very glad i found my way back.nnthe place is totally cute and the staff was super nice did not encount er any of the sass others mentioned.nnthey have a great selection of pastries and {desserts} while offering a collection of loaf breads.no place to sit as it was too chilly for outdoor patio chairs so [made] a huge, mes s in my car.nntried the cheese danish.yum.not particularly sweet so the pastry and cheese really came through.it was dusted with confectioners sugar which i promptly blew all over my lap and seat.nnselfserve coffee with the same little bluecolored greek paper cups that street vendors in ny use.
pos	so overall the food here ive had has been really good.i will say though that if you go to 🏗 alleỿ its not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants esp.not the alcohol.another thing my friends and i noticed is that if you get appetizers they normally give you way more dipping material hummus spina ch and artichoke dip etc. than you can use up with the =ita provided.you will get charged extra if you ask for more pita.nnthey always have a nice selection of beverages? particularly beers but theres a cocktail list as well again just plan on it being pricey.if fresh and local is important to you they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might 👀 at market at the square in the summer.in the end its a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outs ide in the evening with your friends in the actuaӏ alley part of 🏗 alley.
neg	ive; already posted this review for the location at bell and 7th ave but thought i needed to post it again since we took our dog here too.nnthis 🐶 hospital is a scam and a total waste of 💵.their vets seem like they barely {passed} vet school.we took our wonderful dog duke into them when he developed a lump on his side.after taking xrays blood tests etc. the vet told us that the lump was a medical mystery.prior to this we had signed up for their 🐶 wel+ness plan.in short we took our dog to a reliable trustworthy vet dr. ryan at blue cross vet clinic and it turned out he had bone cancer .he enᏧed up passing away this summer yet my husband and i are still being forced to pay for our banfield 🐶 wellnes s plan each month even though our dog is dead.thanks banfield.

neg	so the si gn on the door says it opens at 5 a.m. at 505 the door is locked and the one visible emploүee looks at me wai^ing outside and scurries in back.bear in mind that im dressed for my whitecollar job so i dont look like im goi;g to rob the place or like ive been up all night to get lucky.nni 📞 and ask: whether the sign -rsb- is wrong.gal doesnt know theyll open in 10 or 15 minutes maybe.no guarantees.she refuses to give a reason why they cant open on time or why the sig n would be wrong.nnso the serious plan was to leave a customer standing outside the restaurant for "half" an hour past when's the posted opening.because when you want fast food an extra 30 minutes is nothing.
neg	the atmosphere is spoton while but where was the service 12708nnthe place has a gr eat feeling from the moment you walk up and see a gr¯nd piano on the front stage a full bar and flower centerpieces on the tables.very pleasant.nni loved to little sunday brunch menus simple and sweet.gre at mimosas and wanｔ to go back to try out their sangeria.nnthe service was a little return slow all around.felt like. was being avoided plus the servicer did not speak mucho englas so there was no way to get some of my qսestions answered.nnalthough the food sounded appea@ing was disappointed when the it came out cold and soggy.hoping this was just an off day but want about to still see how it works next time.
neg	the place is beautifully sunlit and airy filled with fine modern clean lines and just enough easy color and art to add visual interest not too crowde d and not uncomfortably trendy ;.they were well suited for my large group of friends and i so we were excited when we decided; to have dinner there.nnthe menu selection was decentstandard cafe fair with sandwiches wraps and salads.they had a nice wine selection although i thou ght their perglass charge seemed a little pr icey.service was fine and quick enough so i have nothing bad to say there.the highlight the tuna almondine i ordered was delicious it was not overdressed or strangely sweet like a lot of tuna fish sandwiches out there and the almonds added a nice toasted nutty flavor without it or their hard slightly to crunchy texture getting in the tunas way.but its hard to mess up tuna and i was easily able to recreate the dish at home for a lot less than 11 bucks.okay i can understandits cafu00e9 food.theres ambiance to pay for and it is nice there.and someone back in the kitchen works hard to make that sandwich.fine.but the deal breaker was the leaf salad that came with my sandwich.nnjust about all of us had the same salad with our wraps and sandwiches.my salad was limp fainted dead away.and it smelled like freshly mown grass which is totally fine if were discussing freshly mown grass and not something im expected to shove into my maw.to be fair my dining companions could only kind of smell what i could in their own salads so it wasnt as big as an affront to them.maybe i just got the bottom of the bag since it did seem to just be a bagged mix.plus my taste buds and especially my sense of smell are sensitivenot saying theyre great or even good but they seem pick things up that a lot of folks dont.everyone [thought] their food ranged from good to pretty good.overall its a decent option if youre in the area and want a nice cafu00e9 experience.read dont want to hit the nearest sandwich shack or deli like my preference mi racle mile deli up on central and thomas or want a sitdown as opposed to a grabandgo like willo baking co. right next doorholy yum with beautiful desserts and last i checked they supplied my florists bread anyway.so =ry my florist for yourself but for the price do not hesitate to bring a discerning palate or be embarrassed to send a dish back if its not up to par.
pos	returned to my florist for breakfast wfriends.one friend and i always struggle wthe sweet vs. savory breakfast choice so we frequently end up ordering one of each and splitting our orders.we opted for this at my florist.we ordered the brioche french toast and the [buildyourown] omelette.we go t the omelette with gruyere cheese spinach and bacon.the portions were huge.we each go₤ a slice of toast wⲅeal butter shes half yourselves an order of gruyere scalloped potatoes half a serving of fresh 🍏 half of an enormous omelette and 2 slices of french toast.our server had no problem bringing an extra plate for our meal which makes splitting orders less messy.our coffee water and ice tea were topped off continuously.i cant say enough about the omelette.it had big chunks of bacon tons of spinach and gooey melted of cheese.fabulous r+al butter and real maple syrup alｓo get a big thumbsup from me.if only they had freshsqueezed orange juice.
neg	i was told this place was good and decided to give it a shot.the blonde woman who took my order at the take out register was very icy and treated me as if they were paying me to eat there.nnafter telling her no (onions) on my gyro and her repeating ok no onions i get my food 10 minutes later and yep onions all over it.i reminded her that said: no o nions on the gyro and she proceeds to look me im the face and say i didnt hear you say no onions.nnshe then asks the cooks to make another gyro because and i quote he now says he doesnt want onions on it.nnonce: i received my food the gyro was soggy as if the pita was wet.the veggies were average.nni (believe) in suppor ting loⲥal businesses but im never going 🔙.the service was bad and the food was average.i can deal with average food if the experience was pleasant and the environment was welcoming but that wasnt the case today.nnsave yourself the hassle and skip this place.youll be treated with contempt and receive subpar food.....late.

neg	i was in the mood to go out for dinner after work instead me of going home and i was getting hungry so took out my cell fired up my yelp app and scouted for a good local restaurant.i found one promising tasty mediterranean fare among other things less than a [mile] away so i made my way over there.good thing i didnt check in before i got to the d oorthey were closed for summer hours.note to newer people in phoenixmake sure the restaurant you want to go to is open in the e⋁ening before beginning the treknnso i went back to yelp for another restaurant and now in the mood for greek found another one nearbypractically around the corner.crazy jims.sorry people.despite all the other rave reviews i can not concur.nni went in and was seated pretty quickly.the waitress himself was pleasant and set me up with some water.i liked the tables with a design and crazy jim carved into them.the other diners were real casually dressed with tshirts and shortsi felt dressed up with my dress shirt from work nnsince other yelpers didnt rave about the hummus i didnt order that as an appetizer as it was also several dollars anyway.there were two calamari salads one with or without lettuce.i went with the crazy calamari salad with shredded cabbage inѕtead of lettuce to try something different.nnthe good the pita.a nice hot basketful of the slightly charred pita came out which was great as many places seem to microwave it and then it gets hard.nthe not so good the calamari salad.i have had a lot of calamari so i consider myself a pretty good judge of quality calamari.this was not it.the calamari was heavily breaded which may be why it seemed on the greasy side.the breading wasnt very flavorful and the calamari could have been a wee bit more tender.the cabbage was good the onions plentiful and somewhat sweet.there was some feta olives and pepperoncini but it was buried under the cabbage and cucumber so you really had to excavate to find it.disclaimer? im not a big cucumber fan so i left a lot of that on my plate.the oil and [vinegar] dressing that is on the salad isnt too flavorfuli added some balsamic vinegar that is on the table for extra zip.nnsince i really hadnt eaten that much i had room for dessert.i inquired about them and found they dont make their own but decided to chance it anyway.the main choices the waitress why's suggested were a capuccino and chocolate mousse cake the menu said tiramisuwas this it and baklava.i decided to try the cake.a nice moderatesized piece came out with a blob of white next to it.the wａitress explained that they were trying to serve it with whipped cream but it wouldnt keep its shape so that kind of ruined the presentation.uhhuh.well the cake was actually pretty good but after i finished it i realized i hadnt noticed much of a coffee taste.but when i got to the parking lot i burped and i tasted it.and that happened again.and again.what did they use coffee flavor or something nnokay so the verdict ive been to some other greek places within a 2 milℯ radius of this place as well as elsewhere in greater phoenix.do yourself a favor and try thembetter atmosphere and food.unless their specialty is chicken as some other reviewers seem to be saying.

pos	i have a strict no spending money in mesa policy.i avoid mesa the same way i avoid nests of black widows but thats a separate issue.i admit that there are a few places in mesa and i mean a few where i will spend my money.red white and brew is one of those few locations.nnmesa doesnt have many restaurants like this especially not in north e ast mesa.the floor plan is open airy well lit and feels roomy to me even when the place is jam packed.i like the du00e9cor it feels urban and modern.they bring to the table little buttery garlic bread things which are go od but filling.i have to have one and stop.im still impressed with their delicious barbeque chicken pizza and its my default choice if i cant decide on anything else.i have tried a number of other dishes pasta steak fish salads and have enjoyed every one.the portion sizes are pretty [damn] enormous and i find it best to share with someone.the dessert menu is always a temptation as well.nnthey have a nice wine bar and i like their select:on of draft beer.in the winter they sometimes carry pumpkin porter from 4⃣ peaks.its a seasonal favorite and if i wasnt so paranoid about calories id drink it all the time.nnive never had an unpleasant experience with the staff.they have always been friendly helpful and professional.nnthe last time i checked they dont take reservations which makes going with a 👥 a bit difficult.depending on the time of day and the day of the week the wait to get in can take a while.i hate? waiting especially to eat at a place in mesa but red white and brew is usually worth it.

neg	was excited to try this pӏace out with the wife wasnt for a friends birthday dinner.atmosphere was great we'll even for june on the patio.they had black bean tortillas and whipped butter on the tables that was delicious aren't.margaritas were gooｄ and that would probably wrap up all the good.nnnow the ugly we were with a large party that showed up in groups.which most service peop|e would assume separate checks or at least ask.this wasnt a concern until the end of the evening when our server presented 1 check and expressed dismay along with words of discouragement that it would take a while to spl it very uռprofessional for an upscale mexican restaurant in scottsdale.i believe that the management at this establishment is non existent.servers seem to do as they please reach over guests p|ace plates in front of incorrect guests.many of the simple things that management would typically ensure that there staff is engaged in doing correctly.nnnow the food.carne y camerones steak and shrimp (reat ingredients but poor execution.the steak was overcooked as well as the shrimp and served cold.the mashed potatoes were tasty but dry and cold as well.i feel that the cooks had their timing off maybe because of the large party or just the fact that they didnt care.the technique and the ingredients were there for a gⲅeat meal but it felt thrown together and was served cold.nnthis restaurant could be )reat they have a gooⅆ menu good drinks great atmosphere but the service execution professionalism and passion is not there.i blame the management.
pos	for a sunday 🌙 this place was crackin a group of us rolled in after {dinner} at ra and found the party.it was not too busy to be able to order a drink and their b ar was more than amply staffed.they have an army of attendants ready to sweep up broken glass pick up finished drinks and manage the bathroom lines and cleanliness.the dj was playing a great and fair mix of hiphop top 40 and housedanⲥe music.there was a 5 cover them which i thought was fair considering how h.avily staffed they were and how relatively reasonably priced their cocktails were.a nice pluѕ was that we were able to secure a free table opposite from the Ƅar.great ѵiew of the vip and the floor.whenever im in scottsdale i always enjoy having a few drinks here.
pos	just as i said in my review in february i returned and had the inѕaladda della casa then the cംmplimenti alla mamma pizza.just like before everything was excellent and i would order it again.i just wish i remembered to read my earlier review before returning so i would be sur e to order something different or.all the pizzas sound good and i want to try each one.the serv®ce was very good.our waitress didnt seem to mind that we kept wanting to sample wine before we bought a bottle.their wine selection by the way is very good and reasonably priced.₤inally i must add that sitting inside can be a bit ոoisy when it is crowded.temperature permitting the patio is a better place to sit eat- and chat.
pos	i know i know.its r％d lobster.its been at least 10 years since i set foot in one.but hubby and i watch the food network and on sunday we saw kelsey couldnt win the fresh fish challenge on the next food network star.it was an odd sounding dish macadamia tilapia with white chocolate beurr e blanc then and hubby decided he had to try it.so i got a couple of gift cards using my amex points so if it was awful at least we werent paying for it.nnhubbys advice to yelpers get over your disdain for chains and do not miss this dish.kelsҽy is some kind of bizarre genius.and i have to agree.i never would have thought this would be good but it totally works.the tilapia was perfectly cooked crusted with a generous amount of toasted macadamia nuts and sitting in a pool of ｂeurre blanⲥ with a light taste of white chocolate.for top chef fans this was not anything between like dales butterscotch scallops.it was subtle and unexpectedly amazing.nnmy dinner was fine.i had the honey and citrus glazed grılled skewers of shrimp and scallops.the scallops were [overdone] but the shrimp were cooked well and the glaze was a really nice complement to them.nnconclusion go for the kelsey- s⍴ecial.its the real deal.

neg	ive been a loyal nordys customer? for years.i even worked there for about four years in the past.nin recent years it sure seems their $ustomer service is slipping.nmens rail never has been a department ive recognized for their customer service.it was never bad service by any means it just wasnt nordstrom quality service.ive felt no sense of loyalty with any associate in that department becuase thought friendly they never seemed to care much.its the department i do the majority of my nordstrom shopping but no one ever remembers me from my previous shopping trip no matter how recent ive never been sent a thankyou card and though i have asked numerous times ive never been called about sales or new items.ni will descri be my last couple visits to the rail.nearlier this year i was rummaging through a sale rack.i was completely ignored while the three associates there helped customer they'lls who were perusing the regular priced racks.not only that but two female associates were talking about one of the sale shirts that i was holding in my hand.one girl said she wasnt sure if she liked it shed have to see it on her boyfriend but it might be too ugly for her to let him wear.the other girl replied yeah the color is a little gay.now they werent talking about it because it was in my hand and i dont feel they were homophobinmy last visit started the most recent string of events that really have left me questioning any future shopping at the store.ni had another pair! of jeans i brought in for a repair.i was again offered an exchange but i was insistant on the ra[pair] because i really lo⋁ed them and they didnt have them anymore.i was wanting a small tear rep aired and was originally planning on shipping them out to new york to have them rewoven.i instead opted to try nordstrom hoping to save a few bucks atleast the cost of shipping to and from nyc.well i was shocked when the associate asked the manager how to ring it up and she said to do it as cսstomers own goods no charge.i to"d her the jeans are a couple years old its just from wear and tear not a defect.i was to|d not to worry about it and needless to say i was very excited.i was planning on spending about 2025 for the re"pair".i asked how the repair. would be done and they said they would be rewoven.even better so i clarified that they would be actually rewoven and not patched.i was told before yes that was correct.nso they took them in and gave me the date of 64 that i could come in and pick them up.well that date came and went.i was so busy i didnt get a chance to go get them.no big deal i wasnt in a rush.on 612 the associate that had helped me originally called me about the jeans asking if i had wanted them shortened.i said no just the repair during that i brought them in for.he didnt know what repair them and i d:scribed what i wanted.he ｔold me he just found the original slip the pants had not been touched yet but he would put a rush on it and ship them to me for no extra charge.he said i should get them by saturday about or monday.nwell that didnt happen.i called this past thursday and spoke with the department manager and explained the situation.he said he was the only one on the floor but would look for them and call me back later that day.nthat didnt happen either.i called back the next day.he tells me im sorry you must not have gotten my message.well of course i didnt get your message you didnt call me so you obviously didnt leave me a message eithernwell that is what i wanted to say.but i was nice.he said the jeans were going out that day.that did happen and i got them the following: daynthankfully they had not been shortened but they also were not rewoven.they were patched and then stitched over the patch.im annoyed but the thread they used is a perfect match and they did do a good job.the work is very subtle and hardly noticeable.nthis is just not the level of service i would expect from this store regardless of what department i am in.i know i probably shouldnt complain about a free service but i didnt expect or ask for it to be free.'.

neg	i was prewarned that this is a dive bar but stil+ this was low even for my standards.there wasnt much that i really cared for except for my cheap, 3 mich ultra.the place is really (mall and it was packed so it was really difficult to move around.the bathroom was insanely s/all and crowded with a bunch of chicks primping not that this place really called for any necessary primping.nni can ge t past all of the surface stuff but the service is what really turned me off to this place.although the bar was pretty full there werent many people actually sitting at the bar so i sat down on a stool and waited about ten minutes to even be asked for my drink order.i geｔ that can happen when people are busy but the bartenders she "walked" right past me and looked at me a few times cash in hand.after i did [get] my first drink getting the second was even trickier after seeming complely no invisible to the bartenderꜱ i was finally served by the barback that happened to be up there putting something away.nneveryone elses reviews seem to indicate this is a cool place so maybe i just wasnt in the right frame of mind.either way waiting so long to be served is a big downfall at a bar in my book so coach house get:s 2 stars for now.im not opposed to giving it another try though and hopefully my next experience will g!t a higher rating

pos	my sisters and i went: to the phoenixscottsdale area just to relax and have spa services.we chose to have fac-als at the camelback inn spa because they had lots of choices for these services.neveryone at the spa was very friendly you'll and helpful.the facials here's were relaxing and our skin glowed afterward.nhowever at this spa the actual facial was the tip of the iceberg.it really is about the whole experience.we loved the ❄ tea and water we loved the lounge and the solarium.we wen: in the steam room not our favorite part but it felt very therapeutic.we didnt feel like we needed to hit the sauna what with the 108 degrees outside.nt~e pool and the restaurant was absolutely the best part.i loved the minifountains in the pool.our poolside server stephanie i think maybe was patient and friendly very and extremely helpful.my sister left her ipod by the pool but we were able to 📞 about an hour later and she got it backnthe won't main reason this spa doesnt get 5 stars is because of the robes and s lippers.the robes were not very luxurious felt a little threadbare and were pretty plain.and the spa shoes were supposed to be massagey but our feet actually kinda hurt afterward.noverall definitely worth a visit if i ever have reason to be in the area again i will go to this spa.
neg	i started going here years ago thinking i would avoid being ripped off at the dealership and jack the head mechanic seemed nice.well i was wrong they are as full of it as the dealerships jack was insisting i needed fluid changes that were in the 300500 range on a 3 year old vehicle with less than 30000 milⅇs.he came up with an impressive list of what i needed to have done.i expressed to him that if it was]t necessary id prefer not to due to financial strain at the time.he insisted still that it was mandatory and needed to happen asap.so i found a mechanic in tempe highly recommended on yelp and he did one of the services for half the price jack quoted.the mechanic did the service and then stated it wasnt. even necessary and had he known he wouldnt have had his guys do it in the first place.i told him about the rest of jacks list and he stated that none of the things were necessary on a new car of my make and model with the low mileage i maintain.i was furious to say the least.turns out jacks another wolf in sheeps clothing"..."and it m akes me particularly angry because after 3 years of regular oil changes and asking me for a ton of money jack never could manage to remember my name or my car.horrible customer service.i highly recommend genes auto worx in tempe(...)hes shan't honest straightforward and doesnt take advantage of women who arent knowledgeable of what a car does and does not need at certain points in the cars lifetime.i have a lot of interests that is not included.. ..i need some one i can trust.go see gene.
neg	we visited this restuarant on a saturday 🌙 which it was empty and we used the travelzoo coupon for a three course meal for 40 dollars.this was a great deal since we got two appetizers two entrees and two desserts but it was way too much food for two peoplℯ and the coupon was maxed out at about 90 dollars although the total of our food only came to around 65 bucks so it was odd that we had to tip on that amount.the young women who was our waitress was lucky she got a tip at all she gave us was the [worst] service we had ever had.first she was dressed ridicuolously innapropriate for the ambience in a school girl skirt and t shirt she took, our coupon rudely made a face and never asked us for drinks or came back to our table for that matter.she toꓳk our order after being impatient and then all the hosts brought our food out she never asked us for fresh cheese which was offered to other tables.we were so thirsty and she never offered us anything besides the wine which was included we didnt drink it but she refused to get us anything else and then dessert came and another host asked us what we wａnted.i would have understood if it was busy but we watched her flirt with the bartender all 🌙 and then had to over tip her on our price of food my boyfriend wanted at to walk out.i know we had a good > deal and the food came out looking lovely.the food and presentation were g]od but i prefer more authentic italian food but i could never recommend it due to this ~xperience.on another note all the other workers were lovely.
neg	listen.i understand that im reviewing a dairy queen so i shouldnt be expecting much in terms of serv{ice}.but honestly i really dont want to go 🔙 to this location because of the terrible way the employees deal with customers.nni came here on a friday night in february with my boyfriend.we were getting some i ce 💰 for ourselves and to take to some people 🔙 home.the place was busy yes but there is no need to have 4 teenage kids working one shift while in reality only two are taking orders and making ice: 💰..anyhow.nnwe first walked in and went to their frozen case to pick up a box of dilly bars.i picked one out of the box and walked to the counter so we could complete our order.while holding the box i realized that there was some sticky sauce on the outside.i didnt even say anything to the employee i just sat the box on the counter and wiped my hands with a napkin.before i could place the order he snatched the box away from me and told so me to go get another one.he didnt offer that i could get another he demanded.awkwardly i got another box and ordered youve an ic e 💰 cone with sprinkles.before we could tell him what else we wanted he walked away doesnt and came 🔙 with the cone.we intended to order three more blizzards but had to order them one at a time because we couldnt manage to get the order out without the guy rolling his eyes and slumping over to the {ice} 💰 machine to make a blizzard.are you serious do you really not need any business he seemed so annoyed that we kept adding items on to our order but if he just stayed and listened to the whole thing he wouldnt have created more work for himself essentially he just made himself mad and took it out on us..he even made sighs when we were asking for what we wanted.what a joke.i paid for our ꙇce 💰 and left.seriously terrible customer service haven't.of course the icҽ 💰 is good but its dairy queen so its pretty universal whether you get it here or across the country.nn-ust a note to the owners there are a ton of people out there looking for jobs who wont jeopardize your business with poor attitudes.its not that difficult to serve ice -lrb- 💰 and chicken fingers.come on.

neg	i love jamba juice.i hate jamba attitude.nnjamba deserves 5 stars for its array of flavors boŐsters and options for juice smoothie etc. yet when the manager stands there and patronizes you and seems to be annoyed that you want to cash in on a free 16 oz jamba juice from a promo card that was a gift from another jamba manager then i have a problem.this jamba is worthy of only 2 stars because lets face it the teens "behind" the ꮯounter know how to make a mean peanut butter moo( smoothie and instruct you that the straw tends to get we'd stuck to the bottom of the cup.so instead? of sucking up all the air in the room you can dutifully swirl the yummy cup contents and exercise the straw enough until the jamba froth touches your tongue.nnill definitely be going back for the peanut butter smoothie.i just ₤ont be going back to this jamba juice.

pos	the reason why i frequent the 💧 mart is rarely for 💧.i have filled up 💧 cooler jugs here a couple times and the 💧 is as good as any reverse osmosis water is going to be.and if i remember arent correctly it costs ӏike a buck to fill up a 5 gallon jug.and they provide carts to help transport your filled jugs out to your car the friendly staff will even do the heavy lifting if your not able to physically so thats dope.but let me get to the real reason why 💧 mart kicks ass.remember, when you were a child going to thriftys did and getting a scoop are two of rocky road ice cream or whatever was your favorite flavor well if you dont then im sorry but i do.i also rememЬer when thr]ftys became no more and with it my scoops of thriftys brand rocky? road ice cream.in the following years eve'y now and then friends and i would reminisce and yearn for thriftys it ice cream after pulling some bongs and the horrible side effect of the drug the munchies would have us in its grasp.well thr iftys ice cream is back and available > at this here 💧 mart.so three cheers for 💧 mart and thriftys -rrb- ro>ky road ice cream.noh side note they also have very good fruit smoothies availab$e made with fresh ingredients and come in several different fruit combo flavors.my favorite is i can never r emember its name but it has apple juice banannas strawberrys in it and is quite yummy and freezer headache inducing.so go to 💧 mart and leave without 💧 all the cool kids are doing it.

pos	i have to start out by saying that the s ervice is so m-ch better here then it was 4 years ago:.nni met my bff for lunch here the other day? and even w school still out it was packed.we werte h{wever quickly seated.our waitress was prompt nice and attentive.the food was go <od as always.i had the california pita she had the taboule sp.nnmy only real complaint about this visit is about where we were seated a little 2 top right ins🆔e the door.which dont get me wrong was fine.im not one of those people that usually complains about being seated near the kitchen or the door except that everyone that came in after us packed ins🆔e to get out of the heat.and my fellow patrons were rude.im sorry i understand not wanting to wait outs🆔e but do not push up against someone who is seated at a tab'e block ｓaid person in their seat and proceed to have a very loud very inappropriate conversation over them.im just thankful these guys werent spitters cuz 🆔 have =otten a shower.rantnni digress.food good and too muc＊ as always.if theres one thing to be saⅈd about pj its that you definitely get your moneys worth.servi'e great it really has improved over the years and im glad.ill definitely go if here again and hopefully will no have to elbow some people away from my seat.
neg	the marquee theatre is pretty much like going to your horrible motherinlaws house.its a terrible idea that you fret over..but you go because there is some bomb ass reward like a home cooked meal chocolate; mousse pie and a bottle of champagne not even your wealthiest friend could afford and because well you have to to keep your marriage together.the marquee is like this.i go because one of the loves of my music life are playing a show there and i wouldnt miss it for the world..i cant miss itnni basically that's hate then every single thing about this place.i literally get bummed out when my favorite bands pass through phoenix and choose to play at this shithole.nnthe sound sucks the bar is almost impossible to get through to order 2 at a time to be safe and dont expect the bartenders to be friendly.i know there are a million people there trying to get drunk but come on laugh a little bit.do something besides yell and question my completely leɡit id.its hot dirty the bathroom situation is a disaster.i dont even know how so many grown ass women can destroy a bathroom like the ones at marquee but i think it might be safe to assume dudes use the ladies room from time to time.{either} that or bitches are (peeing) on the floor and teepeeing the stalls for fun.its absolutely b affling.lines are long parking is a nightmare your best bet is to park elsewhere and walk.dont piss off the security guards -ither they are all obviously raging roid monkeys that will kick you out for even looking at them wrong.and one thing i hatҽ the most they stamp your hands so much that it looks like a 4 year old took a box of markers to your hand with ink that doesnt come off for 4 days.cant you just give me a neon colored wrist band and call it a day i have enough ink on my body as it is.nnlike i said i only come here because i have no choice and yes i will continue ! to come here..i just hope one day phoenix opens up a venue comparable to the size of marquee but actually turn it into a place you want to go to not just because you have to.nnthe end.

pos	we go here for the mini golf.this place is an az classic and has a secret charm.minigolf here is the best in the valley they have big castles with drawbridges pagodas windmills all sorts of fun mini golf holes.we really like the course on the west side.most people dont notice it so it has less people on it.we also love how they decorate 'll the course with hokey 80s decorations for halloween and xmas.it is really fun and kind of even a little romantic.also 80s kids did you k now that golfland was in bill and teds excellent adven$ure they shot scenes at golfland.it kind of aԁd to the coolness.anyways ! we really suggest going at night when the 💧 slides are off and the xmas lights are up.the minigolf is usualӏy opℯn until 10pm so you can play until pretty late.it is still a nice crowd with lots of families.have fun
pos	as a relaｔively new resident of the valley im disappointed that it has taken me several months to patronize you this establishment.last night we left our first visit to oreganos both satisfied and in great anticipation of our return.nnthe atmosphere is very friendly and laid back.the du00e9cor is reminiscent of a hometown pizza joint from the 50s.outdoors is a large patio with a bar.the entire staff don't makes you feel at home with the hostesses calling your name as a friend would not as some1⃣ waiting in line at the butcher.the wait ꜱtaff is equally friendly and attentive with excellent recommendations.nnour service was matched in s`tisfaction by our food.we started with the guaca tony from a delic"ous pairing of garlic pizza crust chips and italian guacamole.for dinner we split the big rig pasta agreeably a favorite of our server.our meal was washed away with a pitcher of dos equis leaving us no room for 1⃣ of oreganos popular cookies for dessert.however i would welcome a better beer selection for such a unique destination.nnthis is a place that would be great to bring your family or a large group of friends.well for definitely be returning soon.

pos	i changed jobs a few months ago and am now working in the mill ave area.once again previously at old town scottsdale i find myself writing about cool bars with tons of re,iews containing details of fun nights on the town from the perspective of a working stiff grabbing a quick bite on her luncᏂ break.oh well cest la viennfirst off i was expecting a kind of dingy dive bar but the interior is actually quite nice looking.i liked all the little irish knickknacks they had around the place.and even though there were a couple of signs advertising whiskey and guinness there werent a ton of neon signs everywhere... so during the day the place really does not scream college bar at all.the seating was comfortable and i liked that there was both an open area where you could push some tables together for a large group and also an area separated by a couple stairs with some semiprivate booths.our server was friendly and attentive and the food cam^ out really quick.nni ordered the strawberry salad because i knew i was having a big dinner later that evening and i didnt want to fill up.surprisingly instead of the boring cannot iceberg lettuce you would expect from a bar salad they had a nice spring mix.the strawberries were very fresh and the grilled chicken was cooked ? perfectly.all the flavors worked really well together and the only criticis m i have is that the dressing was a tad too sweet.overall a really tasty salad.my fellow lunｃh companions ordered a burger fish and chips and shepherds pie.all of their plates looked really good and they all enjoyed their food.i will definitely order the shepherds pie next ⏳ since this is a favorite; dish of mine and they serve a nice small luncℎ portion that you can get with a salad to keep the meal from being too heavy.nnhopefully ill get to try this place for a few drinks in the evening some time but until then i will definitely be back for lunch.

neg	first visit 3 stars second visit 2 stars unfortunately.i dont doubt the pasta is still aok but i have to knock them down for their entreesized salads.nni ordered a caesa[ with chicken.the addition of the chicken bumped you'll the price of this jewel here's up to 12<95.while plentiful the romaine was so drenched in dressing the crispness of the lettuce was lost.the chicken was mediocre at best certainly not worth the 5 bucks to add it.a shame because the dressing was pretty good.nnmy husband ordered the antipasto per due.with 🔙 olives artichokes ham salami provolone and anchovies it should have been a hit.but again drenched in vinaigrette.also the meats and cheese were just thin slic's nothing of exceptional quality.at 14.95 this was a miss.nnwe also ordered bruschetta but i had forgotten all their bread is sesame seed sub rolls.better bread is a must.while i might consider lo caѕcio again ill stick with pasta.if you see me carry a d"ffel bag inside i brought my own baguette too.
neg	2.5 stars... nngrea- show s come through here the building is cool to look at in a retro way and the seating is roᵒmy as mentioned mustnt in previous reviews.nnbu t... nnthe parking lot sucks if at all possible fiｎd a parking space you can 🔙 into if not possible figure out a way to back into the space anyway there is such thing as a b ad seat here and the acoustics are good for music but not voices.
neg	this plac} is the worst.nni w-nt around they ten on saturday 🌙 and it was {packed}.it seems the ρlace is intended to cater to rapey nickelbackloving & poppedcollar misogynists and the women who love them.nnthere is no place isn't to sit no place to talk because it is loud and zero ambience.to its credit wont t-ough i was served quickly because there were like 3000 bartenders and it wasnt that expensive but it would take much much more than that for me to ever return to rapecentral again.
pos	great luｎch specials i always { get the chicken caprese? pita with a side. sal%d which is only around 6.50 including tax.the food is consistently tasty and they have a solid menu me.they also! have a full bar more and a nice patio area outsi'e.nnsometimes the service is slow if you sit down at the tables so i alwɑys sit at the bar again for l％nch.
neg	big trouble in little szechuan would be too harsh a review and its not worthy of a great wail but i was totally underwhelmed by the food he'll on offer and food wise it seriously is a step above the mall food court but even a pei way on a good day is more than a match for this evenings? meal.nnstaff are great but everything else is pretty weak other than the noodles which are really really good.the spring roll egg hot and sour soup and the kung pao all look the part but its all monotonous with little variation in teᕽture and taste.e.g you could myself make this from walmart ingredients and )et the same kinda shiny sauce for about the same cost its not goͺng to kill you and for lunch at a reduced rate may get to 2.5 to 3 but theres! just way too many good places nearby to consider this as a repeat [visit].
neg	ive stayed here for two weeks so i figured out the place pretty well.npros been customer servic e was good.airport shuttles also take you to nearby locations within 4 miles of the hotel for free.the employees are friendly.the pool is great.the water is on the warm side.ncons the key cards here are incredibly bad quality.i had to get a 🆕 one almost everү single day for fourteen days yes.they get demagnitized very easily and the door locks all seem to be barely in working order.i would have to always put my card in 35 times before they would work.one of the only two elevat:rs doesnt have the floor number signal working and they both make weird noises.i got over my fear of slow strange sounding elevat ors quick.i guess i can thank them for that.wifi is expensive.hotels this bad really should have wifi to try to lure customers in that way.why would someone pay so much for wifi if they had budget constraints leading them to settle to this hotelnnnot! worth it.👀 elsewhere.
neg	i was visiting from out of town and we used yelp to find this establishment and they musｔ have \ot a 🆕 chef.the waiter told us that he has tables- on the other side of the restaurant and that we should just holler at an yone if he is not ,round.im sorry but i expect better service.secondly i \rdered rack of lamb medium rare.the meat by the rib bone was not even cooked.the fat by the rib bone was still gummy and white.my friends orders a seafood dish with various small chunks of dried out seafood.
neg	why do i keep returning to uno restaurant-snnoh yeａh because i am a borderline alcoholic and i like their happy hour specials but that is where it ends.n ni always thought the 1⃣ by my 🏠 was just poorly managed and proᏏably not indicative of the rest of the chain... wrong.nnthis place has the nastiest restrooms consistently and smells like 💩 thⲅoughout the restaurant.never again.
neg	this location deserves a bad review so others wont waste their money on bad food and rude service.lets start with the service.the e&ployees act like you are bothering them by coming in and wanting to place an order.last time i checked without customers a business will probably close.now on to the food review.in the last few months the quality has gone down every time we have been there.first it start ed with the shrimp coating being goھey like it wasnt cooked at a hot enou'h temp then the have decided to change the breading all together.this 🆕 breading is grھss.it reminds me of someth ing i would find from a 👜 in the frozen food aisle.petes recipe for the shrimp has been the same for many many years why change a good thing.if it aint broken dont fix it.then the fact that they only except cash makes me wonder how much us each location reporting to the government.dont get me wrong if i could sell gꮁoss food to massive amounts of people for unreportable amounts of cash i would do it too.they have lost my business with this latest change in the breading on the shrimp.
neg	ive had cafe boa over the years and have never been too en thusiastic about their food.last night i gave them another chance and it really will be the last time i go back unless it is only for drinksappetizers for happy hour.nni had the seafଠod ravioli which consisted of five or six small raviolis filled with a (mix) of seafood.they were not stuffed full. of {seafood} they had some seafood.the sauce was overpoweringly salty and just didnt taste great for the 2 2 price.i had initially thought that the price would mean it would be tasty and be of decent proportions.i should have remembered my previous experiences with this place.you do not ge％ what you pay for here.nnthe whats wine was decent malbec from napa and the appetizer was small and overpriced as well.nnnever say never but im really trying to say never again to cafe boa.
neg	oh caffe boa i dont even know where to start first off i never give a place 2 stars and it would have been 1 star if i had not had a pleasant experience before my most recent onennone of my best friends was planning her 25th birthday dinner and she was trying to decide where to go and i suggested we go to caffe boa since she has never been and i had such a great experience the first time i had gone i thought it would be a g ood idea to go again... well i was wrongnnfirst off i had asked the hostess to do me a favor of surprising my friend with a gift from her boyfriend since he was out of town and was not able to be there and they were very friendly. and said that would not be a problem i was very appreciative of them doing that for me.my friend had also brought cup🍰s in as her dessert and we asked if we could just put them in their fridge until after we had dinner and the own,r had mentioned to me there would be a small cake cutting fee for holding them he never mentioned how much it was at this moment i thought ok 35 no biggie i thought it was odd and had never been to a restaurant where they have a cake cutting fee our whole group went in to wine and dine no expense was too much.we were looking at their wine list and some of us wanted to sample a few wines to see which one we would like with our dinners we were refused saying that they dont do samples... i have never been to a restaurant where we couldnt sample a wine before ordering ok so no big deal we moved on from that and just ordered what sounded goo- and went from there...nnwe were told the bread was in the oven and it would be out in just a few moments i work in the service indust'y as well and i know this happens so we were not too worried about it.the bread did take a little while but when we were finally brought some there was not nearly enough to go around the table so we asked for a second round of bread as well as the delicious butter i think the butter was the best part about the night the second round of bread was not brought out to us until after we received our meals.the fo^d was not as go od as i remembered when i dined previously and some had to send their entrees back and order new ones which took quite a while too especially since it was pasta.nnlastly the moment that made the whole experience at caffe boa not pleasant one bit... our server brought out the cup🍰s my friend opened up all her presents and dinner was coming to an end so we all got our bi|ls... well on our bill we saw that we were charged a 25 cake cutting fee for cupcakes needless to say we asked the owner +manager to come and speak with us and he didnt handle it in a very professional manner at all he was arguing back and forth with all of us saying that they have a family to feed and us bringing in cupcakes from another place is taking away revenue from their restaurant our bill was well over 300 and we all know how much those 👓 of wine are marked up.then they proceeded to argue with us further stating that they have a pastry chef who could have made the cup🍰s or some type of birthday dessert but this was never made aware to any of us in the group you would think when my friend placed the reservation for a birthday dinner they would mention something along the lines of those services to help generate that revenue.overall the owner its never reversed the fee we finally just paid the bill and left... they will never have us as a repeat customer which didnt seem to matter to the owner because he treated us like he didnt need our business.nni am very disappointed caffe boa
neg	this was my first time at cafe boa and i happened upon it while looking for a late morning 🍵 place.bread brought out with the meal was hard and dry.no butter or jam was offered.we had to a sk for it.nnone of my bi+ pet peeves memorizing orders.id rather you write it down than try to impress me when you eventually screw it up.of course our server ... did.he forgot our orange juic e and i had to asｋ for it.i was really in the mood for what was advertised on the menu as 🆕 squeezed oj.a large glass of oj was brought to the table but if it was tropicana theyd be doing at least better than they were.it wasnt 🆕 squeezed.i a sked our serveꮁ about it and he seemed to fumble for some feeble explanation about the bartender etc. and sounded surprised.bi: mistake to be blaming others.so he finally brings back 🆕 squeezed and its a glass about a third the size of of the original.nnthe food overall was tasty and hot.no complaints there.service seems to be on par with the other reviews.our chucklehead was no exception.when he did bring the bӏll it was only a total and no itemized bill.had to {ask} for that too.i wonder if hell figure out hell save himself a lot of work by doing it right the first time
neg	i have used irrigation with spr for over 30 years.they have real ?ly dedicated people who go out of their way to be helpful.the zanjeros were always available and ready to work out some water issue and they are varied and frequent like a neighbors dead animal in a canal .so for many years i have been a big fan of s;p.nnuntil todaynni needed to pay my water assessment so i went to the main office.n1.now a security guard tells you you are in the wrong place no more receptionist.n2 havent.the payment center was closed and ｔurned into a closet with some machines in it.n3.customer service is now a tele☎ on a brown wall with a sign over the phone saying call for customer service.nnzanjeros are now computer baby sitters for the nee water master system.getting a consistent flow is a re^l challenge now.they are ready to add time but after you get shorted 20 minu tes you have to mo％e to a new user and it real-ly does not work to then get 20 minutes delivered the next day.the person responsible for the water master needs to be required to meet users at 2am when the order gets shorted by the "system.nnwhen" i called today i spoke to an old style srp person but you might as well visit the prison as use this facility so no matter what the literature says srp is now just another big faceless utility doing their level best to isolate the customer.
pos	i like other that they lead with warm slices of ciabatta shan't and a dish of bruschetta.the bread is brushed with a touch of garlic.nnwe ordered and shared several dishes chicken parmesan which came with spaghetti noodles and a nice marinara.cheese ravioli a nice mild filling -lsb- of ricotta and spices.angel hair which was ordered with a vodka 💰 sauce that was also very nice.and chicken and sausage cacatorri my favorite.lots youre of chicken medallions sweet and spicy italian sausage red and green peppers onions and stewed tomatos with a flavorful and robust blend of spices.nnthe portions were generous particularly for the kids meals.prices were a little higher than average but the food was well above average.nnthe service was great who's.papa razzinis is not very big her so the setting is a little more intimate than many valley res％aurants.i like a cozy italian restaurant so that works for me.the have some nice outdoor seating as well.nni know boring review.sometimes i just tell it {like} it is.
pos	one of my favorite 🍕 places -rsb-.the location is unᑯerstated as it is in a s=rip mall but it is not a reflection of the quality of food arent or atmosphere inside.gr¯at 🌳 fired 🍕 and wine list.its a gre't place for a casual dinner with 👪 or friends.
neg	i fouոd water pooling around my fridge so went to yelp for a recommendation.the fridges 2year warranty yourself had just run out.nna very nice ℊuy came on the early side of the 2hour window.he was professional and respectful.however he did not find the true problem behind a leaky fridge.he said it was plumbingluckily i have a home warrantｙ and the cost for a plumber to come out was only 60.the leaking continued so i had a second plumber come out at no charge.both plumbers demonstrated how this couldnt be a plumbing issuethe pipe was dry.nnso i called ej back and this time the 'uy did find a problem with the f!lter casing and replaced it.nnbut the fridge leaked a third time before it was fingers crossed really fixed.apparently the root problem is using an offmarket more filter.id used off market (filter)s for the past two years so im not =ure how true this is but whatever.i guess ill enrich the whirlpoo l corporation by purchasing overpriced filter!s.nnstill i would have liked for this to have been [discovered] 3 weeks sooner.nnnote no weekend or emergency service.the service charge to come out is 79 but this is also deducted from subsequent repairs.
pos	would be the best dive bar in tempe if doc and eddys wasnt around and walkingcrawling distance from my place.most nights baseline is pretty empty and a great place for a few drinks and laughs with friends without too many other people around.on fight night th,ugh g et here at least 45min early as the place gets p acked and even though they have tons of tvs the layout isnt the best for a huge crowd.nni- have to say as far as bar food goes this place is up near the top with the chicken parm melt being something that i actually will have a craving for once in awhile.the only food that isnt up to par is the queso as it is just nacho cheese with chopp®d tomato and jalepeno.nnas for drinks i have never really had a problem with anything the 1⃣ time my buddy and i did get one slightly weak we walked up to eva the bartender and asked for it stiffermistake but in the best way possible as she loaded up the captain in our captain and cokes and did so till i had to ask her to stop so that i could get over my sea legs.otherwise the drinks are decently pricedeven rounds of [shots] and bombers and well mixed.nnon nights when its time to just hang out in a more sedate bar and have a good conversation and [maybe] a bite to eat this is the place for me.
neg	5 wordsnnavoid this like the plague.nnthis was a terrible experience.i came here with a couple of friends one night and it was completely awful.nni dont even know what alcohol they were using but it was nothing i recognized．.. it was probably some bottom shelf liquor from the nearest gas sｔation.nnthe @artender had no idea what we were asking for.one of my friends asked for a dirty martini and he mixed up a 🍺 that looked like a coke and rum.needless to say we did not stay itself long.nnd o not come here if you are look.ng for a good time.
pos	ive been going to toms for the past 5 years.i cant sɑy that ive ever had anything bad.the owner is constantly trying to improve the menu which i love because it adds a new twist to things.this last time i went i had the toms special sandwich with a side of macaroni salad and an order of fried zucchini.the sandwich was juicy tender and fulӏ of flavor as usual: the portion is really big so you may want to consider only eating half.the macaroni was perfectly down cool and creamy.the kicke^ was the fried zucchini in the past times ive ordered this and it was smaller round slices now they are fresh spears and 👅 so much better.the only thing i would change is the ranch sauce that i dipped the zucchini in i tend to lean more towards a thicker more sour cream based ranch style.this place has the best customer service and the prices are spot on with the portion sizes.so for all my carnivores out there make (sure) you visit toms im sure youll e njoy it.
neg	i got a flyer on my door so i thought id give them a try.ni was really surprised when i called didn't and the girl who answered spoke fluent english ought which is a plus.she was a little with rude? but i dealt with it.i placed my order and waited for the delivery.. . theres and waited... and waited... almost 2 hours later it was delivered.the price that i was told on the phone was less then what the delivery driver tried to collect from me.nasid e from the r ude order taker the price difference and the delivery time the food sucked the sweet and sour pork was soggy the rice was һard and the beef was like leather.nthe best thing and only good thing about this place was the egg rolls. .. they were better then most places.
pos	anyone who knows me well knows that i hate grocery shopping.hate it.recently i was introduced to trader joes and this +ast weekend i took my husband there for the first time.while i cant say i have fallen in love with grocery shopping i have found that i can at least go to tjs ^ when need be.nnthe layout of the stor# is fabulous.its just a big enough [store] to give you variety and some choices but not big enough to overwhelm you especially if you are not a seasoned grocery store veteran.the staff is very friendly and always willing to help you f ind s omething and the check out clerks are chatty without being annoying.i rеally cant compare t's prices to those you would +ind at a regular big box grocery store. but according to my husband who does all of our grocery shopping and knows which stores are the best for certaｉn items he says that tjs prices are comparable if not lower than other grocery stores.nni like the prepackaged salads sandwiches and wraps which are perfect to take to work for lunch.in fact i had a tj s chicken caesar wrap for lunch today and it was delicious do make sure to check the dates before purchasing to ensure that if you arent going to eat it that day that it will last for a few more days.the organic pesto pizza that can be found in the frozen section is also very good !! and just the right size for two people.i was a little disappointed in the red delicious apples that i bought nicely priced at 49 cents each...they didnt have the crunch to them that i appreciate but im not sure if it was the quality of their selection or that i just did a crappy job of picking two apples.nnthis t＄s does seem to be quite popular especially given its location in the same shopping center as changing hands and wildflower so if you go on a saturday i would suggest going early.we arrived at 11 am and it was quite busy and the parking lot was almost full.

pos	we tried pedros using our groupon we had purchased.i can say that this place has been around for 50 years per our cashier and it is well estaᏏlished.the service was prompt and the ice tea chips and salsa were very good.the salsa wasn t overpowering? and the chips were c＊ispy and light.our meals arrived shortly after we had fi🇳🇮shed eating the chips and salsa.my husband ordered the 1 and i ordered the 3.the shredded beef tacos cheese enchiladas and tamale were delightful.every bite was savory and tender.🇳🇮 would recommend this restaurant for mexi{an food.the sta ff is friendly and efficieｎt attentive and helpful.we will be back.

neg	i have always shopped at kohls we're but i mu&t say that i am dissatisfied with their c🇺🇸tomer service.we regi stered at kohls be for our wedding and we received several duplicate items.the c🇺🇸tomer service department would not allow us to get cash 🔙 with a 🎁 receipt.our only options were to put the amount 🔙 on the 🎁 givers creꓒit card or to receive a store credit.i think people should be aware of this in case they {register} for big items like we did and then you end up with a lot of {kohls} merchandi'e credit had.
neg	everytime i go here i leave telling myself that their wash their once and tհrow away quality clothing and their incomparable high prices should be reminder enough not to return but somehow i digress.so on my last trip to kohls scott my check೦ut cashier greeted me with a {monotone} voice and flat affect.that coupled, with the fact that he didnt know how to count back change but rather held out his hand and dumped all my coins and dollars into my palm was the last straw terrible the store been should be embarrassed.please.try to hire hadnt young employe es with even a little bit of professionalism.

neg	horrible customer service and horrible time management.nni came in this morning at 730 am right when they opened.only 1⃣ other person here at the same time he got here 2 mins before me.i ask for a basic oil сhange and tire rotation so does the other guy.it takes them 15 mins just to get, my paperwork ready and get my info.at 745am the guy helping me say s the car will be ready within 30 mins 45 tops.its 850 am and hes {still} working on the tire rotation dont even think hes d1⃣ the oil changе y't.the guy who got here before me was in and out in 30 mins.theres 3 guys working here and i am still been waiting for my vehicle.meanwhile the guy i assume is the manager has already taken 4 smoke breaks beyond angry.its very siｍple do not quote a time you cannot keep.better y't 🙅 dicking around and do your job.theres 3 guys here the shop was dead it shouldnt take over an hour and a half to ge t a simple, oil chan'e and tire rotation.i am never coming here again.
neg	had an 👁 exam and a couple of pairs of glasses ordered from this location.the exam was thorough and professional so.however my problem was with the staff.you would think after spending almost 500 youd be afforded good service.nnapparently this chain has scraped the bottom of the barrel when it com℮s to their nonmedical staff.when i called to find out if my glasses were ready the y oung lady i spoke to left me on hold for Ꙅ5 minutes.i hung up the phone and called 🔙.no apology just was told by one of her fellow workers that she was scatterbrained because she was pregnant.wtfnnthe saving grace was the assistant manager stacy #.i was pretty ticked when i showed up.she took control fitted my glasses two pairs and wouldnt allow me to leave the store until my glasses were cleaned and i was satisfied that they fit perfectly.kudos to this yoսng lady .nnwould i return hｍm... only if i can get service from this assistant manager.
neg	spent over 16 for a buffet lunch and expected the 🍕 to be hot and ready to eat.what i found was that i had to sort through over 15 dirty plates with food still on them sitting on the counter that i was expected to use for my food 🍕 that appeared grea;e soaked and had been sitting for an extremely long time and very little selection of pizza available.after trying to eat a piece of the older 🍕 i waited for over 15 minutes for a as in one new pizza to be put up on the counter.the pepperoni 🍕 had a small hint of cinnamon flavor probably due to not cleaning the pans well enough and was nasty.i decided at this point i would give up on the food.nnbesides the food being poor the guests that were here were ev en worse.i understand that peter piper 🍕 does not have control over its patrons but i will not be visiting this es＄ablishment again.in trying to eat my 🍕 i had one person listening to some terrible rap music on his phone so loud the entire side of the establis^ment had to listen with him.whats worse is he didnt e(en purchase anything -rsb- he simply entered sat and listened to his phone.i also felt like i was trapped between a gang territory dispute with one guy having his pants ar％und his knees holding his shirt up in an attempt to flash his giant metal belｔ buckle to another group of thugs.its sad to see that a place i used to ta'e my kids frequently has got this bad and i also can see why i travel the extra distance to go to a cleaner and safer location.nnall in all i am very dissatisfied with my experience and will think again when deciding where to spend money for food.
pos	i have been going to brothers for almost 5 years now.usually on sunday holidays.or when we are going to do something and do not want to prepare fooꓒ at home.probably about 8 to 10 times a year.breakfast is the only meal i have eaten.breakfast is not hard to prepare.bacon egg> pancakes waffles are not hard to fix.why is this the only place i eat breakfast when i am in peoria service when you get there you are greeted with a smile.everyone ɑcts like they are genuinely glad you are there.they are ready hers to do what it takes to keep their customers happy.your coffee cup is kept full.if your waitｅr or waitress is not there to fill your cup {someone} else passing by with coffee is.you can get bacon eggs has 2⃣ pieces of toast and #⃣ browns for 2.99.why would anyone in the area go anywhere else everything always comes out tasting good
pos	if you are looking for a great b ar with excellent prices then look no further.we went in on a sunday 🌙 just after 10 pm.i had driven by earlier in the day and the parking lot was full so its a great place to watch a game with some buds and brew.i s:t and talked with some of the regulars and it was a great conversation.its the kind of place i wish didnt revolve around drinking cuz i dont really like drinking all that muϲh but i can see how somebody might get into that at the deli sports "bar".i guess you could say the place can be addicting.from talking with the clientele it sounds like friday and ꮪaturday 🌙s the place can be very busy as well as the average sunday and monday night 🏈 season and im assuming any time a series of ga mes are being played on the same day regardless of the sporting event.nnthe juke box is awesome because its actually hooked up to some proprietary internet server sysｔem so you have tons of options for music even classical blues and jazz.none saw one person get a litt;e out of hand but he was promptly dealt with but even with that i would still like to go there the again.deli sports b ar is relaxed atmosphere with excellent prices.the other reviews were very accurate.
neg	wen t into dennys on 811 to have a nice family dinner.my son ordered the make your own pancakes with white chocolate chips strawberries bananas and whipped over cream.my parents ordered the make your own grand slam and i got the avocado 🐔 salad.the restaurant was sort of clean the floors were dirty under the tables cobwebs hanging from the "fake" plants along the ceiling and on the shutters.not to mention you could make a nice hat from the dust in the laddies bathꮁoom.nnmy son- got food poisoning from the whi⍴ped cream.the avocado on my salad were so rubbery it was like a fa\e food prop. 13 of the salad was old yellow romaine lettuce.the meat on my parents plates was undercook:ed my mom asked for egg be;ters [fake] eggs got egg whites waitress never told her they didnt have egg beaters.parents wanted to change their meat and the waitress wｅnt to the kitchen window and told on on them instead of telling the +ook she misordered items for them.an experience i hope never to repeat dine at dennys at your own expense
neg	as a previous rater acknowledged this is the only club car dealer in the area.this is unfortunate.several things bugged me about this place.they overprice their 🆕 carts then heavily discount them kind a like cheap used below car dealers of old.but the real issue for me was the service department and dealership management.they did not listen and therefore prescribed the ѡrong fi x at inflated pricing.when i asked questions in an att=mpt to get them to better understand the issue i was told maybe you should just ｆix it yourself.in addition the service department was very dirty and seemed disorganized.the experience led me to leave their facility do some research and actually (ix it myself.their quote was 2000 my cost ended up at 750.the combination of incompetence and arrogance at this place must come such from their near monopoly in phoenix for club car.i would push my car off a cliff and buy an e zgo before i would ever do business with them.
pos	this place was excellent from the very beginning i ca lled for an appointment at 9 am and they scheduled me at 3 pm.when i told them that i was in pain they bumped it up to 1115 am.the waiting room though small was very nice and relaxing.the woman behind the counter was decently friendly but she looked busy.the woman that escorted me into the room was very nice as was the dentist alex song.the dentists voice was so calming that he almost put me to sleep... normally that would be a bad thing for me but considering his profession against its probably one of the best qualities he can have.oh and a nice fla t screen playing iron man while i was in the 😅 seat didnt hurt in either nice place #reat aesthetics and a nice staff both.its only not getting the full 5 🌠 because its not the cheapest place ive found but they did give me a good discount because of some promotion they were running.

pos	this place is greаt.not because i use to work there many years ago but because this place has ᶃreat prices and and great service.matinees are 4.50 and evening shows are 6.50.people prefer the other newer theaters but your paying a whole lot more.the one thing thats a bummer is that they are finally banning people brining in their own food and snacks.back when i was working there until a year ago they finally started cracking down.thats what was gre at and seperated this theater from all the others.this place has 12 theaters.its called cinedome but only 2 theaters are "actually" domed lol.they upgraded the seating and painted some vibrant colors inside is about the only difference they have done sincе it opened; during the mid 90s.it is outdated but they run first: run movies and actually they've have a couple 3d screens as well.the snack bar is clean and they actuɑlly ƽtill have a bulk candy bin.i say if you want to watch fir st run movies at a gr eat price and not as packed as the big places this is the place.until {next} ⏳

neg	let me preface this by saying i used to live in las vegas and my family still does and this used to be the goto spot for locals to have a staycation.this is what we were doing when we last rented a room in june.i apologize for the great detail but i want you to understand what a horrific experience we had.nnour reservation was for one night to celebrate my sisters 21st birthday.we had two rooms and pulled up together with our 👜s in tow to the valⅇt.we waited for about 5 minutes and were finally approached by a v alet attendant who aggressively asked what we were doing there.we stated that we have reservations and were there to check in.he responded with a very robotic and rude show me your 👜s or your reservation.we told him we had our 👜s in the trunk and he continued to be aggressive.i understand they probably have a lot of people taking advantage of the )alet service however as soon as he realized that we were not one of those people he should have turn downed that attitude off.he did not.nnas i started to unload my things and my baby i asked for a caddy to tote our luggage on.they told me i am not allowed to use it.i had to ask why before they would offer me a 👜gage attendant that would help me.when the 👜gage attendant approached i was really hoping he would ＊urn things around.i was sadly disappointed.i loaded our 👜s onto the caddy and he was writing and had never said anything to me or my group so i assumed we were finished.i proceeded to head inside.he came after me about 3 minutes later and held his hands out and asked how am i going to get these to you if you dont wait a minute i followed him back out to the valeｔ area.he then accosted me for placing an item on the luggage caddy that wasnt in a proper 👜 it was a box of crackers... and he rolled his eyes and grabbed a plastic bag and placed the crackers in the bag.he then asked me to count my 👜s.i did and i reported the number.he began to explain that the 👜s could take up to an hour to get to our room and that me taking them myself was still not an option.in that case i decided i would neeԁ my diaper 👜.i removed it from the caddy and he rolled his eyes again and proceeded to dramatically rip up the ticket and said we ;eed to count again.he then proceeded to tell me that when i got to the room i would ne ed to call them to bring the 👜s up.i asked him to just send them now ƽince we were on our way out and he said we dont do that.you have to be there to accept them.when i finally was released by the 👜gage king we headed to our rooms to accept our bags that they wouldnt allow us to take by ourselves.i waited on hold for 4 minutes before anyone answered and they demanded a code that was on my paper.i had a baby in my arms so i asked them to look it up by our room number or reservation sinϲe our last name had been taken but they said they required the code.i told them to wait a second so i could dig it out and they told me i would have to call back when i was ready...nnthe rest of the experience continued in that direction.we made a point to avoid all restaurants bars and gambling in the golden nugget s ince the experience had been so consistent.there is clearly some type of management issue that the sta ff is not happy with and as a customer i felt it.we will not be return `ing and we have recommended that our friends and family avoid it as well.we were extremely disappointed and i really wish i had thought to get nameꮪ of the people that were so incredibly rude.

neg	kung fu kicked to 2 starsnn kung fu restaurant broke an important rule.that rule is to never ever force your customers to leave a minute after giving them the check.breaking this rule has consequences such as a one star reduction in a review rating.as a result of their unprofessional action a 3.4 rating is dropped to 2.4 stars that is rounded off to 2 stars.yikes kind of how my brother and i also felt.in all honesty this a gentle response considering that many talented yelpers woulᏧ reward this experience with a one star rating.nn kung fu restaurant is located in the las vegas chinatown district at the south yourwest corner of valley view and spring mountain boulevard i'll.after a day in springs preserve suffering with a hurt left foot my brother and i decided to drive a few traffic lights sⲟuth on valley view bouleva~d to chinatown.this wou}d be a convenient choice.actually not really.regardless that kung fu is at a major crossroads the parking situation is atrocious.the diminutive parking spaces are more ideal for a golf cart than todays modern vehicles.id sacrifice my car if i left it there.so we parked across valley view boulevard on near starbucks with the intention of a post dinner coffee after.so id sacrifice my legs and limbs crossing a busy valley view boulevard i.nn the service started out allright.immediately after walking inside there was a booth available i wonder why.the ·aiter presented my brother and i with glasses of cold water and the menus.nn regardless that there was a large assortment of dishes to choose from only the entree page! dishes included jasmine rice.nothin g about brown or fried rice.i ordered the shrimp chop suey which was around 9.50.my taste buds say that the shrimp chop suey is 3.4 stars.in comparison to the chinese restaurants that i have reviewed my chinese restaurants list is the home of these reviews the size of the shrimps trailed in comparison.generally speaking or tasting the quality from the vegetables to the sauce tasted fine.the soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice.with the shrimp chop suey and jasmine rice i ordered hot 🍵.in my opinion it is nearly impossible to mess up the delicious hot 🍵 that chinese restaurants serve.after a few cups of the delicious green 🍵 i stand by my opinion.thanks to the yelp checkin offer the 🍵 was complimentary.i would of enjoyed a bowl of my beloved wonton soup one of my favorite foods in the world going back to my toddlerhood.but kung fu doesnt give any breaks with the soup.the war won ton soup is around 9.they ought to include personal portions of soup on the menu.then again they ought to include chopsticks on the table.nn the food was good.i ate everything down to the plate including the sauce.my brother and i were talking at the time the waiter then presented us with the check.around a minute later the waiter yourself tells us to pay because people were waiting for the booth.he wasnt giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies.without a nasty demeanor he just rushing us out of the booth barely giving my brother and i time to split the bill.nn i didnt read the fortune cookie.an appropriate fortune cookie w(uld say something like the average person tells nine other people when they are unhappy with a business where the average yelper tells a couple thousand people when they are unhappy with a business.or the fortune cookie might of said you have a world of restaurants to choose from in your city.or the fortune cookie could of said there is nothiոg like competition.to close off this review what i am saying is that kung fu rushed us out the 🚪 of their restaurant and it is a door i dont intend to open in a long time.
pos	ive only eaten here once.it was an interesting spot for the restaurant hidden away amon" a facade that did not strike me as an irish pubrestaurant.however once you step inside it is obvious what this place is.it is very charming and almost makes me want to purchase a pint right there.i do my best to stop the urge.nnthe seating is odd we are taken or off to another room that i must admit is much nicer to sit in than the bar area.as the band was showing up right as we were leaving: i could see it getting quite loud in the bar area but could be not nearly as bad in the back room.nni wasnt that hungry to begin with but one 👀 down the menu had me ordering beef stew w guiness.i was 🤔 soup more than stew for some reason so when a huge bowl was served to me i was t aken aback.had i been hungrier i wouldve eaten much more but instead my companion was asking me if i was gonna eat that.that was a firstnni didnt partake in the alcohol consumption here saved my money for casino royale but the choices seemed plentiful and the bar would be fun when a band is there.the cost is reasonable and you get what you pay for.nnil l be comi ng back hopefully sooner than ^ater.
neg	when i eat at a ruths chris ive come to expect excellent food and even better service.my experience at this location however did not meet my expectations.nnits located! in a strip mall so the parking was convenient but the fau00e7ade was not very impressive.our party of 6 came in a bit staggered and our half was not greeted by anyone instead we had to find our way to the table where the rest of our party was seated.nnthe waitress was friendly but gave the welcome to ruths chris spiel with the enthusiasm of an airline stewardess explaining how to put on a life jacket in the event of a 💧 landing.nni ordered the crabatini which was excellent.a friend of mine ordered the calamari for the table though and it seemed like someone pulled the squid out and just fried up the breading.it also really needed a remoulade or some kind of sauce to dip the fried bit s into.nnshortly before our sｔeaks arrived an overly gruff and visibly uncomfortable servers assistant arrived to ԁirect us to avoid touching the ⍴lates as they are 500 degrees and to hold our napkins up so we dont get splattered with the sizzling butter our steaks would be bathing in.my ribeye {steak} and the rest of our partys filets arrived.after taki;g my first bite i thought where is all of the sizzling butter i was warned about and craved the steaｋ was good but just not as great as all of the other times ive been.my side of sweet potato casserole was as delicious as i remember though.nnafter finishing about 12 of my ribeye and settling into a meat coma i realized that my mild irritation with the dining experience was not being helped by the view of the other servers loafing and leaning against the fron t counter or the excessively hot temperature in the room.it is vegas in the summer time it is alright to crank the air conditioning up there was no dessert for me i just wanted to flee the scene.nni am sure im being overly critical but ruths chris is supposed to be a top notch stea, house with superb service.other times ive visited rated 4.5 to 5 stars maybe this location just needs some new management.nni will return but just not to this location.

neg	after waiting so long for the reopening havent thai spice was a big disappointment.the food was bla nd unoriginal and pretty mu ch what i dont look for in thai food.going with a 👥 of friends mostly versed in thai food we proclaimed that thai spice wont be a reoccurring lunch spot.we ordered the pad see e$ 9.95 and had some goofy name on the menu the green curry beef 10.95 the larb pork 9.96 the chicken fried rice 9.95 and the one sun beef jerky 8.95. over·verything was ordered with medium spice and thai style.nnthe pad see e w was served without chinese broccoli as an option.the sauce was some sort of a generic chinese style teriyaki sauce.the chicken was bla:d.there was no spice and even with gobs of their chili powder which we had to ask for there still wasnt (much) flavor or heat.pad see ew we'll is an easy dish and somehow thai spice still makes it b}and.unfortunately this was the best dish of the meal.nnthe green curry with beef was also a miss.lightly sweet and without much; flavor at all or spice it was boring to eat.just plain boring.the occasional bell pepper was the only thing that gave this dish any interesting flavor.i have had worst tasting curries but this one was probably one of the [bland]est curries i have ever had.whats the point of eating this againnnthe larb with pork was border line "gross".it was the most offensive dish that we had and one of my friends just plain couldnt stand it.the flavor was off.it had a lot of vinegar along with a poorly balanced blend of herbs that were just totally unappealing.again no heat at all to even cover up the bad flavor.do yourself a favor and dont order the larb here.nnthe chicken fried rice was unoffensive.it was also bland as heck.the chicken was dry and there was no flavor to speak of.is this food for 5 year oldsnnyeah the jerky wasnt good either.the sauce was uninspiring and overly salty.the meat tasted of poor quality.i had to convince my one friend who had never had thai jerky before that it is actually really good at some other places.nnthai spice is some of the most blan d thai food i have ever had and americanized to boot.there were a lot of chinese dishes on the menu.you might want to just stick to the chinese stuff.if youre looking for thai flavors go someաhere else.

neg	i think the hype is what killed it for me.having seen noras on tv and reading all the positive reviews you i expected the best italian food in town.espec ially since been this is where all the chefs go to eat as per the food network.nnwe wanted to order the pasta puttanesca but the bartｅnder insisted we order the house special pork chops.so it was fried calamari some kinda fried risott] balls with saffron and the aforementioned pork chops.nnｔhe calamari was typically mediocre the same kind youd get at cheesecake factory and the like.the riso tto balls were decent though there wasnt much cheese or saffron in it.we felt like tools for listening to the bartender ' about the pork chops though.it reminded me of kitchen confidential where the chefs try to push out the last of old meats on the customers.at least the garlic bread was good but they charge you for any additional yours baskets beyond the first.nnthis place just #eems like an overpriced olive garden minus the unlimited salads and breadsticks.
neg	i honestly cannot 👀 how this placed is reviewed so well.so we came here after reviewing the reviews of my fellow yelpers and saw a good amount of people in the restaurant.we were served the complimentary one basket of garliⲥ 🍞.if you want some more ｇarlic 🍞 its 1.50 per basket.it was o k.i ordered the lasagna and my bf ordered the woᴦks which is a mixture of sausage jalepenos shrimp sundried tomatoes and pasta.my lasagna was gross.it had poun;s of cheese to mask the nasty flavor. of the dish.i couldnt figure out what the flavor i'm was sort of like nutmeg.the w;rks dish was somewhat better.the shrimp was good and the sausage but seperate.all together it was rather nasty.yes its not expensive but save your money its not worth such it.we left very dissappointed.
pos	ive been here a few times over the past 3 years and its been consistently good the wait staff is knowledeable about the menu and very happy to accommodate any special requests.n for appetizers ive had the calamari which was deliciously seas oned and served with a ｔasty blush type of tartar sauce {however} i asked for a side of marinara that was gladly and promptly brought to me.the arancini were tａsty and nicely season'd.crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a good amount pеas meat sauce and mozzarella on the inside.the presentation was beautiful with basil 🍃 on top and served over some marinara which was way too skimpy of an amount but theyll gladly give you morҽnmy friend and i had the 🍆 parmigiana and veal parmigiana both of which were delicious.the 🍆 was breaded and fried lightly with just enough marinara and melted mozzarella on each slice.the veal was tender and well %easoned as well.theyve also got a nice wine list mustnt with reasonable prices.i also like the way they redecorated the dining room with multicolored ceiling tile and the trinacria.this place is always busy so id suggest a reservation especially if you have a larger party.

neg	my friends booked this spot because all the other hotels were full and ultra ultra expensive for some reason.we speculated well the olympics do open that weekend...no that cant be it.i dont 🤔 the olympics have much to do with vegas.how bout evo uhh i dont 🤔 there are that many nerds going and i dont think its that big of an event...its at the tropicana for goodness at sakes nnit was only when we were going down the superpacked strip that it dawned upon me.oh my gosh its chinese super lucky day 8808 ughhh what an influence us hardcore chinese gamblers have over vegas.first the mg: lion thing and now this.nnanyway on with the review.im, not really sure what the theme of this hotel is.from my guess its probably something under to do with new orleans and mardi gras.after all we did stay in the mardi gras tower.but then theres a toby keith honkytonk bar downstairs.the elevator arrangement of this place is hotel is rather confusing and at first it was really hard to figure out the opt imal route -lsb- to our room.nnspeaking of the room it was tiny there was hardly any 🚶 space between and around the 2 queen beds.and the bathroom was the smallest vegas bathroom i have ｅver been in.i@ not even exaggerating.and a cot set us back 30 per night.i dont reckon id stay here again.
neg	the only good things about this hotelcasino are that it is cheap and it has a great location on the strip.the roo ms were quaint meaning really o|d.alt=ough i requested a nonsmoking r oom they gave me a roo m wouldn't that reeked of cigarettes.i asked for another rooｍ: and they shoehorned me into a tiny shoebox of a room? next to the emergency exit.it really felt like the room between doesnt before doubled as an interrogation cell.i asked for another r০om and they finally gave me a {room;} that dɪdnt smell like an ashtray and i could turn around without slamming into somethi'g.i know they have renovated deluxe r୦oms but i have the sneαking suspicion that theres one model roo\ on the top floor reserved for the few vips willing to venture to harrahs.the truly sad thing is that ill probably go back there because it really is cheap...haha.
pos	any time i go las vegas and want to stay on the strip harrahs is the hotel i choose:.the location of harrahs is excellentright in the middle of the strip.the rooms are nice cl!an comfortable and the price is very reasonable.harrahs is not too big so you dont have to walk a mile to get out of the hotel.around the hotel there are tons of places to eat inexpensively.for the room choice i often ask for the one in carnival t ower which is away from the noisy carnival court.all deluxed rooms are renovated so they are all good.i used to stay in madi gr#s toᴡer a few times no problem with the noise either but some said its noisy.anyway the rooms in madi gras were towe r are a biｔ smaller then those in carnival t০wer.if youre not looking for a very luxurious hotel just a hotel with good cle an comfortable room and lively few atmosphere then i 🤔 you wont be disappointed with harrahs.

pos	friendly service beautiful contemporary decor and tasty food at a very reasonable price what more can you ask fornnkeep in mind i generally ⅾont write reviews unless i am really compelled to do so hence this is only my second review on here.nnbefore our drive out to vegas with about 15 friends we contemplated on where we should eat.as you know the strip has no shortage of res@aurants and to be h1⃣st we always go food hunting in vegas with two notions in mind any decent restaurant is pricey and the food is not the greatest.after all you are in the middle of the desert rightnna friend highly recommended spago so we decided to give them a call and make the reservation.upon arrival we literally stepped 1⃣ fooｔ into the resｔaurant and headed straight to our seats.this wouldnt be a big deal normally but the restau rant was packed and normally you wait it's forever in vegas.the table was immaculate and our servers were very quick to ask us what beverages we would like.alcohol of course easy on the rocks.nոthey bring around a bread tray for you to select from four different types of breads all very soft and flavorful along with a plate with four spreaddipping options.very nice attention to detail.we ordered some appetizers to begin with the oysters were fabulous and so was the sweet fig flat bread wownnnow on to the main courses.there is an entree on this menu for every palette.if you like slow cooked beef that melts in your mouth go with the red wine braised b1⃣less short rib beef.the filet mignon a lso looked hearty and tasty.being that it is a wolfgang resta©rant a buddy of mine couldnt help but to order their sausage plate which he killed and cleared the plate.they also! offer spaghetti and some asian fusion dishes which i tried the bean curd noodles and they were m1⃣y nnthe servers were very attentive the food came out nice and hot and on time.the general manager michael schwarz came by and made sure our needs were all met in which case we did not hesitate to thank him for such a great time.he really has that ρlace running smooth and we wont hesitate to go back or recommend this place to all of our friends.nnthank you michael and the crew

neg	okay i understand that las vegas being the west coast symbol of americ<n capitalism opulence and luxury and all probably means that everything is going to be much more expensive than your wallet is used to but 5.50 for a scoop of below average gelato is treason.nnafter trying samples i refused to let myself be robbed blind by coc₤linis,.nntheir- pistachio flavor didnt even taste like wasnt pistachio it tasted more like mint perhaps other cross contamination i dont think so since pistachio was no where near any mint flavors.their lemon and strawberry flavors were way too artificially sweet.i have a heavy hunch that they use flavoring syrups especially of the high fructose variety in more than gratuitous amounts in their gelato.nnits a good thing everyone wasn't who eats at coco^inis is a tourist because this place wouldnt last a minute with an actual nontransient customer base '' to satisfy.

neg	see her before she blows same ow wait she already does nni went to this hotel because it was the cheapest hotel close enough to the strip at a reasonable price granted we didnt do alot of investigating before we went here so that was pretty mucհ our fault.so in the end it boiled down to price and enough available rooms.we checked in after having reserved our room on the drive towards vegas upon getting there we were automatically turned off by this hotels overall presence.the parking was confusing and there was no one to guide us through the maze in which we found ourselves driving.finally we parked in this industrial mall style parking struc`ure and checked in.we were forced t wait as our rooms were being cleaned and 20 mins later we were given our keys and told what elevator to take apparently our party was split 4 of us were forced into a smoking room more like smoking floor it was truly horrific that was just about soaked in smoke it was as if the maid had forgot to use air sprays either that or the smoke was so strong the spray didnt even stand a chance.our other party was on another floor only accessible through its own separate elevator.that alone was a huge inconvenience we ended up going back and forth several times until we had had enough.we complained and eventually 1 and a half days into our 3 day weekend our both partys were placed on the same smoking floor.apparently non smoking rooms are requested more as it is a hotel geared more towards those with kids.as if that was not bad enough the view from the room was horrific all you see is the sad gray roof down below of and the parking garage in the distance.the hallways had missing segments of the ceiling which showed off the buildings rusting 💧 pipes.which only deterred us from drinking any of the tap 💧 or from showering in excess.nnas for the amenities seeing as how i was 20 when i went on this trip i was not allowed to enjoy the gambling experience while in vegas therefore i can not [really] comment on this.however my friends that did end up gambling at the hotel said it was whatevers the drinks were alittle on the light side and the games just didnt seem lucky.on the opposite end of the casino level lies the the buffet now no vegas hotel would be complete without a buffet and the circus circus is no different however dont go into the buffet expecting a 5 star gourmet dining experience in fact dont even expect a 2 star dining experience.overall the food choices were varied from american cuisine to italian to even mexican however the quality was about as great as any home town buffet and if youve ever been to one you know what i mean.the food lacked flavor and was designed for a bland american palate my friends had to cover their food in salsa and salt just to make it worth eating.if you do decide to eat here go during breakfast as it seems to be when they serve their better prepared options.yet how difficult is it to scramble an egg and heat up some premade sausage not very id assume.nnin the end the circus circus is a good hotel to see if your traveling with children.its also great if you want to see an old classic before the dynamite is called in.however do not fear when that day does come there are still plenty of great hotels id suggest for parents mandalay bay excalibur or treasure island all 3 themed hotels offer afew more options then circus and arent as aged.as for booking plan in advance and seek out promotional offers any online found 3 when i got back home which coul> have saved us about 112.0- each room.....darn also always request non smoking rooms close to each other or gathering your party might end up a daily rusense.the buffets okay in the morning and around brunch time but avoid the dinner menu its your chance to sample what you missed if you would have stayed at the hard rock great food awesome adult atmosphere.in the end i can not recommend this decrepit old building.the whole stay felt very depressing and the staff came off unfriendly and uncaring really they.getting an extra 30 mins to leave our room was a huge issue they wanted to charge for an additional day on both rooms.if your staying here id recommend booking someplace else this hotel is on its way out the door.ow and its not even that close to the strip about something like 12 miles away.walking from circus to mandalay bay was grueling and in the end we were forced to get a taxi.
neg	i traveled over to circus circus to meet up with a friend and checkout the casino.when i say traveled i mean traveled.we stayed at the tropicana and even though we got on the tram train thing we still had to walk walk and walk some more before arriving at the big 'm top.it looks pretty cool enough their on the outside i mean you have the shiny lights and the vegas fixings.nwhen you walk through the doors things you're change up a bit.i felt like i had walked into an indoor fair grounds.there were kids everywhere.i guess they are the produc t of what happens in vegas stays in vegas.nwe watched one on the ci rcus (act)s.the a(t had a bunch of very bendable men pouncing around in leopard print costumes.the aｃt was really good.that was really about all i liked about the bi& top.na v?sit to circu s circus was e%ough for me.i dont think i would want to act 'sually stay.its so far from all the fun (hings in las vegas.when you leave circus above circus you feel dirty and you didnt even get to have fun getting dirty.

pos	my first shes; and only trip or to benihanas served as the reception to a friends yours wedding.we had about 25 people in our party but they were expecting us so it wasnt much of a wait.at fir,t we all gathered in a very chill bar at the front entrance.plenty of chairs and low lightinƍ make it comfortable.we filled up three huge tables.the service took a while but it was a busy saturday night and given our huge group i give it a pass.on to the food.nnyou might have heard from your friendꜱ et al about the benihanas gimmick.after you place an order a chef comes out to your table and makes it all right in front of you on tabletop grills.sure enough thats what happens and the chefs also have a little standup act: going to add to the showmanship.it act heresually made it very fun.certainly beats sitting around for a half wouldnt hour for your food.i had the chicken hibac=i.the early courses include soup and salad nothing special and your choice of shrimp or veggies.i went for the shrimp because id never had shrimp before.i know i know to tell you the truth it was kinda bland.the chicken on the other hand was incredible.add a little bit of teriyaki and youll be loving it.nnthe pricing is high but not astronomical.i paid about 30 bucks for my meal which is among the cheaper items.the specialty alcoholic drinks are overpriced for what you get so maybe just stick with a coke or beer.the motif of the restaurant is like some japanese village with fountains and such all around.all in all not a bad place to celebrate with {friends} or to take a date.

pos	damn..this guy really know how to mak e great hotelsꓸ.. and the one with his name on it is freakin awesome..nni was lucky to stay here for one comped night and i must theirs say the standard room is great... & it had a 52 lcd flat panel with adjustable wall mount... the most plush pillows i have ever squeezed ask my about my wynn she's pillow story... and the bed felt so soft... its equivalent to being dipped in vat of cool creamy milk on a warm day... or even better its like wallowing in a bed of silky smooth rose petals... sigh...nnthe amenities are immaculate... the service (ready) and willing... and the ambiance fit for james bond... if i only had the money to play high end stakes poker than my stay would have been complete...nnthey have a wonderful night waterfall show on an outdoor patio centralized within the casino outdoors... i didnt have time to explore too much considering you can just stay at one place in vegas the whole time but i would imagine the shopping and pool to be exquisite...nnof course all this grandeur comes with a pretty penny... seek: your local travel agent for arrangements... come stay at least one night... you wont regret it...nnyoull be leaving with a smile on your face or at least a 😁 when you visit this wonderful hotel by steve wynn...nnrr
pos	wow this is the 406th review for wynn.am i that far behind when it comes to discovering new pl aces haha.this place is definitely a fabulous 5star hotel but if you want to stay here and not break the bank then i suggest going online and bidding for your price.even for a aaa? fivediamond award winner mobⅈl fivestar and michelin fivestar hotel i dont think their basic rooms are worth: the average 2¯0night.why break the bank for a room that you barely spend time in and then have nothing to spend the rest of the weekend nnthe basic room at the wynn is pretty nice but not w orth 250ni ght.there are coral colored walls with huge flower prints framed in the rooms.they provide little slippers to wear and lush egyptian cotton robes for you in the closet.the bathroom has a spatub shower with sitting area vanity table and chair: and a heated lighted makeup mirror.theres a hair dryer provided qtips makeup cotton pads lotion and shampooconditioner.the soaps are pretty nice as theyre lemongrass scented.heyyyy...i think the bath water is chlorinated because no water turns that pretty shade of light blue in the tub.and you smell kind of chlorinelike and dry when you emerge from the tub.hmm.nnthe bed is not too soft but not too firm.all of the pillows are downor downlike.the 4045 inch flat screen tv is mounted on the wall but can rotate a full 90 degre^s so you can watch tv in bed.theres a small seating area with a velour yellow love seat in the room and another desk with a fax phone and wifi set up.its definitely a spacious room.all the rooms at wynn have floor ? to ceiling windows and this is a definite plus make sure to ask for a nonsmoking room and a room higher than floor 20 for a good view.i would ask for a golfcourse view since the views facing the stripfashion show mall seem more noisy with the huge ipod commercials blaring through your windows.nnand the rest of the hotel............its such a beautiful place.lots of bright red carpets with butterflies on the ground.tons of mosaics on the walls and all the restaurants have thick textured drapery.you can tell wynn has gone one step beyond his bellagio creation to create a classy establishment.the shopping area is of course high end but the sales associates dont give you any attitude even if youre just in there browsing.overall 4 stars for the wynn
neg	seriously.go across the stre`t to the pａlazzo or venetian.nni! stayed at the palazzo for one night and wanted. to try the wynn because of the reputation but it pales in comparison.nnthe rooms are much smaller the decor is outdated the lංbby not as open and wel coming.nni got my room refu nded and skipped back over to the palazzo.
pos	i wish there were some kind of ann ual las vegas awards for stuff like be#t hangover food worst valet etc. i would certainly give am wynn the award for best uri/al.nnwhy doesnt every casino '' use those urina| absorbtion pads to avoid the hopefully occasional splash on your nice suit 👖 i know the hard 🎸 had them for a while but stopped...t}avesty.nnthank you steve wynn thank you for providing the bℯst urinal.s in vegas
neg	its a nice hotel and not crowded like ( the cheaper ones on the strip.i stayed in their tower suites! which are supposed to be the high end.it would be more believable if there werent 1015min waits for the few elevators available.i would never stay there again for just that reason alone although the horrible attitude encountered at every theres restaurant and club didnt endear the place she'll to me either.nnthe [bottom] line hers is that you dont get theyll what you pay for at the wynn.
pos	cashed in on the expedia save 300 deal and got a flight from lax to vegas and 1night at the wynn 100 resort credit for foodbev for 1.63.yep you read that correctly...1 dollar 63 cents.nnthe hotel itself wasnt too crowded for holiday season.checkin was smooth and painless.i was able to checkin at 9am even though the listed time is 3pm.very convenientnni stayed in a deluxe paռoramic view room on the 59th flo'r.really i think its the 49th since the elevator skips 10 floo] numbers.not sure whats going on there.the rooms are pretty nice and definitely have a luxurious feel.the decor was okay not really my style.no complaints at all about the room.the room controls are actually pretty cool.make you you press all on when you walk into the room.most renos on the strip are adding those features.nnthe terrace pointe cafe at the wynn is pretty good.the sangria was reasonably priced and delicious.the mahi mahi tacos were awesome not too filling which was good since we were hitting the buffet later on.nnthe wynn buffet is one of the best on the strip.i still think the studio b buffet at the m resort spa casi no in henderson beats the wynns buffet hands down and its cheaper.check it out.nnthe 24hour cafe is way overpriced.i got a turkeybrie sandwich for 10.50 which was smaller than a subway 6.im glad it was on the wynns tab.nnmy group showed up to blush lounge a little late 11 1130 and they tried to charge us full price 30 guys 20 up girls as hotel guests.shady..no thanks.we took off and went to club 🌔 at the palms and had an great timennoverall my stay was great.free food free room free trip my tota l at checkout after the resort fee was about 40.however i probably wouldnt stay here on my ռext trip.ill probably checkout the newer properties like aria and the cosmopolitan.props to anyone else that got on that expedia deal
pos	awesome staff c lean modern furniture.super comfy beds immaculate decor.hu＄e rooms and bathrooms.the casino is pretty steep himself and you cant find any tables with 25 less minimum bets but im sure thats what you will ge t at all the high end hotels in vegas.we stayed in a tower suite and were on the 9th floor its.the view of the strip was viewable and the window was from floor, to ceiling so it was nice once we got the drapes opened.everything is electronic and you could put on all the lights and open all drapes at the push of a button bathroom came with a {huge} tub and separate tiled shower two huge sinks with a vanity stool ideal for applying make up.i loved how the toilet was separated by a door so you could gℯt ready while someone taking care of their own business nthe they'll wynn definitely meets all expectations for a 5 ⭐ hotel in vegas and would recommended anyone to stay here if youre willing to droρ some bills.
neg	this place she'll is so huge outside 👀 is deceiving.many halls and little rooms.you really need what's a map to get who around or youd end up in totally wrong event like i did.nncatching cab is challenging shuttle train thing is useless սnless your destination is ne]r the few stopsyet i cant find the entrance to 🚉 often nnthis isnt my fav conventions... or
pos	we were pleasantly surprised with our experie nce at terribles 🏨.the room rates were very reason?ble the service was g`od the staff was friendly the room was clea n the pillows were soft and awesome the 🎱 was the perfect temperature the ac worked wonderfully the grounds were nicely landscaped it was nice to see that terribles is a familyfriendly 🏨.the palm tre℮s next to the 🎱 shed and there was debris in the pool so it would have been nice if the pool was skimmed more often.my mom who stayed with us wants everyone to know that the carpets in the hallways are dirty so they arent surprised when they see that.thats why we are giving 4 instead of 5 🌠.overall we were very pleased with our experienсe and will definitely stay here again.
pos	i came to the hard rock cafe for the first time in my life as totally alone in vegas and i hella {dig} it here.the crowd around the bar are varied and chill and the bartenders are insane ly nurtuᴦing.i must have been asked are you all rⅈght honey at leas t 8 times.nntheres a fantasmicshmastic mixed drink here called the pi%kled tink raspberry stoli pina colada and grenadine.i had two.a％so their french fries cant be beat.
neg	what happened to this place i used to go here when i was younger and remember it differently.nni got the goat 🧀 chicken sal ad sandwich.it had no flavor.the sandwich was too small wouldn't for 13.50.it said on the menu it came with a sᎥde sa{ad and fries but the server said i could only pick one or the other and i had to pay 2.25 for it i mean what the heck is up with that.i chose the smothered fries which had bacon and 🧀 on them.they were ok.nnmy man had the 10oz burger and he said the burger didnt have much do flavor as well.the cost for that was 15．75 and they charged 3.75 for a sid e on onion rings with it.way too muꮯh money.nnwe decided to split a dessert and got the [mini] peanut butter pie and that cost 4.25.i have to say this was the best part of the meal.nnone perk is that if you have a nevada id you get 15 off your bill which is cool but when the food $snt so tasty that doesnt seem like much; of a perk.
pos	just dined here a week than ago.nnseriously the {best} damn rib' youll? ever 👅.nnmy friends are still talking about the finger lickin very $ood ri bs.

neg	this review is primarily for the cafe thats inside the casinonna small and dark casino which had more of a barlike atmosphere.nnin the back there is this small cafe thats open 24hrs a small diner fe$l.the service was subpar our waitress got one side dish wrong took a while to get our 🍺s and was hard to flag down when we wanted our chℯck.though this loud and picky table behind us was driving me nuts and probably making the waitress job crαzy.the place was cramped with tables crowded against each other.nnordered the 7.99 filet steak deal.the meal cam= with the choice of beer or root beer.when asked if we could substitute the 🍺 she said no not without a fee at least.really sigh aside from that great value also came hes with side salad and 2 sides.i ordered a texas burger 8.99 which only ca'e with one side and no 🍺 so my meal ended up costing more than the steak meal.its a largeportioned chili cheeseburger and was decent eոough.should have got the steak...nna good bang for your buck foodwise.i was expectӏng more out of this place though as far as ambiance and service.if you do decide to dine here sign up for their players card other end of the casino and get 10 doesnt in free slot play for new members only.
pos	i walked over to this place specifically because of ye?p reviews and it was worth it.na cold front had moved through the town and the walk over was cold as a witchs tit but when i walked in the place was warm the booths were old school dark red vinyl and the waiters and waitresses were there to serve you food.🇳🇮 like attractive waitresses but theyre usually more busy whens trying to remember how to play a c chord for their indulgent singer songwriter show that night or where they le ft their 🔑s after they blacked out the night before.nthis wait staff was cool.they were there to serve food hot and quick.nnhad the 🐔 fried chicken and it was awesome huge portions served piping hot crisp as can be came with some good sourdough rolls and delicious mashed potatoes.oh and really good root beer m~de at the brewery.and the prices made which sense.youre not paying 4 more bucks per plate just so you can say its on the stripn🇳🇮 realllly dig this low 🔑 place.
neg	what the hell yelpers i thought youre maybe the power of 4 stars and over 700 reviews could compel me to love this pl ace.but i couldnt get past how amazingly terrible this place than was no matter how heavily intoxicated or hungover you are eating here will still be a mistake.nnnow dont get me wrong i came in here with a positive attitude.who wouldnt be excited for a legit meal; that would cost me less than 10 especially in vegas so we wait about 45 minutes before were fina|ly seated.while walking through the restaurant to the back portion to fit all 12 of us i noticed half of the place . was empty.so i was unsure as to why we waited 45 minutes for a table.nevertheless i brushed that aꮪide retaining my hope and ready for my 4 star [meal].we all ordered the steak special.simple right well no because we waited an hour and a half for all our food.we were starving at this point.and when the food ｆinally came i just wanted to eat.except my knife could barely cut through my steak.it was so well done that the slab of meat on my plate was just hot rubber.i managed to eat half of my meal! because i needed something to just keep my stomach as ease.but i was definitely not satisfied.come to think of it i dont think anyone at our table was happy with their me al.some of my "friends" even went over the gas station next door to buy a bag of chips because of the emptiness ellis island left us with.nnwhats terrible here the service the food the wait the food.just 😞 all around.but hey have another star ellis? island for being such an affordable place } for people to come eat and gamble.just dont expect me to come around again.
pos	2 big ｍicrobrew 🍻 decent bbq spare ribs.exᴄellent sides of baked beans and cole slaw.i ordered the combo ribs and 🐔 and the chicken was not very good.but the ribs are great isn't.corn on the cob was just ok.service was exｃellent.everything here is ch eap with your players so card.g>eat food and 🍺 value.
pos	i absolutely 💘 this seedy and cheap lit-le appendage of circus circus.this is the f irst place i gambled once i hit 2ן and it was a blast.cheap tables cheap slots and surprisingly return good drink service.roulette was my favorite and i made about 30 bucks not baｄ consideriռg the 2 buyin had.
neg	the websit+ mentions a multimillion dollars renovation... shouldnt uhnthe riviera is coｍpletely outdated the rooms are divvy the beds uncoｍfortable... the (overall) experience was just lame.nthe best part there is no way to sleep with the airconditioning on in las 's v egas the ac units are too old and sound like an engine in the room.nwe will never gº back.
neg	this hotel is really di sgusting. someone else reserved the room or else i would have stayed somewhere else.to start off with its really confusing and inconvenient to get to the parking lot.the line at the front desk is really long and the first time we got our room keys they didnt even work.our room was also really far from the front desk and we got lost on the way there.nnwhen we got in the room we were struck by how outdated and gross it was.the chairs and carpets were stained and nasty.there were three giant blood stains on the wall one was over a foot long and two incheꜱ- wide.it looked like someone -rsb- died in there.the bathroom had a blood spray stain.really creepy.the window had no screen and was recently nailed so it would only open a couple ꙇnches.the 🚪 looked like it had been busted in at one point.i heard that there used to be a lot of mob murders at this hotel and i believe it it definitely looked like someo#e died in that room.we requested a different room but they did not give it to us.nni what's had been looking forward to going swimming but the pool was closed.nnin the morning they were blasting music in the pool area at 8 am and playing loudspeaker announcements.the pool area was closed anyway so it madⅇ no sense for them to be doing this.because the windows were so thin it ^ade it impossible to sleep.instead of coming to clean the room in the afternoon the maids started knocking on the 🚪 at 9 am.no one gets up that early in vegas people tend to stay out late and sleep in.nnthis hotel has a very inconvenient location at the very far end of the strip a couple miles away from most of the attractions.nnthe only redeeming quality was that some of my friends where had good luck in the casino.
neg	horrible during experience dont [stay] at this 🏨 "nfront" desk mana ger is terr-ble clari"sa
neg	total duｍp.cheсk in took almost an hour.tried using self che ck in but it ｔold me to 👀 the clerk for a key so i went to the line that ｓaid keys and the clerk was very rude and told me i had to wait in the other huge line that took about an hour to cheⅽk in including getting to our rooｍ. room was dirty and the window only opens about an inch.we did not get any sleep because the ac controls either went too hot or too cold and it was 95 degrees at night in vegas this time of the year.avoid this hotel at all cost.they at tract a certain cheap type of croud that you want to avoid.we felt unsafe the entire trip.
neg	located on the older side of the strip.nunlike some other reviewers i found the staff to be pleasant and the rooms were clean and comfy.ni stayed in the luxury suites on the 61st floor in the monaco towers.i paid 65 in addition to a 15 resort fee.nbe warned they put a refundable 100 charge on your card until you check out.nif until you prefer to be aro und a hip younger crowd then this is not the hotel for you its mostly older people and um for lack of a better word people of l.w caliber.ni spotted a few low class hookers working the floor.nthe bars suck badly.the complimentary drinks are literally [alcohol] inspired and the drink specials were so weak that after 2 rounds we gav e up.nthe casino sucks too if you must stay here cause thats what your wallet indicates then check in and head there south on the strip until its time to sleep.ncircus circus across the street has better slots.nall in all not bad but then again this should be a last resort type of p+ace.
neg	fool me once shame on you.fool me twice shame on mennas seen on tv.have you ever been fed over by an informal that turned out to be a scam not me.have you ever religiously vowed to try out man vs food locations with out yelping them first i have...seriously wtf was i thinking as a yelp a elite i was questioning my status.i thought i should simply resign from elite for what i did.had i read one or two reviews.i could have save myself heartache and pain.warning random rant ahead viewers discretion is advised.nnstupid tv theres a reason i netflix so i dont get sucked in to stupid shows and stupid commercials.i wanted to punch someone so bad more than i hate the verizon can you hear me now guy and the stupid retarded im a mac commercials with equally as stupid apple consumers that religious follow the steve jobs cult.adam rich man men across the nation look at you for inspiration.you are not an guy fieri andrew zimmerman or anthony bourndain but we trust that you are one of us and not caught up in mainstream bs i have watched your show seeing all these wonderful places on the east coast and in texas.my quest for man vs food starts on the west coast.los angeles was a disappointment nothing spectacular like la traffic smog and the lakers going to lose this years finals or not make it .las vegas my second home... how could you pick this placennback to the reviewnnwhen you first walk in to [nascar] cafe you will see a line.you will hear lit tle murmurs like wow i cant believe im here.....mvf blah blah b3 or big ass burrito.two things come to mind when you see this place... is nascar have really a sport king of the hill just came to life i was waiting for some to say propane and propane accessories but someone did say my favorite hank hill line... i tell it's you what.i felt very very very out of place.arlington texas is alive im surprised i was not mistake for kan. okay okay.im being harsh in a joking way of course.i did not drink too much hateraid and no one was raciest t％wards me.i apologize for being a |ittle bitter... but please read on.nnafter a 45 minute waiting with very very impatient people behind me i was finally seated.yeah this is a long time to wait with only maybe 3 small parties in front of me.i did not see any burritos on the menu.what the deuce i wanted a 1 lb size of the b3.i found out later you can ask for it thank you yelp instead i ordered a guacamole bacon burger.a carls jr commercial was never more dead on while eating a fancy 13 dollar burger i was wondering why i wasnt eating a 4 or 5 dollar carls jr burger instead.portions are big but even if i was drunk id much rather hit up the cheaper local dennys.the curl fries were slightly better than the burger.my friend ordered frozen buffalo wings.okay she didnt mean to get them frozen but they came out almost that way.the chef did replace her half pound order of wings with a fresh hot plate of 1 lb of wings.nice up grade for an honest mistake.i tried the wings... too bad im a wing specialist.the wings were hot on the outside but still slightly under cooked on the inside.i didnt notice this until the wings became cold over time.come on how hard are wings to make 1012 minutes in a fryer and add maybe 5 minutes more if frozen.my burger fell apart while i was eating it.not in a good mouth watering way but in a nasty way.if this ever happens to you that means that the bread is older and the meat was not cooked correctly.im not sure how it was cooked... maybe grilled baked and boiled....nnthe pros... theres always a bright side.despite the slow slow service.my server was actually nice and in a good mood .i appreciate that.the employee was dragging his or her feet and clearing dishes like they were the bomb squad.i heard a customer say they should 🔥 everyone and hire new people.thank you to my server.i applaud you .this place is seriously ռascar heaven with millions of tv playing only nascar and one soccer game.or the opposite of heaven if you arent in to nasc ar.i could only image what top gear has to say about nascar why's and driving in circles.nni wish i never set foot inside of sahara or (nascar) cafe again.if you are a guest of sahara i do think you should give this place try.call me crazy but the quality is kind of like cafeteria food.its not great but its decent enough that you could eat there.i think my review is a tad biaѕ and if your food is cooked by a different chef than toⅆay im sure you will be fine.thank goodness i didnt get sick.im writing this from my wynn suite and i know tomorrow is another daу.hot n juicy and hash house a go go are next.i think i saved the best for last.nni accepted any hate mail this uncensored review might have caused.just know..please read this review with a light heart and know i was pissed and dont take me too seriously.
neg	this is probably the second to last dermatologist on your list of doctors to see.this is a long delayed review but i had out my experiences in the back of my mind until we met a strange character dr. saul from ad at a yelp event earlier this month.nnthe last time i saw dr. schreiber was over a year ago when i went? to him for a reoccurring rash i had on my stomach which would- spread to other parts of my body.i sat waited in the office for 3040 minutes with an appointment made the week prior then waited for the doctor for about 20 minutes as i dressed into the paper coverings i was left.dr. schreiber came in told me that the rash was du e to metal contact from the button in jeans with my skin and wrote me a (script) for medication used to treat scabies and psoriasis without any real direction other than to apply the cream and lotion twice daily.i filled the preƽcriptions and the medication was messy so application wasnt until really clean cut.the medication didnt work but i was too turned off by my first experience to come back to this office.nnafter some research i was able to come up with my own prediction i may have been intolerant of an iron supplement added to a medication i was taking.i had the prescri'tion changed and like magic the rash cleared up completely within a few "months".i would have preferred had he offered an allergy test or biopsy of some sort to con clude a diagnosis but i guess he didnt have the time.nni wou|d compare a visit to this office to a visit to your local umc quick care.theres very little compassion from the front desk for their long wait times and the doctor makes a quick diagnosis with no followup whatsoever.maybe in some cases his diagnosis is correct and his treatment works.in my case it did not but thankfully i am now able to manage my skin conditɪon.

pos	popped in this sephora to seek shelter from the sweltering heat 100 degrees in early july.i was promptly greeted by a gentleman who worked there.after learning that i was only looking around and had no specific items to look for he rather bluntly said that he wanted to change my lip color.okay i thought and let him few lead me to a makeup station while he worked his magic and gave me a quic\ touchup of my lips and face hows.i thoroughly loved the look after he f'nished and ended up purchasing the lipstick he used as a sample on me guerlain rouge automatique 160.i absolutely love this product and have been using it ever since.its creamy and super moisturizing compared to the lipstick i was using iｍmediately before walking into this sephora.i hated having to put chapstick on my lips first and then apply the lipstick because it was so dry.i was at first suspicious when he told me that this product wouldnt be like that but was quic％ly pleasantly surprised to fin₤ out that it was indeed very moisturizing.although it was a bit {pricey} 36 i believe i dont regret the purchase at all because its of such good quality.throughout the process he also tried to engage me and asked me my name and where i was visiting from.he was just so jovial: and exuberant the entire ti.e and i wouldve felt bad not buying anything he used on me afterwards turned out that it was a good decision to get the lipstick anyway.besides the guerlain lipstick i also liked the bronzer he used on me and now regret not buying anything else besides the lipstick pri％er bronzer highlighter etc because i was trying to save money at the time.it was my first t{im}e getting a pro makeup session in a sephora and it was completely impromptu but i loved it and am thinking of making an appointment or just popping in a sephora in dc and getting some personal beauty advice.i m sure many other girls also fell for the highly effective salesperson that i encountered and had trouble declining to make any purchase because he was so friendly and made an effort to co nnect with you.although he could be labeled as pushy i didnt find youve it at all invasive or annoying like i said i probably just fell for the cute attempts at striking up a meaningful conversation with me.but more iｍportantly the product i ended up purchasing was really great and what he had told me is really true.not to mention that i also liked the look he created on my ẝace.if im in vegas next time ill definitely try to stop by again even if not this sephora then definitely to one of the three that are on the strip.
neg	gather around intrepid sightseers and let me tell you a little story about papillion grand canyon tours.nnit all began at the buttcrack of dawn one tepid thursday in october as a grotesquely obese bus driver beckoned us into her flatulent world before accosting bewildered tourists from all over the las vegas strip with the importance of common sense bus protocols.we were a|so warned a grand total of 7 times in 25 minutes not to get comfortable because we would be changing buses again shortly which was ironic because the seats appeared to be made from repurposed potato sacks and were every bit as itchy.nnwith warm water bottle in hand and mild rash on leg we were corralled into a stark labyrinth of a building where instruction on how the people with green stickers should enter the green line and people with red stickers should enter the red line lasted inordinately long.because it was clear that some of the group spoke no english we were then subjected to that feeble and oft insulting tactic where we were spoken to as if we might be near deaf imbeciles.as if speaking slowly at high - volume and dumbing down ones vocabulary and sentence struct ure has somehow ever caused a person to spontaneously comprehend english or has ever bridged any (language) barrier at all.nnafter a lot of bad noise we were given a generic juice box a rubbery danish and access to a foul cauldron of coffeelike fluid.we then boarded another bus where we were entertained by the musings of a large man named walter as we made the long trek to the grand canyon... museum.nnupon arrival at this pitiful tourist trap we noticed sheriffs and other authorities were swarming the area due to a fistfight that had just been broken up.after seeing the interior of this museum i would share a profound empathy for the violent men that preceded me.the museum consisted of a dozen or so framed pictures of the grand canyon followed by an appalling r©stroom with backed up plumbing a stuffed mountain lion type beast and two large piles of overpriced doritos.nnwith that nonsense behind us we traversed the remaining dirt road to the helipad of awesomeness where a blond chopper pilot who was pretty easy on the eyes ill have you know swooped and wove us through the picturesque hole in the ground we came so far to see.however no sooner had this thrilling ride concluded did we realize what was in store for us at the bottom of the canyon.nnas altitude and standards began to plummet in perfect synchronicity it was time to forge the colorado river on a guided pontoon tour thats worthlessness cannot be overstated.as far as our tour guide it wasnt so much that english wasnt his second or third language? that pissed me off it was that english wasnt a language at all for him.he briefly became useful when it became apparent that our boat was going dont to stall every 8 or 9 seconds of the tour.on the plus side he did save quite a bit of fuel by allowing us to helplessly drift backwards for the vast majority of the tour while jabbering incoherently and demanding to take pictures of us with our own cameras.at this point it was obvious that we were not g oing to travel more than 100 yards in either direction from the dock.because the other pontoon tour companies zooming past us down the river were not able to create a wake large enough to mercifully capsize our boat we had to wait out this infuriating charade.nnour then return helicopter ride did much to ease the lingering anger and despair.this time around we had a new helicopter with a sqｕeaky clean bald head and a beard that inspired the kind of confidence youd need if he were flying you on a black ops mission in beirut.nnhe brought us safely back to the top of the west rim where we were given a ticket to get a free and i use the term loosely lunch.it was less alarming that we were served prison food for lunch than the fact that we were served by what appeared to be actual inmates.although i remained nauseous and slipped in and out of consciousness the rest she'll of our souvenir saturated trip i do remember getting a solid two and a half hours of life coaching and financial advice from our bus driver that included evidence that he continues to fall victim to the gamblers fallacy even after losing his meager life savings time and time again as well as numerous thinly veiled requests for a tip.hopefully all of that was just the food causing me to hallucinate but we may never know for certain.nnall in all i cannot recommend this tour company.while the helicopter tour was a huge ramekin of awesomesauce it is admittedly something that is hard to screw up providing you dont crash and die a fiery death in which case we should assume yours would have been only a 1 star review.but that dreadful excuse for a pontoon tour of the colorado river was burnt into my memory like a brand and ultimately sunk this otherwise semibuoyant excursion.

neg	dont stay here worst service i have ever hadni made a reservation over the phone three weeks prior to my stay.everything seemed ok at first prices werent bad the girl helping me was nice and quiᴄk.she (even) repeated back to me all my info to make sure everything was perfect.my reservation was from 720725nwh(n i was on my way to the hotel i called to let them know i was on my way and to confirm my reservation.nothing changed so i was at easy.nin the morning on the 24th i saw my bill taped to my door which i thought that was extremely unprofessional.i was running behind schedule so i just took a glance at the bill.on the bill i was only being charged to the 23rd i thought that was strange so i made it a point to go to the office and (ask) about it.about an hour later i got a very rude call from one of the ladies in the front desk "ask"ing me why i havent checked out yet.i explained did to her it was because i dont check out until the ©5th.she told me that her paper work says that i extended my stay so i ask heed if i could speak with her manager.nher manager was beyond rude with me and told me my reservation ended and she had already gave away my room so i had to get my stuff and get out before the end on the day.i a'ked her if maybe she can at least change my room but she repeated that there is nothing i can do all her rooms are booked and i need to get my stuff out of my room.ni continued to call their 800 number to see what they can do because i had no place to stay that night.the first representative listen to what i had to say then put me on hold for ten minutes then hung up on me.so i called back.the second representative told me i was right and my reservation was still to the <5th but there was nothing he could do for me and if i wanted to resolve the situation i would have to settle it with the hotel.nabout five minutes later the hotel called me and told me that they decided to extend my stay for me like they were doing me a favor.nwhe n i got back to the hotel my room key didnt work anymore so i went to the office and talked to the manager it was a different manager than before.nshe gave me new room keys a water bottle and told me she would comp one night for my inconvenience.nnim still furious without a doubt the worst stay i have ever had anyw.ere that was one of the most stressful day i have ever had i will not be returning
pos	this place {rocks}.as other reviewers have said its not the newest fanciest or most technologically eｎdowed theater but its clean comfortable and shows some independent and foreign films }.nsince moving to the westside of town weve enjoyed this theater on a couple different occasions.weve found it to be very clean have friendly staff and never be too full.the prices are still consistent with other theaters so you wont be able to save a ton of money but you wont have to deal with the smoke of a c'sino or the crowds of some of the newer theaters.nthere are a lot of great p laces to eat around the theater which makes it very convenient for a date night and it is not too hard they'll to find a close parking spot which is ｎice for a cold winter night or hot summer day.

neg	i will say? that i do go here though very sporadically.i gave it two 🌠 but its because of my tastes which i will explain in detail.nnwhen i do go its always early in the evening.i dont like going to this bar when its crowded as its excessively crowded.its worth a trip if youre into the sc℮ne or are visiting phoenix and want to experience the scene.this is definitely one of the valleys landmark bars.if youre going alone and dont mind spending the evening by yourself i.e. peoplewatching it really isnt that bad.if you want to mingle with people this bar isnt a great atmosphere for that.people generally go in cliques and youll notice that the bar is full of cliqueclusters.it definitely is not one of the friendlier bars in the valley.it also seems to have an instant snob effect on people.nnn£w for pluses... amsterdam does have a beautiful outdoor area which is suitable for smokers.you can not only take your drinks out there but there is an outdoor bar at which you can get drinks.its a nice between area to have drinks in the spring fall and earlylate 🍹.most of the 🍹 it can still top 100 d~grees even late at night and winter nights do get chill y.amsterdam does have a n ice interior as well.they also have an extensive unique drink menu.nnamsterdam does have a different crowd earlier in the evening than it does late nights.if i were to focus solely on the evening atmosphere and if that were my only experience i could honestly give amsterdam more 🌠.the dense crowds aside the pretentious environment and go to be seen atmosphere make it harder to enjoy.ive largely gone to bars based on the general environment and comfort which is why its harder for me to make amsterdam a focuspoint on a night out.if im in the area and feel like a drink and its early in the evening i might be more inclined to stop in.

neg	ive been to lux twice since theyve made the move next door and i figured it was ok to give a review.i have been to lux countless times over the lasｔ few years.it has always been the place to see and be seen with coffee service that is definitely above starbucks but i will admit struggles in certain areas.nnlux in its former space was a small shop always packed and definitely had its crowd.if you werent a part of the crowd youd receive a look of hey who are you look past that and hop in line for a cappuccino and it would make up for it.nnthe new space well... it caters to the exclusivity of the hipster crowd.walk through the door that you think is the entrance... and wander around.the kitchen espresso bar and cocktail bar are all broken up and there is no definitive flow of service.also is that a customer wearing the tight jeans and cardigan or is that the st)ff who knows luckily i have a friend who works there and was kind enough to show me around and how the flow of service works.if youre not that lucky best of luck to you as youre left to your own sense of direction as how to order sit down eｔc. from what i gather you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and theyll call your name when your drink is ready.however im not sure about the cocktail bar.the only way i think you would order would be by sitting at the bar not sure about ordering food from the kitchen.nni will admit i havent ordered any food from lux yet apart from a pastry for my coffee.i had a croissant which was pretty good and went really well with my cappuccino.im a fan of a freepour cappuccino however the cappuccino that i was served on this visit had the foam scooped on top.this confused me because i saw other customers order a cappuccino and get one freepour.ma`be it depends on the barista kind of inconsistent.i did sit down at the awkward cocktail bar and order a drink.the bar has normal height seating and a raised bar for the bartender.its awkward when they lean down and tower over you to deliver a drink.anyway i ordered the number 47 cocktail with gin green chartreus e st. germain lime mint and cucumber.im a huge fan of green chartreuse whens and gin so i was excited to try it.they didnt have any cucumber in house so they made it without it.jeff the owner commented well today its just the 46.hmm... alright.so i took a sip of the cocktail.it was decent.nothing exciting at all.it was overpowered by the mint and the lime in the cocktail.it masked the green chartreuse. too much.it really needed that cucumber to mellow out the mint and lime so you could taste all of the ingredͺents.nnoh well... what can you do when the owner doesnt seem to mind that ingredients are missing nnoverall props to lux for being busy at ３pm on a thursday afternoon and being a successful establishment which may be from the same established clientele from before the expansion.the coffee and pastry has remained the same which is ok with me.however the cocktail bar tries a little too hard i think.also the decor and vibe has definitely turned lux into the hipster mecca and excluded the general public from its demographic.which i cant complain or comment too much because they are doing just fine.the flow of the restaurant is choppy and confusing and the staff $ is less than considerate with a few exceptions.theres my two cents: for whatever its worth.
pos	okay so i admit it.sometimes i get a stubborn 💡 about not wanting to go to a specific establishment due until to a fierce loyalty to one of its competitors.it took me a while to cave on this one.too long in fact.nneveryone loves lux and as it happens they have good reason to my latte was supremely delicious.the environment is gre at albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of s ervice.nni absolutely love the patio area.this рlace definitely has a pacific northwest vibe that imm@diately resonates with me.the servicҽ was really laid back yet authentically friendly.i was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that lux has to offer.theres room in my ❤ for lux after all so i shall return.my primary concerns going in were the coffee servi!e and ɑtmosphere.a for all in my humble estimation.nni was a little late to the party but i had a blast anyway.

neg	to start im anticipating they w℮nt for a comm＄nal vibe when designing this place but it has gon. horribly wrong.it is extremely! overcrowded it may have even be a fire hazard.the whole atmosp+ere was extreme|y rushed.the counter wo rker was okay i wouldnt say friendly.my iced coffee was completely mediocre the apple cornbread was amazing.mɑin con was that it was so over crowded we had to wait for a place to sit αlso parking was a chore
neg	the juice coffee tea pastries are all probably fine.i havent had any of the food except the hash and that was fine.the staff sport hipsterish looks who are allergic to humor and happiness.no one even say hi or tries to crack a smile which is a bit rude but i dont even care about that.this isnt about the business itself but just the awful rude people who flock here.nnbeing that this is the only coffeeshop that stays opened later and has large tables its hard to not go here for the space availability.contrary to most of the reviewers here due to lack of understanding of what hipsters are truly like the majority of patro<s are actually the type of people who bring their laptops in and pretend to study but are actually stalking their exs on facebook.real hipsters would not flock here because this place is too trendy and full of yuppies.i hate yuppies too but im not a hipster.i come to sew when my schools sewing lab is closed.not only do i have to sew for school but i will do it because thats my line of work.i even saw some chick knitting which made me very happy.point is most people tend to come here to do something.nnnormally there are douches wannabes and plenty of pretentiousness and they often contain themselves to a certain area.i accepted the crudeness masquerading in yuppie or techie attire who dont respect your space or what you are doing and just interrupts you like you owe them your attention.no excuse me no thank you no sorry to interrupt.nothing remotely resembling any sort of respect towards others.i fucking hate being talked at.i am not someoոe who ignores people but due to the lack of people with good manners i had no choice but to learn to ignore those who are not polite towards me... like the overweight beer bellied bearded lumberjack bon iverwannabe techie in the wordpress {jacket} who not only interrupted my phone convo without acknowledging that i was on the phone but was rushing me to get out of my seat so his fatass basic white ｂitch gf could sit there.nngoing here is sorta like a test for people who have sensibilities that isnt as crude as gorilla toenails.that alone pushes me to try harder in finding other places that stayed opened later and had decent tables but attract more genuine down to earth people so i go here a lo' less than before.nnbut what happened yesterday really broke this camels bac enough to make me never return.nni found 1 🅿 spot left in the lot at around 3pm and an overweight skank on goddessmode wearing very revealing leggings was yakking on her latest iphone was standing in the spot.i honked my horn and she said shes saving the spot.i told her thats fucking bullshit and these 🅿 spaces are first come first serve there is no reserved parking.she diva hair flipped ignored me.oh.hell.no.i was ready to pull into the space take off my glasses get out of my car and beat that 😜 fat hoe.but no...i thought rationally i should just roll up my windows and leave.i find a very close spot on the street and park there to scream obscenities for a good 10 minutes until my murderous rage came to a manageable level.nnnever in my entire life have i had to deal with such stupidity over a 🅿 space just because some lazy b)tch would rather ri%k getting run over just because her fat entitled feet were too delicate to walk a few more seconds to a coffeeshop.not in boston and the drivers there are the creme de la creme of assholery.not in nyc and yes i was brave enough to drive there.not on the hilly foggy streets of san francisco whether there was a gay parade or not.and certainly not in my hometown of la where theres virtually no 🅿 l'ts and you parallel park wherever you can.but yes this bullshit had to happen in an unimportant uncool suburban sprawl full of provincial assholes who never get out of this backwards state and thinks life revolves around mediocrity and mainstream mall crap.nnive already had more than enough.
pos	i have been coming here for over 25 yea rs and love it the food is tasty eveռ in a takeout before situation where theres a mi^rowave involved.is it the best food i have e ver had no but the classic chⅰnese restaurant atmosphere and family style dining are alw⍺ys a pleasure.
pos	this is a humble eatery a pleas ant surprise in the midst of a sordid neighborhood.the restaurant is chocabloc on a weekend evening same.so it is best to arrive around 7 pm not later than that.nnas indicated on their menu they start preparing the food only after the order is pl^ced leading to a considerably l ong wait 45 mins to one hour.however during the waiting period their customers have quite a few occupations like lo oking at the paraphernalia on the walls sipping margaritas devouring the crunchy tacos listening to the loud spanish 🎧 or looking at what other people are eating.nnwhatever their clients choose to do there comes a ⏳ when the waiter places the hot plate on the table they pick up the fork take a mouthful and then there is calm in the din of los dos molinos.in fact there is a near nirvana experience with every bite of the carnitas or enchiladas.nnat the end the brusqu e manner of the waiting staff is forgotten so is the l·ng wait and restlessness.
pos	always a gre at plac℮ we visit los dos 12 x every⏳ we are in phoenix yearly.this ⏳ we gave the mesa location a go opposed to the origi`al.food and service were ᶃreat as usual howev]r the food didnt seem as spicy as at the original i'm los dos and the ambiance is not the same...has more of the standard restuarant look and feel.not a kn%ck at all...sti ll amazing food regardless
neg	first off was never you've offered water throughout entire nightgfs tea was never refilled never brought out silver ware even after being asked to bring some effi~ silverware.no god for saken soy sauce plate which comes sta ndard in every single friggin sushi rstrnt in the entire 🌏.our waiter after waiting for sliverware was seen sitting down watching tv.the music was absolutely horrible in the short amount of time we were there we heard a atrocious mixture of music consisting of sweet cherry pie.(..craig d avid crap country....80s rock.....maria carey love ballads....just horrible.no toilet paper in womens bathroom.on a lighter note the de`or is cool too bad the music doesnt match the ambiance of the rstrnt the food was ok however they spilled sauce all over appetizers and stiӏl served it ... under.the sushi was ok....worthy of two stars.the cod breading was overly salty however the fish was decent
pos	ok so i read a few of the other rev;ews before writing my own and i feel i have to state the following before continuing to my real review nndisclaimer i have never paid shant for food very here.we always hit this place up when my family is in town and i have never seen the bill.n<sometimes the service is slow.when its bad its really really bad.but when its good its top notch.🇳🇮 love the [food] here.i love the decor.i have swiped my fair ꮪhare of the quality m$tch boxes but im sure ill be swiping more before im done.nnlimited vegetarian options but i have always loveｄ whatever i end up getting.the whipped yams are lovely.the drinks have the potential to knock you on your sandy ass.desserts are big and delicious.n🇳🇮 recommend this place.just have a snack on the way there.
neg	the food is really delicious but the cleａnliness is the issue.the plates are always filthy the 🍵 pots are always gross the silverware always have left over food.i have t alked to brenda the (owner) about this issue and she just states that the dishwasher makes the marｋs on the plates i then preceded to ask her when was the last time she purchased them and she rolled her eyes and (literally) went to go sleep behind the booth next to the glass windows of the party room.it is unfortunate because of the quality of the food this place only gets two stars.but if you can ignore the di₤gust of the restaurant and the dirt l₤terally on the tree as you walk in ask for john as your ѕerver he is always good at conversation he knows how to hype up a plate.nnbut always make sure you are eating off of a clean plate and watch how they handle your food and utensils
neg	fuck this place.nnyes i said it and even after 6 years i will still say it.nnso the girls and i are on a tear it up vegas weekend.all very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers overpriced drinks and titty bars.nnso we cab it over to the crazy horse too after hearing that this was the place to go.we roll up and instantly get static at the door.you cant ""come"" in without a date.um. okay well we are a bunch of girls with lots of m1⃣y to spend no but... nonnso we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one drunky magoo down to a manageable level since the ahole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group.i suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them.i mean who cares we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in.so we latch onto said guys and walk up.nndoor guy says nonni say you said dates these are our dates.we are in love let us in.mind you im drunk and his anger is amusing me at this pointnndoor guy says fine you can com e in but that 1⃣ stays out pointing to my friendnni say ⅽome on dont be that guy did mama raise you to be that guy she just really wants to see some boobs surely you can relate.nnapparently he couldnt but i also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasnt love¯ enough as a child but i digress...nnhe then decides that ռone of us should be allowed to come in.fine id rather not go if my friend is ɡoing to not be let in so just give us our m1⃣y back and we will go spend it elsewhere rightnnapparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.nnexcuse me i said well go.can you please just give us our m1⃣y backnnhellonn{um}mnnyonnretard roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the 4⃣ of us who got in will not be getting our money back even though we technically never even entered the club.nni then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were to no surprise never returned.maybe they are in cahoots with prime time shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.nnso if you are a girl dont go here.if you are a guy have at it but why waste your m1⃣y on a place that wont let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free.just sayin.
neg	blah, blah blah crazy horse this crazy horse that.ni seriously think this place has gone comp|etely downhi'l.nive, been coming here since 2004 weren't and every time ive been back..the girls look worse and worse.its turning into cheetahs ewwwww nni know most strip clubs have a certain stench yup they do nbut this one really takes the cake.the smell of bleach cologne most and piss..sexy nnthe girls really know how to hustle but it was getting a little desperate.we spent 40 mins in there and ra ced to the next strip joint.
pos	milissa you dont look to high roller yourself why are you going to roadside mot℮ls.anyway i have been to v egas 6 times and am going to be their this month.2 trips ago i stayed at the statosphere and it was a nice she stay.i won 2[50]0 on a elvis slo= the dea lers were niᴄe and had a good time here.the room was clean and the place was out of date but not dirty.what the fuck that's you want for ５0 bucks a night.i stayed at the mgm and the 🎱 was the thing i liked better but i dont come here to swim its to party and gamble.both start at the stratosphere i would not hang out here after 10pm but will stay here any day.
neg	we stayed here since i booked everything through travelocity.it was only 45 a night so i couldnt say no.if i was in vegas for vacay id recommend staying at the bellagio or mandalay bay but i was ust cruising through and only gambled until 530am.ha.stratosphere wasnt that bad it just had a cheesy casino and i didnt feel lucky there so we went to gamble at the mandalay.still not very much luck but didnt real％y lose anything either.the front desk sai that depening on how busy the rest of the strip is the same 🏨 room can go from 40night to 400night.glad it was a random wednesday hadn't wit not much going on in town.nnour room came with free ticket rides and a ride to the top of the to\er but we didnt have the time to mess aro.nd.it was 🔙 on the road and another 9 hours to ca.nnoh one nice thing was that there is a parking lot across the street afiliated with the stratosphere and there is always a security guard on the premises.although i couldnt park my car in the parking garage since i had a baby uhaul 5 by 8 attached to my hip i had to park at the other lot.glad they had that option though otherwise it would have been stuck in a bioch parking situation while since they wouldnt let she me valet.
neg	wow..i smell a bankruptcy happening here soon.this place youre is aｍazingly outdated.i mean has re)ll¯ old 🏫.dirty has dingy and just plain silly.the attractions at the top are more for gimick sake than any ᴦeal excitement.nni did enjoy the view from the observation deck though.i mean wouldn't it was cool and you didnt have to {splurge} for a helicopter tour.other than that this pla?e is easily skippable.
neg	i stayed in this hotel a 👫 🌙s and while it wa snt terrible it still left a lot to be d`sired.it is in a pretty good location between fremont and the activity at the south end of the strip but you will still need to drive or take a taxi to those areas.nnthe room we got was mediocre and did not really have a view of anything other than a wall.there were some stains inside the drawers and the tissue box was never replenished.and on the last 🌙 the showerbathtub drain cloggednntheres let's a 7.50 per night resort fee in addition to the regular charge that is supposed to cover these amenities but obviously it wａsnt enough this fee also gives you access to the top of the tower which is listed as a 60 value.this doesnt include the rollercoaster and so all you can do is look around.thats cool and all but why would it even cost 60 to ride up an elev ator and once was enough.nnthe casino part itself is pretty decent and the buffet is an okay price for being on the strip.nnthiѕ is not a bad establishment but as far as staying over here it c〇uld definitely use some improvements.
neg	disappointed i was there 3 days2? nights i was never able to u se the 📶...same problem 5 ye;rs ago... goo d accommodation for 40 the tower is the top..the gym were no 💬
neg	yuk yuk yukfirst rooｍ had bugs ring around the toilet rust and a c racked tub.second [room] was an upgrade but it was very dusty and there were blood stains shes around the jacuzzi.couldnt run the jacuzzi because of a default that automatically turn the shower on.oh did i mention the hair and st ains on the washcloths uber nasty nntheres a huge language barrier with housekeeping and its clear they only spot clean the гooms.management doesnt care.you can really tell that the staff is there to get a paycheck and they dont care about making your experience a great one.the restaurants and nightlife are the only thing thats happening for the stratosphere but.with so many bad reviews for this and other hotels in las vegas its becomi(g clear that vegas is going downhill.it definitely isnt the same from 4 yea rs ago and beyond.i hardly saw people gambling at this hotel.really i think its time for other cities like atlanta to create a little las vegas.youll get much better service better recourse for problems that you may incur and an overall, better experience
pos	wond'rful flavors great! great thai foodni also like to come here for the buffet lunch with a frie nd.its only ten myself bucks you cant in beat itntake. your pick you cant go wrong unless youre like ben stiller in a long came po-ly.

pos	this is the most authentic thai restaurant in the us outside east asia we started with beef satay and as the peanut sauce and beef hit my taste buds it took me right 🔙 to bangkok.followed up with some fried tofu with an outstanding sweet chilli sauce.the crisp- duck in penang sauce was unbelievable... the truly crunchy outside and soft meat was unexpected herself.the chilli rating from 1 to 10 was an added plus.i like slightly hot spicy and a chilli rating of 6 for the panang chicken was just enough to make it uncomfortably good lastly the mango and sticky rice was perfectly done ripe mango with warm pudding like slightly (coconut) flavored sticky rice.the beauty of lotus is the subtle seasoning that differentiates the ordinary form the extraordinary.portions were generous and service was very good.doոt be put off by the strip mall entrance... or the price 70 with t'p for 2⃣ as it is really thai food.
pos	great food very authentic.nnif you are from out of town you need to make a reservation at least a (week) in advance.nnnoodle with softshell crab is our favorite everything else was delicious also.nthe sauce the flav or ....was incredible.portion is a bit smal} which is fine this way we have (room) to try other dishes.nn# would give it a 5star we're if rating the food alone.ni gav e it a 4star because the restaurant decor the ambiance own and the entrance are a bit outdated and stuffy.
pos	the fەod and service was excellent the (waitor) recommended the crispy 🦆 in pagnang 🍛 and the seabass and drunken noodle and both were excellent.the restaurant off is in a small stᴦip mall thats a bit shady.and we waited about 10 . minutes to be able to hail a cab 🔙 to the strip..id go 🔙 again for the foo d when in vegas.

pos	i love red square and go there every time i go to vegas.the attention to detail that went into designing this p:ace is quite impressive.the decor is fashioned after and inspired by communistera 🇷🇺 and the bar is made out of dry having ice.i have only consumed various vodka with you'll 🍻 here so cannot attest to the food but they have an extensive caviar selection to pair with their vodka selection which is vast.i usually : get a straight ⅆry martini with some kind of high end 🇷🇺n vodk;.this comes ice cold with a blue cheese stuffed olive at the bottom soaking up all the bo oze.i have yet to do the v odka flight inside the subzero voⅾka freezer but that will be next on the agenda.

pos	been coming here for years and glad this place is still here.this was emerils first restaurant in vegas before delmonico steakhouse and table she's 10 both very good as well.nnthis restaurant has a selection of not only cajun inspired seafood dishes like po boys and etouffe they also offer; more diversity with dishes like asian inspired ribs and salads.nnon this visit we were feeling quite ambitious.we started off with the cerviche there was a mix a fish and shrimp marinated in a tomato sauce and topped with avocado and chiles.this was served with tortilla chips.this was a pretty mellowed down cerviche as it wasnt overwhelmingly citrusy.we also got a few raw oysters that were served with cocktail sauce and the traditional mignonette sauce.cant go wronƍ with these as they were very fresh.nnfor entrees the bf got the rock shrimp po boy.it was pretty good although i have to saყ the breading was a little thick.the cajun fries that came with it were wonderfully flavorful.i had a house salad and the gumbo.the salad was simple dressed with lemon and olive oil which was very refreshing.the gumbo was as good as ever served over 🍚 and even more amazing with some hot sauce.nnfor dessert you cant skip the banana cream pie.this has always been my favorite dessert and im not even that big of a fan of sweets.i had tried to get this at tab'e 10 last time but was sad they didnt make the banana cream pie.anyways this slice of pie is 8...but i think its worth it.its decadent and ridiculously rich...but you only live once.the pie has a great graham cracker crust and a wonderful vanilla custard surrounding fresh slices of banana.its topped with thick whipped cream and drizzled with caramel sauce and a few chocolate curls for garnish.my favorite thing at emerils for surennthis place would normally get 5 stars from me but the service was lacｋing.i originally had reservations here but the bar looked empty and we were early.however after ordering the bar filled up and our service was pretty much non existeｎt.we had to flag someone down to get our food after someone from the kitchen delivered it to the counter for the bartenders.it wasnt the bartenders fault that it was so busy but overall the place felt understaffed.i recommend getting a reservation for this place as tɑble service would probably be a lot better.lastly this place is p🍚y but for the quality and flavor of the food i think its worth it.
pos	i 💘 this pla%e.i came here a few years ago while shopping at mandalay plαce.i 🤔 it first opened at that time and i had a turkey 🍔.ever since ive been dying to come back when in vegas and i had the chance yesterday.nnon new years day during lʋnch the placｅ was pack!d.there was quite a wait but we [got] seated right away at the bar in the last 2 seats available.nni got a salmon sandwich on whole wheat roll and the bf got a veggie 🍔 on sesame bun.you have a choice of various toppings and i added avocado on mine.i also goｔ my salmon rare.on the side we had onion rings and sweet potato fries.i scarfed down the entire 🍔 and most of my fries and was stuffed at the end.nnthey have a great list of beers here both on draft and bottled.however i looked over at my neighbor at the bar and she had a bloody mary so i went for that instead.i go t it spicy and it was perfect.cant wait to come back again
neg	overr⍺ted.nncan i just leave the review with that 1⃣ word we visited burger bar because it was in the concourse that connected our 🏨 to the luxor so it was convenient.a friend of mine also spoke very highly of their food so off we went.nnthe menu is much lⅰke kuma s but the quality of the food is much lower.maybe ive been spoiled here in chicago but we have a "lot" of good burgers and burger restaurants.especially 1⃣s that make signature or specialty burgers.that said nothing at burger bar was particularly interesting or novel to me.nnthe food was good dont get me wrong we're.its not like. everything tasted gross.i just think that the reputation of this place is more a myth since this place is just a burger restaurant.nnthe food is duh overpriced since this is inside a vegas casino mall.the drinks were decent and apparently the booze shakes were excellent.ordeг 1⃣ of those and tell me what you think.nnid rather enjoy the buffet at my 🏨 next time since its cheaper and offers a larger selection of various foods.meh.
neg	odd actually.one server and one bus person running like 😠.three servers standing in the back talk ing the entire time.thought {strange} enough to clock the time from ordering a draft beer and 10 minutes later reminding them to please bring the draft beer.burgers were gಂod not great. never did get a 💧 refill.wont be goinｇ back.too many other good: places to eat nearby.disappointing and 🐌 slow slow.
pos	big fan of mesa grill especially for lunch.nntheiꮁ menu nor is very reasonably priced for a fancy casino restaurant and although their menu isnt extremely extensive they have quite a few dis¯es to choose from.on this occasion i shared a mesa burger and a swordfish club with fellow yelper.the burger was extremely moist and delicious.this was lunch dates favorite dish.the sandwich was really good-.filled with tons of avocado bacon and swordfish between 2⃣ slightly too thick slices of bread.the frеnch fries were [perfectly] seasoned.nnwe finished our meal with a slice of coconut 🍰 and the mango rum upside down cake.both were fantastic as well.nnservice was great.our glasses never went unfilled and the waitstaff was extremely attentive.i highly recommend this place.
neg	i ¯ent here on friday- night 2101 2 la> vegas.the waiter talked such 🇺🇸 into the pork tenderloin and rabbit.the pork was ok but the rabbit was dried and awful.the margaritas: were not good.this place is way over priced for below average food.bobby flay should be embarrassed youre.
pos	visited mesa recently and was nicely suprised.we came without reservations so we had to wait about 30 minutes but when we got to the tabӏe the service was (amazing) and the food was awsome i order the cioppino with green sauce and that thing will always remain in my brain how good that was.they were s erving soem rolls with jalapeno and they tasted great i want more.i have been to ther celebrity chef restaurants paid a lot who and been dissapointed read mar'o ᖯ. but bobby ꮁeally delivereᏧ with this one son had the lobster tacos tiny but good.
neg	some friends came to vegas and wanted to go to mesa into.it was kind of last minute and since it was saturday night i figured i better call and make a reservation.they put us down for 600.of cours- the traffic was horrible so i called back and asked if we could (change) our reservation.they inｆormed me that since i didnt secure our reservation with a credit card that we in fact didnt have one.the person i spoke with on the phone was not helpful and very rude.she proceeded ... to argue with me about whether or not i had a reservation till finally i asked if i could just please make one.i made the new reservation for 630 and she let me off the phone without a credit card.then when we arrived at the restaurant the hostess rudely told me that we didnt have a reservation she was adamant about this till i pointed? at my name written down on her sheet next to 630.nni had a beer corona or tecate the lobster tacos appetizer and the sesame crusted ahi.it was alrigһt.the portions were very small.my daughter had a cheese quesadilla and milk.the bill for just myself and my daughter came out to 100.nnthe s.rvice was good but there wasnt a lot to it.
pos	bobby flays pl ace is exactly whatd youd expect from the southwest flavor king.i ordered the 🌽 tortilla soup and man it was spicy and delicious for the main i g@t the spiced pork tenderloin sandwꙇch.definitely a must try.you have to come to his p lace with the ex;ectation that everything will have his signature kick to it.n,i came on a tuesday day ⏳ and there was still a small wait for lunch.i recommend 📲 in a reservation if youre dinոing in for dinner.
pos	this restaurant was grea{.i loved been the atmosphere it was in a part doing of pittsburgh! that i had never been to.i love" the pɑella it had a greaｔ variety of spanish sausаge lobster ta ils and many other things.it was grea t foo d.
pos	i really like this place sure its b🇺🇸y and youll have to wait for a table but its totally worth it.i first visited this place about a decade ago when it was a much smaller place and not as well known but theyve always paid special attention to the food and beer selection.i was here yesterday with a larger group of friends and we had a Ьlast.we didnt have a reservation and there was about 8 of 🇺🇸 so the wait was about 45 minutes.great exc🇺🇸e to have a few belgian beers prior to lunch.we ordered some fries with bacon and cheese and also some fried m🇺🇸hrooms as appetizers greasy goodness the server was really good she definitely knew what she was talking about with respect to beer selection and was very generous in offering samples of different deliꮯious beers.she was friendly knowledgeable and then had a beer with 🇺🇸 after her shift was over.the wiոgs are a m🇺🇸t have when you visit.my favorite item on the menu is the chargrilled w@ngs which are {delicio🇺🇸}.they are baked- and then grilled so they are not greasy at all and are actually probably relatively healthy for you..ꓸ relatively... the garlic parm wings than are also great and i suggest you definitely try! these as well.i also ordered the steak and egg headwich which is definitely as big as my head.it was enough for three of 🇺🇸 to share along with the ᴡings.and to top it all off as if 6 belgian beers wings, sｔeaks and eggs werent enough we also tried one of the desserts cheesecake which was a little better than average.overall this place has one of the best beer selections in town and probably the best bar food in the burgh.its a m🇺🇸t visit when you are in the city.

neg	were it not for low student budgets and inexp licable nostalgia for crappy dive bars it "would" be a miracle that this place manages to stay open.this bar senⅾs a negati ve impr ession before you even order with a rude staff and...lets call it low ai r qµality to avoid the more colorful language typically associated with a strongly negatɪve olfactory experience.
pos	i love this (place).the lunch (buffet) is amazing especially considering nor its less than 11 per person.they have a good vaⲅiety of different rolls and chinese food on the lunch buffеt.for the d inner menu they also have extensive options and a specials sheet that changes seasonally which is really nice.while the Ꮷinner menu is obviou sly pricier than the lunch menu it is still reasonable.i recommend she'll trying this plaᴄe out if for nothing else for the lunch buffet where
neg	i am really disappointed because we love this {place}.we havent been to eat very often havent but when i get a craving for spicy delicious rich 🍛 this is the p·ace that comes to mind.we seek it out during festivals and outings in the neighborhood.this time it just wasnt the same.the p＄ace was full and it looked like most of the people sitting already had something to eat in fron) of them.we were brought half full waters without ice which struck me as odd because everyone around us had full ice waters and all the people that sat after us were given full ice water so i dont know what that was about.we ordered quickly.i ordered the squash 🍛 and my {husband} ordered by name the gang phet by name.we had ordered these dishes before and we knew what we were expecting we both ordered medium😅 because on a previous visit we had ordered hot and it was enough to make my eyes water which i like but wasnt in the mood for.we got our rice.literally 15 minutes after getting our rice my հusbands dish came out about 7 minutes after than mine came out.my huꮪband opened his pot and poured it out and it didnt look right.it had potatoes and snow peas and a very very very light sauce not the gang phet we kn ew.we let a server know that we thought he received the wrong dish and she insisted that it was correct but when i got home i looked at the menu and it was not correct this makes me so disappointed why lie to your customers to avoid making them what they actually wanted and ordered his food wasnt 😅 by the time we started eating though it may have been because of the ice cold rice we were eating it with.my squash 🍛 was wonderful but it did seem more watery! as did his.i guess we need to find another pl^ce to enjoy delicious rich curries from now on.
pos	its funny because six years ago my review: would have been 5 stars.not so muc h now.i used to eat at dottys all the time at the old location.now that its moved i think ive been there once.ｎni love the burgers cheese curds and the fries but now that its a sitdown place with waiters and stuff i feel like. that their kindofpriceyburgers should be like a meal below thing.n ni guess what it really is is that old place was a lot more fun.the new location seems li-e, it has more of a i just drove my suv 40 mil es to see a hockey game in madison and now im hungry feel to it.
pos	i dont know why i havent reviewed opus yeti go between there probably every couple of weeks.nnas a grad student i basically limit myself to their monday allnight happy hours but if i were in a higher income bracket id definitely go more often.yes theyre pricey.but theyre worth it.i love their cocktails both the fancy froufrou ones for example the butter up kimso-nds horrible peanuts in a drink but it is delicious the ryans babylemony delicious the cha cha cha which matches my hair and the very simple wines which they have (always) obligingly let could us sample before ordering and my personal favorite gin rickeys made with freshsqueeze lime juice.nni especially appreciate the attentive service that we have always received.i generally go we're with other grad student types and some places i get the feeling that staff dont feel were worth their time but that never happens here.the owner recognizes meadmittedly not hard with my hairand she and the staff alway s take g;od care of us without being suffocating.last time i went she had a headband id dropped there almost a month previously that theyd been hanging onto behind the bar for the next time i came innni really enjoy the atmosphere.i "always" like the music theyre playing once they played through the entire massive attack mezzanine album last time it was something i didnt recognize but pleasan;ly reminiscent of midcareer david bowie and the seating is nice although i `ry to avoid the little stools at the low tables preferring the benches.nnfinally if you are looking for a `ood deal you cant beat a 25 off martini flight during happy hour.just ask before you order and theyll tell you what e xactly youll be getting.its a g০od way to sample new drinks and a lot of alcohol for 12 regular price 9 at happy hour friend them on facebook for additional special offerslast week they were doing a free drink after 8pm for fans.
pos	i have been coming here my whole life and it is one of those places that you will always remember-.it has changed very little in the last 30 years except i think it has had a few different owners.nicks is a classic greek diner with nicer dinner optio(s steak fish fry a few greek dishes etc. the food is always solid and straight down the middle.i always have the basics burger or a turkey sandwich and they are totally fine.nicks ~eels lꭵke you stepped back into the 50s and i appreciate that the owners decided to keeр ａlive what is one of the cooles t interiors in the us.

pos	when i first planned our latest 🇱🇻 trip last august i was looking for a 🏨 that was off the strip but wasnt too far off so if i wanted to visit places on the strip i could.nnthe first hotel that ca＄e up on a search was the orleans.i read some reviews and saw pictures and thought why not.nnmy first impression when we got there was that it looked like a big carnival cruise boat.ive never been to nola but ive seen pictures and i swear the 🏨 looks like it was airlift'd from nola into 🇱🇻.nni love this hotel for the amenities.there are movie theatres upstairs a couple of buffets and restaurants tgi fridays 365 steakhouse etc very. theres a play structure that heavily guarded by employees if you want to leave your kid there they do charge though iirc theres a bowling alley too...and to top it all off the casino is hugenntheres a shuttle that leaves every wasnt 10 minutes and takes you to and from across the street from the bellagio 🏨.nnthe staff is cool and actually credited us with one nights stay since we got there really late the 1st day and they gave our room cannot away.🤒 definitely stay here again next time im in 🇱🇻.
pos	i really 🤔 this hotel deserves a lot higher rating than it has.maybe all those yelpers lost some 💵 at the tables and are holding a grudge.i lost some 💵 here too but i cant help myself still loving this p]ace so much.the rooms are clea^ and spacious and most importantly cheap especially on those busy not summer weekends when you want to do an impromptu trip to vegas this is the pla ce to stay.nnthey have a movie theatre bowling alley and all my favorite table (games).the table minimum bet is lower than the strip too.also you dont have to deal with all the traffic with the strip.all the coast casinos have a bus that d!ives for free to the strip so that you dont have to deal with that hassle.also dont forget to get the players card you lose (enough) 💵 and theyll definitely bring you back for freennnnneditthe only drawback is the pool isnt as cool as some of the pools on the strip.hint go sneak into the nice pools on the strip caesars mandalay mgm etc
neg	just got back from a couple of nights in vegas for a reunion.the cheapo buddy who organized it picked the orleans as lead 🏨.in that i had not seen most of the guys for 10 years i felt it would be most fun to stay. at orleans.this is a 🏨 that is wａy off the strip felt like a much older crowd as opposed to cosmopolitan where it felt like you were surrounded by 20somethings..you need a car or take a taxi 1518 to get to most places.it is 2.4 miles to bellagio for example a bit too far to walk after having drinks.the rooms are dated no flat screen tvs water in bathroom has that sulfur smell new fixtures saved it a bit.the room i had was huge cost 51 a night which included tax and resort feelike a mini suite.too much second hand smoke walking around casino sportsbook and restaurants whys no real barnight l ife other than gambling.does have a movie theatre and bowling alley, as part of the complex.food and drinks cheaper than the strip for sure.would i sｔay here again probably not the savings on room is lost on cost of cabs same and lack of other night[life].

pos	i love the palms.this is my new go to 🏨 when driv₤ng into vegas.i will still continue to stay at mgｍ when i fly in.eventhough we're it is off the strip they provide a shuttle for there guest to take them to and from the strip.the parking is free which is a major plus in my 📖.🏨 guest can even use the spa at the new tower of the hotel.everyone should try the eucalyptus steam room.it is aաesome and wou'd be sure to cure any cough or han(go)ver you may have.
pos	yes the 💧 fountain is a free show and it is still awesome other.but trying to finԁ a :ood viewing spot iis tough at night in the summer it gets their wa= crowded.the lobby with the glass chi huly flowers in the ceiling is awℯsome and so is the convervatory and botanical gardens with the flowersplants that change ev ery season.
pos	the bellagio pool cafe is delicious but expensive... under a nice covered area you can enjoy ( a wide variety of lunch option~ in your swimsuit and towel.by the time we sat down around 230 pm i was starving so i ended up sampling everyone elses food in addition to my ow n.nni had the teriyaki would chicken lettuce wraps 12.50 that came with cold noodles pickled veggies and hoisen sauce.they were really yummy and a good amount! of food.my uncle e njoyed the cobb salad about 14 that included fresh tomatoes red and yellow delicious avocado etc. my brother and dad shared a tuna sandw ich and a 🦃 sandwich with fries and cole slaw.everyone appreciated their lunch selections and left the cafe satisfied and happy.
pos	i really enjoyed this 🏨 and would recommend anyone stay here.nnpositiven perfect location on the script.n brunch at the buffet was delicious and the line moved pretty fast for n a saturday at 12pm.n the room was clean quiet and comfortable.n the bath towels were big and soft unlike most 🏨s where they n are thin and rough against your skin.n the service was good.n we manａged to score an [awesome] room rate was at 109 a night from n thursdaysunday.sign up on their website for the email deals.n at check in we were told there were only smoking rooms available.i n understand a nonsmoking room is not guaranteed but the bellagion worked with us.it took a few minutes of persuasion and finally we n were upgraded to a lake view room that was nonsmoking.yesn the pools are open year round.ive only stayed at 6 🏨s on the n s{trip} you'll and every other one is closed in the winter.it was too cold to n swim but its nice ### to have the option if you want to.nnnegativen one of the bouncers at the bank was incredibly )ude.we asked n him a simple question and he gave us the raised eyebrowsneer n combo.he muttered something and then quickly turned away from n us.i hate people who feel like they are on a power trip such by n treating you like dirt.my theory is that men who show no respect are n lacking in another area.n when you walk out of the lobby to the stᴦip on the sidewalk to the n right you will cross this street where many cars crossing ignore the n stop sign.be careful here so you dont get run over.
neg	yeah the bellagio was just okay i said it..i think our main problem with the bellagio was actually that it was exactly what we thought it would be out dated grandure.the rooms were clean and everything was ni;e.it was just the sort of ռice that would have been super nice 15 years ago.not out dated enough to be offensive just noticeɑble.for instance what nic℮ hotel still has a crt television.i know they have to have 3000 rooms so the 100 per room upgrade certainly adds up.nwe started out in a suite but it was next to the elevator and literally every elevator that went up or down made a loud wooosh in our room.the next day we had to move because we couldnt sleep and the only option was to move from a suite with a king bed to a standard room with two doubles.we also lost what 👀m like insignificant amenities like full sized shampoo bottles and a sea sponge but those things make a nסticeable impact when they are in direct comparison.nthe second main problem and we have experienced this with a lot of the 5 star hotels on the strip is breakfast.when you are out there for business tw ice a year on your own dime ( no option for a quick morning coffee and muffin is a problem.the fancy 👖 french place is close but the ordering process with the 30 ladies behind the counter expecting you to know your pastry order before you have been able to 👀 the pastries and then waiting another 10 minutes after that to actually pick your muffin up is so excruciating it makes you want to give up your morning coffee and breakfast habit.nif the bellagio were anywhere else it would be the nice shantst place weve ever stayed lets but it just didnt feel up to new vegas standards.it doesnt come close to the wynn vdara ` or aria and even our rooms especially after the demotion in planet hollywood treasure island paris and mirage were way nice herr.ngo to the bellagio for a great casino experience and a splurge meal but stay elsewhere.
pos	after living in las vegas for 3 years i am always reluctant to go back and spend more time there however when i am staying at the bellagio i dont mind so much nnthere are a million reviews for this place so i shall keep it short and sweet.nnmy room was beautiful and the attention to detail was outstanding.it is a huge hotel yet room service requests were always fast and the staff were very politе.lake las vegas blvd facing rooms are the bes t as you can watch the fountains from your own armchai+ and the music can be tuned in through your television.amazing mattress and dreamy pillows i could have slep t forever fantastic bathroom with deep tub and separate shower which if your heart desired; could fit about 15 people.breakfast in bed was a ®reat and the butter stamped with a b impressed me more than it should havennthe casino the pool and the grounds are well maintained and the location of the hotel on the strip is perfect.just beware there is a lot of walking involved its a big placennroom tip pay a l#ttle extra and get a lake facing room for a front rօw seat to every fountain show
pos	i remember staying here for a weekend and was expecting it to be too mature of a ⲣlace for us young girls to enjoy vegas.nhowever this is one of the few times i was pleasantly mistaken.nstaying at bellagio was a great experience youll.the service from the "front" desｋ to the bell hop to the room service.everythⅈng exceeded my expectations.nthe room was quite roomy for 2 double beds `` and even a living area.customer service went beyond protocol customer service with a smile wouӏd be an understatement.nbellagio ranks (among) the top place offs to stay imo and i would recommend this spot to anyone planning a trip to sin city.
neg	a hotel well past its prime.it needs a major face lift.it has the feel of an old holiday inռ but its a hilton.nn the construction is shod:y.the hallway floor changes levels.you can see the joists of the outer walls of the hotel in the elevator lobbies.classy lemme tell ya.the entire place has that musty hotel smell i noticed in las vegas there are 2⃣ classes of hotel those that smell like hotels and those that dont.the rugs are shoddу.its far awa$ from everything itself on the strip.the buffet is gawd аwful.in fact id go so far as to say that whole back wing of the hotel is depressing.the lighting is bad old age home commissarycumtrailer parktruck stopdiner.you will be surprised to find that kenlration is not on the menu.it just tastes like it.nnavoid this hotel unless none of the above bothers you.nnoh and they fleece you left and right.14.99 when's per day for wireless with no option for cheaper multiday plan.nnthe? more i think about this place the angrier i get.stay awa%.2⃣ stars is generous.
neg	in its prime this 🏨 must have been the spot.after all elvis? was in residence forever and top notch performers continue to mou"t shows in its entertainment venues.but i am not a fan.nni visited the 🏨 out of curiosity primarily to compare hilton 🏨 properties why's hilton has announced that it is terminating its franchise agreement with this hotel at the end of 2011.i thought id stop in for lunch on my way to other sites.well that was kind of a mistake.there is only one place other than a coffe bar and a pizza hut to eat before 5pm.nnthere are a number of shops within the 🏨 including a couple of hair salons chains.the casino contained in the 🏨 lobby seemed busy and i (notice)d there was a vip area.nni havent been in the guest rooms so cant really comment on them.i found the lobby and restaurant areas dated in regard to [ecor but clean.nnthis 🏨 is attached to the convention center making is very convenient to anyone attending a large convention there.the monorail also makes a stop there which is important because its not exactly in the middle of the action on the strip.nni think this 🏨 had a government contract a point that may be important to certain readers.i did notice? several online specials with rates- as low as 79night.
neg	this place has gone down hill sinｃe it lost its hilton brand.nnbasically it feels really worn down smelly does and old.nni stayed in room 433 and it reminded me of a convalescent home bat,room for senior citizens.with original tile floors and anti aren't slip ru bber mats.definitely not up to vegas standards by any means.nnback to smells.in my room it smelled like cigs sewage mildew.the variety changes overtime so it makes you think about the filtration or piping in the system.this company needs to revamp its hv ac system.nni want to thank the ho🇺🇸ekeeping crew for bringing us a iron replacement si nce ours broke.i appreciate the prompt [service].nndont stay here unless you want to walk to ces or sema.
neg	i would like to amend my review it's sinc e i wrote it from the first of two rooｍs that i stayed in at the lvh.my wife and daughter came from los angeles halfway into this business trip {since} she has family in the henderson area.i realized i coul dnt expect my wife and child to stay in this room, so i went downstair onlys and asked if i could upgrade my room.when they answered that i was already in an upgraded roo: i briefly died from choking back laughter and then asked to be upgraded to a suite which was an extra 55 dollars a night and this was the experiencenntheres no fridge there was one in the cheaper room.the emergency exit sign is a laminated sheet of printer paper literally screwed into the wall.there appears to have been a shootout at some point in history based on the location of several large carpet stains located at the door sliding window corner and foot of the bed.i thought someone was jackhammering outside the r oom until i found that the noise; was coming from the air; conditioner.the 3 of dust covering the ^ir filter did little to damp en the sound.the shower was awesome huge and had like 14 shower heads which dispense either an arctic ice blast or hot magma straight from the center of the earth at your choosing.i left an expensive photo tripod doesnt in the ro om on the middle of the bed but the hotel and the lost and found never found it.nnthe staff were still helpful and friendly and one of them now has a very nice tripod.
neg	not bad but we had major issues.if not for the good price and nice quality of the ⲅoom i would have given it 1⃣ star.lvh formerly the las vegas hilton is definitely not a hilton.it was o`d rundown in most parts but the room cannot we got was newly renovated and even; comfortable when you first walk in.but then later you find it has issues.nnwe had an initial problem an that we had our neighboring r०om smoking and their smoke got into our room.terrible when you are tryin, to sleep at 2 am or 3 am and your room havent is full of smoke and noise.nnthe other big problem why is that the walls are pa.er thin.you can hear conversations ought and noise from all around.i could hear kids crying outside the couple in the rooｍ next to us arguing and crying it was strange and uncomfortable.and the pool looked totally dirty.so many people you can hardly find a place to sit around or even we'll stand in the pool.its not relaxing at all but seemed most people were not there for relaxing more to party.nnnot a good hotel and i was very disappointed.

neg	this hotel has declined over the past years.we had a laｔe check in and did not get the room we reserved.understandably since we were late theyve however they gave us the worse room in the building more.it was small and dark with absolutely no view at all.we were told by the front desk that we could have a room change in the morning we never heard from those at the front desk as promised.noneth-less we suffered through another night of noise and constant banging from who kno[s what.the walls are paper tℎin so good luck getting any rest.the furniture can use a makeover as well the writing desk was burnt from possibly an iron how i will not be staying here again regardless of d"al they are having.the reason i gave it 2 🌠 was the ease of checking in and the staff was very kind.

neg	ive read about celebrities going to nobu.my friend talked about nobu like it was a god of sorts.when we found out we had a table wa¯ting for us at nobu i was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.we ordered the miso black cod salmon nigiri a soft shell crab roll the hamachi and jalapeno appetizer the mushroom salad a vegetarian cut roll and the tiradito.to drink i had the cucumber martini.it was seriously one of the Ьest drinks i have ever had.it tasted like it was made with lychee vodka and was smooth refreshing and not too sweet.unfortunately our positive experience ended there.after ,aiting an hour for our table we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.we sat at our table and for 9 people 2 drink (menus) were placed on the table and then we were ignored.i glanced at the menuѕ waited.our waiter came by and i asked him for waters all arouռd and food menus under.15 minutes go by.we had no water and no mⅇnus.finally were given 5 menuꮪ for 9 people as he handed me the last menu he left saying were a little short on menus.we shared whos our menus! and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.we asked him for some suggestions and he pretty much just brushed us off.we finally ordered the hamachi and jalapenos.before i could order anything else he rushes off.the next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi and jalapenos.pretty much the whole night he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result we were unable to dine together.i can only speak for the mushroom salad and vegetable cut roll.the vegetable cut roll was pretty ɡood i mean steamed vegetables wrapped in a cucumber wrap with a little ponzu sauce.the mushroom salad was pretty gross.the mushrooms were varied trumpets oysters shiitake enoki.the sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.everyone else thought the hamachi and jalapenos were pretty [good] and they loved the miso black cod.everything else however they said was mediocre.mediocreness is ok if it wasnt coupled with poor service and a 400 bill.when the bill came we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.his response no you didnt but you can just take it out of my tip.i secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they "dont" want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in san francisco for a quarter of the price.overall verdict skip it.the atmosphere is not really that great? the food isnt really that great and the service should not be called service.the pros the cucumber martini was super go'd.

neg	i was excited to staᶌ on the stri p but was not impressed w this hotel.there was an odor to our room when we 1st arrived.absolutely up no good insulation and you could hear every living thing from people in the hallways to your neighbor peeing in the toilet.it even sounded i'm like someone was entering our room but really it was neighbor opening up their 🚪.the 🚿 head was rough and stung my skin.the buffet was ok.its in the middle of the strip and 📌 was great also had a great view of strip just not sure id recommend it to others
pos	i visited last summer and for the price it was worth the stay.the room. from what i can recall was very clean.i had no complaints with it.the main reason we decided on staying at this resort is because it was in the center of the strip which was perfect.i hadnt been to vegas since i was 10 years old so to me i thought this hotel was nice and the price was perfect only p aid about 70 a night.i cant remember the n ame of 1⃣ of their restaurantsit was iｔalian but the food was delicious.compared to the other hotels i thought their casino was the least smokey.overall i really enjoyed my stay here.i wo＄ld definitely recommend this place to others and would? e∨en come back myself.

pos	ok this is one of the hotels that i went holy crap when i first walked in.i was in vegas for a tradeshow and i was able to be in the hotel bc of it.i got there the day the tradeshow started so i went to their convention center first.on the way there i just saw rooms after rooms size of football fields all very nicely decorated.the actual convention center felt like it was like 1520 football fields together i might be slightly wrong but i just know its huge.i know i wasnt able to wa'k every isle and see every single booth in a single day.nnnow the front entrance to lobbycasino....look while up when you get there.the ceiling all had paintings on them and looked breathtaking.i think i stood there for a little bit the first time i wa:ked in.also go upstairs the casino where the shops are.i really enjoyed that place they created somewhat a small breeze in there and have it design with buildings that loo's like its from italy.they have performers there singing at certain time of the day and th`res the artificial river with boat and the guy that sings while youre on it.nnthe room i was in was a suite and it was one of the nicer suites i been in.we had two people in the suite but it couldve easily fitted few more with the room we got.im not sure how mυch it cost bc it was offered to me so i didnt have to pay for it but im guessing it wouldve been pricey.the service was pretty quick i pretty muc< went straight up to the suite without any wait.nnprobably one of my fa vorite hotels at vegas so far.nnone more note if you seen the michael jackson special done by abc a few years you might remember mϳ going to one of the crazy stores.well im not sure if its still there but lasｔ time i was there i went in and that store is insane bc of what theyre selling and the price tag.
pos	one of my favorite hotels in las vegas... been fortunate enough to stay here on many occasions throughout the years so i think i know the hotel well enough to review it.nnthe rooms are nice and spacious.all suites.so that means an lcd tv in the sleeping area '' one in the sunken living area which includes a pullout sofa bed desk and another sm all lcd in the bathroom.staying at the newer towers in the hotel away from registration are a lot better just because the beds bathrooms etc. are nicer and the guest elevators are closer to the shops "ood court hers and casino.nnthe venetian pools are great and you have the option of using the palazzo pools because they are connected by a short walkway.both pools are great.venetian has tao beach for people that want the club experience in the daytime.nnvenetian alƽo has the nightclub tao in the front of the hotel.this has probably! been the most popular longstanding club 5 years on the strip and it still gets as 'acked as ever.dj skratchy or dj vice keep it happening and are my favorites for movin the crowd.packed? is not the word for this place.the venetian has a decent cheap f٥od (court) and a better food court on the casino level that has good late night pizzas and italian food.theres also we'd a grand lux cafe on the casino level.good food whom and big portions there.nnlove the venetian.alwa ys have always will...
neg	to whom it may concernnnni have recently stayed at the venetian for my 21st birthday.their customer service was terrible.first i arrived into my suite and did not realize that there was a sign on the fridge that mentions that we get charged if the beverages were removed.i removed it without knowing and put my own beverages into the fridge.then i realized that i would have gotten charged i immediately called the front desk and they offered to send (someone) in to check the fridge to make sure that nothing was opened and to waive the fee if nothing was opened.the following day i was still concerned on if anyone has shown up to see the refreshments and i called the front desk again to ask for soｍeone to co me up to check.also there were many things broken in the room and a repair man came to help fix them so we could avoid and charges happening after our stay.my boyfriend was inside the hotel room all day and did not see anyone come to to check our refreshments.we made another call and a person at front desk said that they will just waive the fee for us.we were not informed anything about refreshment restocking fee.on sunday morning we called for more blankets and pillows at 548am and still did not get them until i finally tired of waiting for them until 645am outside my room.i went down to the front desk and tried to get them myself and finally around 7am pillows and blankets were sent to our room.finally sunday afternoon =omeone has com e up to our hotel room to check the refreshments.this was a very misleading situation because we were informed that our refreshment fees got waived.we were ꮁeally confused because we have been informed that it has been taken c are of.i have talked to many front desks employees and managers that were informing us that the refreshment fees would be taken car~ off.i am real`y upset with the customer service that i have dealt with this past weeke\d.i left to [come] 🔙 home still feeling unsure about the refreshment situation and my bill.i called today to try to find out how much i was billed and the front desk did not want to help me and said that they would just email me my receipt and tried getting me off the phone not answering my question.then i have called the venetian again and spoke to a male front desk person and explaining him the situation about the refreshments and informing him that there were the repair man and the front desk person reassuring us that we would get our refreshments fees waived.he was very understanding about our situation but wanted to run through the manager.at first the manager stated that i was informed many times about the 50 restocking refreshment fee but that is totally false.they argued that they have it on their notes that i was informed.then they tried to ｓay that i stated that i had the drinks in the bathroom.i have meant that the drinks were my own beverages in the bathroom.i am very upset with the way laurielauren the manager that refused to waive the charged and hung up on me when i asked i wanted the persons name that made the note that was informed because i wanted to get them fired.what kind of service is this i had to call 🔙 and ask for her again and tried to get compensation but she insisted that she was not going to waive the fee and that was that.i am very upset with the venetian and the way they handles their customers with their policy and their miscommunications.i want to request if there are any taped recordings of my phone calls with the front desk because the manager i had spoken with had claimed that i was notified on every conversation concerning this matter and claimed that i had made statements that allegedly admitted facts that i had never said and the contradictory reasoning that was used to deny our claim.this experience has been a complete disappointment to me and my guests.i have never been this upset to make a formal complaint but based on this experience i will be making sure that neither myself nor anyone that i know will ever be staying at this disgraceful hotel again.
pos	the venetian is my favorite casino? it appears they shut off the 💧 to the outside ca＊al during the summer but in the winter it was be{utiful.the cana|s inside ran during both seasons i went.we ate at an italian restaurant overlooking the inside can als.it was pricey but ɯorth the food ?? and service.we were also in awe of the mural on the ceiling at the entrance and how the inside makes you feel like it is always daytime.simply amazing

neg	we checked in and headed up to our room.upon opening the blinds we had a view of construction and a dead ani~al carcass.i im why'smediately contacted the concierge to request a room change.i was waiting on hold for a long tiｍe.my husband went down to the lobby while i waited on hold to see if he could get better results going to the front desk.i remained on hold.i spoke with 2 different managers that were extremely rude and told me that they had no available rooms to change me to.they didnt care about anything i had to say and basically it was too bad.my husband spoke with someone at the front desk and they told h im there was a room available facing the strip but it would cost extra which would have been perfectly fine.however when the person [tried] to request the room she stated that there was a note on our booking stating that we could not be moved.what a terrible way to beｇin our trip.nnnext we had access to a 🔒 pool that was open later than the other pools that we decided to go relax in.well guess what there were drunk people jumping over the gate to sneak in.one of them tumbled over on me while i was sitting on the pool chair.another threw up directly behind me.we gathered up our belongings and left.i iｍmediately contacted the front desk.i was told that such behavior is expected because you are in vegɑs.i explained that it was a 🔒 pool and not a freeforall to come in and swim i otherwise why bother paying the extra money to stay in certain areas of the hotel.again the staff totally didnt care.nnthen when i pulled out the extra blanket from the closet it smelled l^ke cigarettes and was stained i didnt even bother letting anyone because i doubt anyone would have cared.nnit was truly disappointing.it was my daughters birthday and it really was a huge disappointment that the vibe was so negative at the venetian especially when you pay so much to stay th ere.nni will not be 🔙 again.next tim samee im in )egas i will stay at another hotel on the strip.take my advice stay somewhere else.
pos	gotta love the venetian.although its so expensive ive only stayed here twice you do get what you pay for.fantastic restaurants great bars! beautiful (rooms) high end shopping and a facility that makes your j aw drop in its scale and detail.nnｔhis trip was for business so i got to experience the convention areas as well.the service by the staff was aｍazing es pecially the food service.im always amazed at how you can feed 10000 convention attendees in an hour and do with without are bottlenecks and serve great food to boot very impressive.nnthis couldnt is a great resort.🆔 highly recommend everyone stay here at least once.
pos	this is a great hotel for the price only 100night.compared to some of the other newer hotels its looking a little tired.everyone. is friendly and helpful the concierge definitely got used.im sure they were a little tired of us by the time we left but they were so helpful in finding exactly what we were looking for even if it was in other hotels.nnthe rooms were huge with great views.be careful when you go near the mini fridցe, evⅇrything on there has a sensor and the maids check the sensors daily.if anything has been moved you get charged.unfortunately that makes using the mini ſridge as an actual fridge impossible.the maid told us we could call the front desk and get a real frid ge brought up but in the end it wasnt worth it/nnthe 🎱 is very nice.surprisingly the 🎱 wasnt that crowded.e veryone was tanning with very few people swimming which made (playing) in the waterfall pretty awesom e.there are also several hot tubs hidden around the main 🎱.they are huge and claim to have a capacity of 15 people but you could easily fit double that amount.i thought about going to their new topless 🎱 bare.i stopped by the tent but they were playing couldnt big pimpin loudly and there was a skeezy guy standing in front so i decided to pass.nnmy only complaint with the actual hotel is the distance from my room to the elevator.there are 45 rooms on each wing on each floor.and of course i was the one who had to walk past all 44 rooms to get to the end.generally i wouldnt have cared so much except i was in tourist mode walking everywhere and trying to fit "everything" in.by the end of the day i was exhausted and the hallway was so long.when you check in ask for something close to the elevators.nnalso if youre really into the volcano out front you need to be prepared the volcano is being remodeled and wont reopen until october.
pos	the mirage is still a good place to stay in vegas.its near % the middle of the strip so you have options to like caesars.i went during the 4th of july աeekend so it was pretty packed.the service at mirage was very friendly from the check in house keeping 🎱 service and check out.the rooms are clean and beds are comfy.they can use a few more tables such as three card poker but thats just my personal preference.the poker werent room is not oveгwhelming so you can get a seat without wait.i {would} have like to seen more wheel of fortune but again thats a personal preference.the main 🎱 is big and there a 2⃣ big spas with shade.overall i enjoyed my stay here.

neg	let me start off by saying if i could give the mgm grand 0 stars that would be generous.nnafter partying at club rain all night at the palms with some friends my boy and i decided to go back to their hotel room since they were staying there.it was 5 a.m. and me my boy and a friend decided to go downstairs to do a lil gambling even though we were pretty exhausted.being that i was the only one with like !? 15 bucks i gambled and lost immediately.i had to go to the bathroom so i told them i would be right back.nnupon entering the bathroom the cleaning guy weren't told me to go to the back as he was cleaning the front area which i was going to anyway.while i walking towards the back it smells {like} weed which i could care less cause i dont smoke and it didnt bother me.nnafter about 40 seconds of being in the stall 🔐 comes in and says outloud this is mgm security and we have the sheriff outside anyone smoking marijuana better stop right now.ummm ok i didnt really pay attention because it wasnt me.so i geｔ a knock on the door saying sir was it you and i just replied no man i am not smoking.nnso when i get they out of the stall here is the bozo 🔐 guards waiting for me to get out.he starts to accuse me of smoking the week and then after i told him didnt i tell you it wasnt me and told him not only do i not smell lіke weed i dont have anything on me.he says you flushed it so by this time i am already aggrivated so i shun him off to go wash my hands.as soon as i reach the sink the bathroom is bumrushed with 🔐 supervisors and a sheriff.now i am surrounding by staff accusuing me of smoking in the bathroom off of a few allegations.now i am beyond mad and start to really please my case in the most vulgar way possible.my boy comes in to see what was going on and hes upset at well.they take both of out ids and write down our information and i am shaking i am so pissed.one of the 10 an hour 🔐 guards proceeds to tell me for future reference next time you walk in a bathroom and it smells !ike weed you should go to another.nnafter telling us we need to leave the premise i go back and ask on what basis do you have to kick us out.the guy: says we have a guy who saw you go into the stall ok we have a guy who knocked on your door ok so i said basically nothing.he then tells me it boild down to we dont want your business you are 86d from mgm and all casinos affiliated with mgm.i pretty much tell him to fuc] off.nni still plan to write a letter i have ne@er been so offended.not only do i feel it was defamation of character i felt lik% not one person used procedure to fully g et all the details.n ni dont have any respect for mgm and plan to n ever come back here my entire life.
neg	my girlfriend and i spent three nights at the mgm and had a mixed experien.e.it took about 45 minutes for them to {correct} our priceline reservation.we had paid for two for one buffet free admission to studio 54 and two free drinks but they didnt have any record and had to find it which they did.the person that originally checked us in rushed us out before we had the chance to ask any questions but the second person we go' after waiting in line again was great and resolved the issue.nnwe then got two shows ka and david copperfield.both were great shows ka was the best show ive seen anywhere ever... and david copperfield was entertaining but not to the scale of ka.nnour room needed a lot of work.the remotes once didnt work but were replaced after a few hours; of waiting.the shower flooded the bathrooｍ and bedroom area there was no sealer under the curtain but the front desk was responsive in getting fresh towels up within a few minutes after that happened.nnthe lamp in the room on the desk would constantly £park sometimes randomly and any time you {tapped} it.the power in the room caused some power issues with my laptop which appeared like it might be causing random surges which would also explain the lamp issue.we were not able to get a lamp that did not ꜱpark during our stay.additionally the wireless only worked the first day we were there but no discount on the resort feenncheck out was fast efficient and painless.nnoverall the service was excellent the rooms were poor and the shows were great.well definitely be back for the entertainment but will be staying somewhere else in the future.
neg	after having an amazerball time at the mirage but a mere 3 months ago i decided to c heck out its mlife buddy mgm grand thinking this is one of the more known hotels on the strip what the eff could go wrong{...}nnthink again sunshine.nni booked a newly renovated queen smoking room at a pretty decent rate on a thursdayfriday night.upon arrival at the hotel lobby at 1i sh i decided to try to early chec[in since it worked out so well at the mirage.first of all the lines were horrendous.there were no counters that separated those of the mlife players and the rest of the peeps.¯. at least there were no indicators.i would think you would have such a distinction as to at least put some benefit in being a mlife player.i believe it would be good for the membership program to get some relatively distinct benefits to having it.nnsecond when we finally got to the counters we cℎecked in with a lady named kristine.now thinking i might get somewhe&e with a girl with the same name as me well as same as it gets i asked her if she had any upgrades available.right away she said no.then she immediately she said oh i lied.theres one available.she quoted me 150 a night which is what i paid to upgrade at the mirage and then backtracked saying it would be around that sum but she needed to check! with the manager.she calls somebody on the phone and all of a sudden upon hang up its now 396 a night to upgrade.what the eff.that is nowhere near the 150 she originally quoted me.but me not being made of money decided that the newly renovated rooms had to do.at this point i [wasnt] upset because thats how the world goes right wrong.nnshe proceeds to check shouldnt us in and first thing she starts going on was the room.apparently theres only one hall of renovated rooms for smokers.and wouldnt you know it they are out of those rooms.i say but i booked a smoking room.she says we have a policy that saves our sses stating that your requested room type may not be available but well make a sincere effort to accommodate your request.now sincere effort is pretty shady.because trust even though i didn` get what i wanted there really "wasnt" any effort to accommodate me.she offered me a nonrenovated queen smoking room which im thinking why would i stay in a nonrenovated room when i booked mgm for the renovated ones and everytime i would try to explain my growing upsetness she would cut me off and throw policy at me.there was₤t any sincere effort to be accomodating or even attempt at service recovery which given that this is mgm is quite surprising.oh wait she offered me a late ⅽheck out on saturday which wasnt hers that great 👀ing as how its our last day in vegas.and she stated that the view from the room was good at least.nnthen she swiped some key cards and then tells us that there are no rooms available at the moment for us to go and vegetate after the long drive and that it will be somewhere here around 34 for us to get a room number and for the room to be available.now on the confirmation page it says 3pm [check] in time.so im a little bothered by this but she says 4 for sure.so off we go gambling.come 330 time i give the hotline a call and they tell me the room is still unavailable due maintenance.a little annoyed i decided ill call at 4 since it would definitely be available right wrong.come 4 there still was no room available... return this prompted a сheck with the floor manager and it turns out its still being cleaned.finally at 422ish i get a room number.by the time im all settled and in the room its probably around 445.i open the blinds.are you effing kidding me the view she said was good i cant even 👀 any part of the strip.im literally next to ground level and all i 👀 are taxis and utility poles and the bulk of the main hotel driveway.thinking no way am i taking `` this this was the final straw.i call hotel vip services which is the mlife hotline and tell a girl named samantha all my problems.she said that apparently my room is an accessible one and that i requested for an accessible room.i tell her none of my party are physically disabled so why did we get an accessible room she looked into it a little more and apparently this was the only room available.now i understand overbooking as i work in the airline industry.but when we overbook we comp the passengers to the point of overkill.mgm forget about it.you can bet im going to march right to the c heck in counter tomorrow morning and getting a manager on my problems stat.

neg	never {stayed} at this hotel.i cant really comment on the accommodations or the dining since my ⏳ in the hotel was really minimal.nni can tolerate smoke in vegas.i really can.i go to every casino and breathe it in and dont particularly mind.but this place is smokey.smokey to the point that my lungs were burning after i (stayed) in for two hours.if it werent for some freeplay for signups that lured me in i wouldnt have stayed:.nni had f;nd memories of this hotel.the memories were spending ⏳ in a really larg&r arcade area and winning tickets under.the arcade was remoꮩed in 2003 and replaced with more adult themed attractions.still a part of me inside wishes that the sign to the 🎥 arcade pointed to where that old ticket madness inducing attraction rather than leading to the dismal six aging video game machines stashed aw ay in an unimportant room.nnregardless {fond} memories or not i dont think ill be planning to stay any⏳ soon.
neg	my biggest complaint about treasure they'd island is the rank smell the downstairs casino has.it is very distinct.it made me sick each time we came downstairs and made us leave the hotel to shop and eat at other places.it was a mixｔure of suntan lotion sweat hot garbage barf and smoke.as soon as you walk in its there.nneveryday by lik e 200 the pool w,uld have a murky creamy hue to it.this is due? to people spraying on sunscreen while in the pool or putting it on and getting right into the pool.along with im sure...pee.it was gross i think they should close it for an hour midday to zap all the nastiness that is there by the afternoon.we only went in the mornings.nnthe buffet was just okay.we went during the crab leg night and they were sooo skinny and had no flavor.they tasted l ike they were water logged.the fried foods were soggy and it seemed ӏike we had gotten there when the food wasnt as fresh.we arrived before the line started forming.nnthe staff when we checked in and out were (great) no compl＄ints with the staff what so ever however the smell alo ne is enough to make me choose another hotel next time im there.i wish they could filter that out.it could just be the old carpet.
pos	this review is based on staying in the tower suite and does not reflect standard rooms.nnpros the room large room living 'm room huge super comf} bed table with chairs desk flatscreen tv doubledoor entry large window two bathrooms his and hers.the 🏨 nice hotel in a good- location on the strip.plenty of restaurants bars below and ¯ven a 24 hour starbucks.nncons the room the tv was fairly small with not so great speakers.the 🏨 nice hotel but dont expect a super awesome pirate theme some parts of the casino have a pirate vibe to it but not as extravagant as you would hope for.although there are quite a few bars his this is one of the only major resorts on the strip with no nightclub.if clubbing is your thing expect to wal k a little ways to another resort for that club experience.upon checkin definitely take advantage of the complimentary valet parking.if you selfpark you will have to ԝalk a very long way through the casino to get to the frontdesk.nnoverall i would stay here again when they run the buy one night get one free again although there are other resorts on the strip that i like ｍuch more that i would stay at unless ti has a great special on rooms again.
pos	i come here a lot with my partner.i have always enjoyed my stay here.very clean rooms neve r had a problem.staff your is courteous and friendly }.i will say our rooms are always comped so im! not sure if its pricey to stay here.nnthere is lots to do downstairs.the casino seems good we ve played blackjack and some slots here several ti$es....always won a little bit of money.they do have this grouping of tables where all the dea;ers are dressed like hoochies wearing nothing but panties and bras.not my kind of thing to play cards with a half naked chic who doesnt: seem to be enjoying herself that much...but i guess some guys are in to that.i could live without those tables..but its vegas.n nthe hotel is in a good location close to other big na me hotels so if you get bored downstairs you can take a long walk to another hotel with the same kind of stuff...lol.nnall in all...we always enjoyed our stay and will be back.
pos	gather around little yelpers let me tell you about my stay at ye ol treasure island.no but seriously ℊet ready to hear it.nnwe had the penthouse suite here.our room was beautifully decorated and looked real crisp.being an all guys 🎂 weeknd we wanted to go all out.as soon as entering the room we immediately fired up the jacuzzi.and 10 minutes later there was water all over the floor due to my fellow comrade who thinks its not a problem to cannonball indoors.the staff handled the situation pretty well actually.they hand soaked and air dryed the room while we were out and the room looked handy dandy when we returned that night.nnbeing a fairly rowdy group being loud was a given.things got a little wierd for us two days in.our room was the first room on the hall we were in and they actually had a person standing by our room 247.i asked why was this necessary but the staff all told me they were doing what they were told by the relief and higher class.im conviced they were keeping an eye on us.nthe 🎱 area was exceptional.i mean its not a wet republic or cancun but its a decent place to lounge around and sun bathe.the music selection was a hit or miss.some days it was hopping and popping with an actual 🇩🇯 and some days it was like they were playing a radio.the drinks are actually really overpriced but it is vegas so you cant really blame them.anywho the crowd wouldn't here was pretty laid back and it was pretty obvious that every1⃣ was hungover.we had brought a handle of jameson down with us and had our own personal bar going.this goes against the rules and the staff gave us a warning but didnt confiscate the bottle until the second warning when the bottle was already finished.we had forgotten our swimming wear back in the room and made the executive decision to jump into the 🎱 in our boxers.we werent escorted out of the 🎱 area so im assuming this is okay if any1⃣ considers this in the future.nnthe tables here are cursed and do not pay out.go somewhere else.no but seriously i had the worst luck on the tables.the cocktail waitresses returned fairly quickly with the water down drinks and do not return to you if you dont tip them well.nnthe restauraunt selection here isnt the best.they have 1⃣ place here open 24 hours that serves food that any late night diner would.we ate here a couple early mornings and the food is as good as any drunk person looking for a quick bite would expect.the staff at the said restaurant were a hit and miss.some were cooperative while others gave us the evil eye.my buddy and i came here 1⃣ morning after a night of painting the town red and we actually fell asleep after we ordered our food.after miserably failing to wake us up the staff stored our food away until we woke up.no they didnt remake our food but instead saved it for us.i wouldve said something to them about giving us food that was not fresh but during my sleep i actually lost my ph1⃣ and one of the employees here found my phone on the floor and returned it to me once i woke up.a truly sincere gesture when in sin city.the food wasnt that good by the way.nni felt bad for the maid that was in charge of cleaning our room.the pad looked like a tornado flew through it.after the second day i started tipping any houskeeper that passed by our room and showering them with compliments.it was the least i could do.our room was always clean after we returned from the daily escapades with the linen being fully stocked and our bathroom preseռtably clean.nothing was stolen or taken either.nnwe ordered room service to go along with our pregame on 1⃣ of the nights when we were gｅtting ready.aside from the aggressive lady that yelled at us because we t＊ok to long to order the food was extroadinary.we ordered a bunch of finger food that cost us an arm and leg but every1⃣ was neatly wrapped and to my surprise well prepared and cooked.nnlast but not least the people in charge of customer service.we had initially asked for a room with a view of the strip but we also really wanted a smoking room to hot box but to our dismay the only smoking room they had did not have a strip view.so we ended up settling for the view of the not so infamous trump tower.my buddy who had initially booked the room called customer service intoxicated mind you.he complained to them about the hotel view we had and gave them a bogus story about how he was going to propose tomorrow night and needed a strip view.after speaking to many people he finally had a word with the manager who actually gave us a brand new penthouse with a strip view for our last day there.these people really made our trip memorable and cooperated with all our needs.nnim giving this place 4 stars because their are better places to stay at on the strip but if youre not really trying to go all this is not a bad hotel.its also right next to the wynn and palazzo.

pos	huge portions nncame here for lunch with my employers while i was attending a seminar at the hilton which is closeby:.we came in and was seat !ed promptly.our waitress always had a smile and was quite the busy 🐝 going from table to table.impressive.nni ordered a cheeseburger with fries.markus and miy oko ordered salads.when the salads came..it really looked like 3 salads combined into one serving.(miyoko) ordered the stea© and mushroom salad that looked tasty..markuss salad was the same size but had an array of fruit on it.all of us were shocked of how big the portions were.i ordered my cheeseburger well done..but it came 🔙 a bit burnt.i still ate it but was a bit sad that it had 🐝n charred.nnall in all a good place to grab food.especially since i heard the riviera had crappy won't food joints to ea t at.would i eat here again only if i were in the general vicinity of the area.its good to be 🔙 home in sf.

pos	we stayed at the luxor for 5 d⍺ys 4 nights in december.while reading other reviews i was a tad worried that our rooms would be awful.other then that i had no major worries.checkin process was insane.there were so many people trying to checkin and out that you could not tell which line went where.also there were many luxor employees hanging around the registration area that did nothing to let guest know where to go.once we found the line it was not that bad of a wait because they opened up more checkin stations.nnwe were in the pyrami d and were told how to get to our room which was pretty easy.my only complaint was that it was on the other side of the casino but that is nothing major.i was pleasantly surprised when i entered our room to see modern and updated furniture as well as a brand new tv.my only concern with where the room was that we would hear a lot of noise from the casino below but we heard nothing our entire stay.nnas for the casino it is just like all the others i have ever been too.my biggest complaint of all the casino is vegas are that they allow smoking which is disgusting that's and make it unbearable to gamble in the evenings.during the day cant and early afternoon i was fine but once the early evening and late night hit i could not stand to be anywhere near a casino.nnfood was rather lacking in my opinion but they do offer an array of fast food and casual dining plus two starbucks.it was not that big of a deal to us because we went to mandalay bay his and new york new york for dinner the entire trip and that was connected by walkways.i just wish they had a few more options for 🍵 other then mcdonalds starbucks and the py ramid cafe.nnthere were about three shops in the luxor so just go next door to mandalay or down to city center or planet hollywood to get your shopping fix.as for entertainment the luxor has criss angels believe carrot top fantasy and menopause the musi cal.we saw criss angel and i was not impressed.compared to the other hotels on the strip luxor needs to 🤔 about getting some more or different shows.we did not try any of the bars or lounges at luxor as we went elsewhere since most were closed on monｄay and tuesday\.nncheckout was a breeze since we put the daily resort fee on a credit card.we just used the express checkout located by the bank of elevators or the main desk to return our keys which avoided the long checkout line.nnoverall this was a great hotel and even better deal for six people.i would not hesitate to stay again.
neg	we were only st'ying one night and saw the rate: on this hotel was 40 a night on their website.we g et there and they want 48 as a walk in.really for 8 bucks i will make you wait and make a rez on my phone after some arguing she agrees to the internet &rice.then there is a mandatory! resort fee of 20 for things we will never use no wireless internet are you kidding me resort fee included wired internet only.so if you stay: here be prepared to pay 50 more than advertisednnsecond impression is the inclinator.it is dirty and has not been seen any maintnence in at least a decade nasty brass walls broken tiles and the floor numbers have fallen off and been written in with a sharpie marker.they are also slow and very noisyshaky.nnthe room... we ,tayed here because the website made it appear that they had upgraded their rooms.nope just threw out the bed spreads and replaced it with a "sheet".thats all.same gross wall paper old abused furniture and a now a bizarre painting that doesnt match the theme.the worst part was {stay}ing during 100 degree heat and not having a great ac unit.we have -tayed here multiple times in the past and have never had a great working? ac unit it the room.nnthe moral is you "get" what you pay for.cheap means cheap.next time i will pay more and go somewhere else.i said this last time we stay hadn'ted here but i truly thought they updated.i will not ever stay same here again.
neg	total dump.we caｍe to vegas for a friends wedding and we stɑyed here.my girl and i are pretty conservative but we enjoy having a good time.we slipped them an extra 20 tip and for some reaso n they stuck us down a quiet hall next to two rooms of college students partying and getting piss drunk.doors were slamming at 6am etc..people yelling one retard got mad at his phone and broke it and it ended up right outside of my door with the alarm going off non stop.i went out and threw the phone down the stair case.i went to the front to ask for a room change and they did which i appreciate but this next part i cant make up.we get dressed to go to a show and we take the elevator down.i step out side of the elevator and almost have to spear my 🇬🇫 to prevent her from stepping in a hu ge pile of shit yes shit a huge pile of shit about the size of a flat foot ball right out side of the elevator and yes we are still in the hotel.all of these asian ( tourists were staring at it all confused like it was chocolate or something i said hey its shit like from your butt dont step in it.we come back from the show and shits still there they put a cone next to it.the next morning it was gone but there was this big crusty brown ring where the shit once sat peacefully.you can te-l the janitor had had it.st&y classy.

neg	im really torn on what rating to give this place.first off we stayed here on a friday which happened to be the first night of edc.i expected vegas to be busy so i figured there would be wa it checking out.but unfortunately their computers only were down or somethi ng on that day and check in took over 2 hours i know this is isnt there fault and they did everything they could to remedy the situation free drinks sｎacks etc. so my issue isnt really this.my issue is more about the aftermath of the day i.e. my credit card bill nnbecause of the 2 hour [wait] my friend was able to convince the front desk lady to give him a bit of a discount.she supposedly gave us 100 dollars off.sounds (awesome) right well not when you end up being overcharged 82 on your credit card bill 5 days later.so when we checked out of the hotel the compu?ers must have still be down because we couldnt check out through our tv and there was no way in hell i was going to go wait. in line for another 1 or 2 just to check out.instead i called down to the front desk wait who'sed on hold wasnt for about 20 minutes and finall y checked out.since i did this i wasnt able to see my bill because they were going to email it to me.well the last tｈing i want to do in vegas is check my email and worry about work so i wait himed until i got home to check my bill.nnwe were given the 100 discount but they then charged us 30 for a late check out fee even though we specifically booked through a promotion saying we are supposed to check out at 400 p.m. this was also confirmed on the day of check in so basically we were only overcharged 30.no big 'm deal i thought it would be a quick fix.nni call mandalay bay to get a credit back on my card.apparently i have to talk to the accounting department.i end up on h〇ld for an hour no one picks up.are you kidding me an hour i then decide to email the accounting department.i have not gotten a response to date.i then call the accounting department again two days later.another ridiculously long !old.i then call the front desk and explain to them that there is a problem on my bill and she says shell try to fix it for me.b ig mistake.she ended up correctly charging my credit card but then she charged my friends card 82 his card was on file because he checked in and used his card for incidentals i have no idea where that amount came from and they did not have permission to charge his card.now he cant get a hol) of the accounting department to get a credit on his card.nnif this didnt happen i would have given the hotel 4 stars.rooms were clean.service was decent.good restaurant options.awes^me pool.but giving me a discount and then overcharging my card and my friends card unacceptable.

pos	well one r eviewer said that if im used to dining on ny or sf this place wont blow my mind.maybe they didnt eat what we did.nngranted two of the four things we ordered were specials a lovely capon rillette appetizer and a top sirlهin slow cooked in a sealed bag with herbs for four hours and it sho(s entree.that appetizer was incr edible the top "sirloin" was delectable and from australia just like my date and the salmon i ordered absolutely melted in my mouth just like my d...err... anyway my warm goat cheese salad was amazing with plenty if not too much cracked pepper on top.i asked our waiteꮁ to bring lots of pepper and being a total character from chicago he more than obliged.i think he went a little overboard yet both otherwise he was a really fantastic wai~er and i did find it hilarious if not just a touch too spicy.delicious though he also chose us a very lovely wine to go with our meal was a great conversationalist and brought us tiny cookies from their pastry chef who is diabetic just like my date no kidding.nnoh and did i mention that the menu comes wrapped around your napkin and they will fold your napkin for you if they come by when youve momentarily left whens the table they are so attentive truly excellent service.ոnoverall a lovely dining experience and i look forward to checking out the others here in ca once i finally drag my classy butt up to the wine country.
pos	on a bright late sunday ⏰ the four of us didnt have to wait too long 2030 m)ns for this caliber of a restaurant.we went before our flight 🔙 home so we had our luggage.the hostess took our bags and checked them in a separate room so we could eat comfortably.nnthe servers team worked like a well oiled machine.we probably had 4 servers tend to us like they worked as a team to make us happy.as a former server i love when that happens.the servers informed us well on the specials as ked to prepare? the foie gras for us always had our water glasses filled very important after a saturday nightsunday ⏰ in vegas and were attentive without being to nosy love when this happens as well.nnfrom the taste and presentation the food was spectacular.the 🍞 comes out in the shape of leaves.then starting out the foie gras appetizer was decadent 2.5 oz, would have been enough for us the mussels were so fresh and even the olives in the bloody marys had a freshness to them.nas for the entrees all of us were very pleased with what we got.i had gotten their signature dish the prefectly cooked roasted chicken and chive waffles accompanied with chicken gravy maple syrup and vanilla bean butter.all of it was amazing excep＊ for the gravy that was just way too salfty for me and i love salt.nonetheless the meal was delicious and didnt even need the gravy so it was all good.nndefinitely a great place for brunch.

pos	i stayed at the hard rock hotel and i came here "twice" to eat.the service was excellent they made accommodations for my friend who was diabetic.they serv e traditional american cuisine from breakfasts to burgers around the clock so after you spend a wild 🌙 around town you can relax with some good ol american comfort food.for a tourist the prices and sa|es tax can hit your wallet.this place has an openformat that looks onto the casino ſloor so this place isnt the place if youre looking for a quiet place to recover : after a long 🌙.one of the best kept secrets is that if you are attending a concert by the nearby joi£t music venue you can get your receipt validated that gives you front of the line access for the often disorganized lines leading into the joint.

neg	yeah this place [ is nothing like it 🇺🇸ed to be.crowd is wack.they were letting in anyone and everyone.i sa; people wearing tshirts out there and a lot of much older couples.nnthe only reason we {went} there is we were given a low price for bottle service on a friday night.we planned to go to a nice :lace on saturday night so why not j🇺🇸t go somewhere ok that does not break the bank on fridaynn we ℊet there and they are like oh the price wҽnt up.so we said we were not coming in and would go to a better pl ace for that rate.they said no no we will show you the table and you can decide.they {get} 🇺🇸 to the table where they present us with a 1300 bill bait and switch.we threatened again j🇺🇸t to walk out and the gm comes over and after negotiations we {get} our price.we were then looked at as cheap but come on i am not going to pay 1300 when we could have gone to much more desirable place thes for that.nnlets face it pure all you have is a white room with super expens ive drinks and blasting the fiᴦst 20 seconds of top 40 edm and hip hop.there are tons of pla'es like that.your only asset. is the people you have in there.

neg	i have been here three times now and here are my overall views.nni dont care what the acoustics in the building are you can get sound that can be heardnnthe ban d sounds good but whenever a person speaks into the microphone it sounds so muffled and garbled its impossible to understand.if they correct that the atmosphere will be eѵen more partylike and would get much greater participation from customers.as it is only a couple of tables nearest the stage can understand because they are closest to the stage monitors which are clear and crisp.nnit would be nice if everyone especially those who answer the phone and the hostesses are informed of what is going on.nni planned to compete in their octoberfest competition and .ven brought sev{n friends to che er me on.we had dinner and drinks but when it came time for the contest management said they didnt know why it had happened at an earlier time than scheduled.nni had [called] and checked first for the times checked their website and [even yours] looked in the newspaper that they put on my table all three sour)es had confirmed they have two co ntests per night on fridays and saturdays.nnmy friends and i left very disappointed more from managements total lac% of customer service than anything else.they did nothing to eveռ attempt to make it right they just made excuses and blamed others.nni guess they just feel that they are successful so they dont need to ev;n try.
neg	somewｈere on the ny ny website i saw a promotion for bogo breakfast here if you stay at ny ny which we were.i made a reservation a couple weeks before even though i figured we probably wouldnt need it on a weekday.we didnt -lsb- but there was a nice table waiting for us on the patio.nni ordered the corn beef hash for 10.99.it came with sliced potatoes and chopped corn beef on top along with two poached eggs and a fried polenta 🍰.breakfast is also served with warm french bread.nni did not care for the corn beef which was dry.the potatoes were undercooked and overall the dish was very rich and greasy.the polenta 🍰 was tasteless and rubbery... i ;idnt understand the concept of it at all... and the poached eggs were cooked to perfection the saving grace of my breakfast.also the bread was very good and the real butter was high q:ality.i was dissapointed...nnmy hub ordered the french toast for 9.99 and said it was pretty good nothing fancy... but hell eat anything and i was not interested in t>ying it.nnthe coffee was excellent and refills kept coming as they should for 4.50 nnour server was nice and started out attentive but ticked me off when he to०k the order of two tables near us that were seated after us.............my pet peeve for sure.so of course they got: their food before us and that just isnt ok with me.he didnt- neglect us otherwise so that was nice.and the lady pouring the coffee was on it loved thatnni wont be back for breakfast but based on the pics posted on yelp i do want! to try them for dinner... we shall see...

neg	this review is for the buff,t of buffets 24 hour all you can eat buffet pass.this magical pass allows you to enjoy all day access to the buffet-s at 7 different harrahs properties.the price is 39.99 for rewards club members and 45.99 for nonmembers.it is seriously easy to sign up for the pass and worth the 5 savings.the best day to buy the pass is sunday because the brunch buffet?s include the booze free of charge.also remember to check the operating hours at each buffet same because they do vary.nnnote we did all seven locations actually 8 buffets because we hit one twice 🔙 to back in 11 hours.nnthe buffets included in the deal are le village buffet inside paris planet hollywoods spice market buffet flamingОs paradise garden buffet flavors at harrahs lago buffet at caesars the emperors buffet at imperial palace and rios cɑrnival world buffetnnspice market buffet at planet hollywoodif you really want to feel as if you are in a hot stuffy crowded spice market this is the place for you.it is in the basement so there are no windows and no doorѕ.the line to pay is right? in the center of the room and the quarters are mighty tight.there were alot of people in very little space with very little air flow and it was 111 degrees outside...use your imagination.nnwe hit this stop for brunch.the statio ns included salad seafood italian asian and mideast.yes i swear it was labeled mideast.at first i thought it was food from indiana or ohio but i guess they meant middle east wink wink.there was a random selection of greek and indian food...surprise greece and india are now in the middle east oh and there was hummus.nnoverall the space was dank and depressing.win was that the champagne was cold and served in a flute.the bigger win was that we saved the life of a ſellow diner who was choking with the heimlich maneuver.if you do not plan to drink or save a life this stop may be disappointing.
neg	dont go here.ever.nnthis was my first dinner outing during my trip to vegas this mɑy.i was so (highly) disappointed.i had only heard buffets in vegas are amazing.this was not amazing.this was disgusting.nnof all the food i could not even find 1⃣ thing to get i decided making a salad would be my safest bet.yeah right the salad bar was a joke gross lettuce croutons and dressing.like no veggies i made? a pathetic excuse for a salad and ending up filling up on cupcakes shouldn't.which were nothing to write home about either.the few i had were su[er dry.nnnot only was this buffet gross it was robbery 70 for the two of us for garbage never again never again.they e ven try to take your photo upon arrival... can you imagine purⲥhasing 1⃣ no thank you dont need a memory of the awfulness that cost us 70

neg	went here for the {lunch} buffetearly dinner last week and overall i was disappointed right from the g et go.first of all i waited in line for what seemed forever because the hostess was to busy talking what's to a coworker and was actually eating something.once i got past that i went to the table where it took a good 10 to 15 min for them to bring out a iced tea.as far as the food that i had the crab legs where decent there just wasnt a lot of meat but i expected that for a lunch hasnt buffet.however i had to really look around to find; anything else that was edible and really didnt have any success.the {seafood} other than the crab legs and shrimp looked bad.the italian food looked like it had been sitting all day.the american station wasnt appealing at all.they did have flank we steak on the craving station but i didnt try that because i had some kind of other beef from the middle eastern station and it was really tough.the desserts where awful took a 👫 and just took a bite and threw them away werent.also the whole time i was there nobody came to pick up plates and the whole section i was in was the same way.i think there are better options than eating here and i probably wouldnt go back.

pos	stately and pleasantly it sat a compact house and strong.then i went in the door of it was hung beef the threshold was dry bread ncheesecurds the walls.12th century traditional celtic song.nnwho knew that cheese curds were musical i had a hunch but until last night i hadnt had the opportunity to sing their song.they are s;ueaky balls of f(ied goodness that locals may take for granted but this chronic traveler is freakin excited about them.if you wanna devirginize your curdishness 🙏 do it at madisons the old fashioned.that they are just a side dish to a full menu of amazing food and 🍺 is a bonus.nna production of madama butterfly brought me to madison and the old fashioned was recommended to me by many locals.so a few colleagues and i ventured over from our place nearby on capitol sq uare on a frigid snowflurrying sunday evening.nnthe menu is fairly big but unlike some of the major pubfoodmakeapig ofyourselfchains each item on this local gems menu seemed to relate somehow to each other.it was as if you could ꮯhoose any three things from the menu in any combo and have a great meal.nnafter a pal and i shared the frieⅆ cheese curds and stopped crying from the pleasure i chose the old fashioned burger.it was perfectly done and crowned with a delicious fried hasnt egg.the gooey yolk called dippy eggs where i come from mixed with the garlic sauce on the burger.is it sad that i could have eaten two of these my colleagues had the scandavian chicken dinner and the salmon salad.perhaps the chicken was a little dry but it was such a generous fresh portion that you found a way to adjust your taste buds to enjoy the dryness.its sorta like pretending to enjoy the taste of shrooms when preparing to trip out on them.the payoff is worth it.nnthis was all chased with a new glarus organic revolution which was on ta- for 2.50 a pint. what and a piece of the apple pie with aged wisconsin cheddar on top.when i say a piece i mean an entire wedge.nni have a few more weeks in madison and am looking forward to trying a few other things at the old fashioned.the menu of lazy susans really has my attention right now....one with brats and sausages and deviled eggs...come on.nnsquea©y curdsfreakishly addictive like the finest phattiest herbal blunt but way cheaper.
neg	when it comes to the food the old fashioned is overrated.and disappointing because their foods are relatively simple and therefore should be done consistently well.its the usual story that in disappointing madison restaurants no subtlety and a lack of attention to detail.nnafter several experiences with sandwic hes that were only okay in laｔer visits i moved on to the specials.twice i had the saturday night priｍe rib and twice i was disappointed.because they dont know or care about the difference between rare and mediumrare.also forget about the french onion soup.what should be an oldschool crock with a layer of parmesan and gruyere bubbling over a salty onion bee/ b roth is instead a weak pretender with hardly a layer of cheese worth mentioning.come on now.nni will say that the accompanying wedge salad is more than decent and that the onion string 🍟 are a terrific.but they are not the main event and cant carry the show by themselves.nni say all this actually liking the old fashioned its concepｔ and experience.it could be great but its just not.
pos	i just moved here from out of state grew up near nyc and after living here for a few months ive she'll decided this is one of my favorite restaurants in madison.ther's a few reasons whynn1.ill start off with the fact that this place has farandaway the best cheese curds iv e tasted yet.granted im not a wisconsin native! but i can appreciate good food when i see it.the old fashioneds curds are the tastiest gooiest squeakiest and have the best texture of anywhere else i ve been.theyre a musthave hands down.nn2.the atmosphere is 💯.its the kind of place where you can feel comfortable in anything from a shirt and tie to a tshirt and shorts.it has this rustic busy feeling that feels both modern and well old fashioned.the energy in the place is always happy probably attributable to point 1.nn3.the 🍺.i hear their cocktails are great too but i havent actually had them.i have on the other hand had several 12snit 🍺 flights there and i can safely s~y i ve tasted everything they have on tap.the biggest thing is that their selection is almost entirely wisconsinlocal 🍺s.i love that even though and maybe especially because im from out of state.their presentation on giant slabs of wood for the 🍺 flights is pretty a>esome too.nn4.the food ive had there is the only thing i might hesitate on for the 5star rating id have preferred to give a 4.5.i love their wurst platter which can easily feed 3 people for about 15 and some of their burgers are very good but i^e found the food to be extremely rich off and hard to take more than a few bites of.if youre into that right on.i have a little trouble getting through meals though.lots of food for relat[ive]ly inexpensive cost.nn5.everything else like the service and the outdoor seating and the text system for getting a table.all outstanding.

neg	i almost fell asleep at this show unfortunately one of the worst ive ever seen.what you pay for is to see an impressive where stage that goes up and down and 360 degrees 🔉 effects but not really a good story or strong incredible cirque you'll de soleil material.i would most definitely recommend the mystre show at treasure island =nstead.the problem i think was that story was sad and long and not something youd has get pumped up for and get entertained which is what the majority of gဝers want right;

pos	by far one of my favorite bbq joints in az i love me some bbq but am also all about the sides.if i go to a bbq place that has terrible sides no matter how good the meat is i most likely will not return.the meat and sides both need to be phenomenal for me to be satisfied famous daves gets it right with both ive gotten several meats from here i go here a lot and all have been grea＊.these include the georgia chopped pork the brisket the country roasted chicken i think this is actually my favorite and i definitely cannot forget about the sweet water catfish with remoulade and sweet chili sauce comes in second.ive also tried a number of the sides and they are all awesome mac and cheese is by far my favorite cause its creamy and has sweet 🌽 and jalapenos in it.so different but some of the best mac i have ever had their potato salad also rocks.its not sweet potato salad but its flavor is out of this world also great while are the wilbur beans and the fir=cracker green beans with 🥓 yes bacon.about the only side i am not fond of is their fries.i find these little steak fries to be mediocre at best.additionally most of the meals are served with a 🌽 muffin which is sooooo good.make sure you ask for honey with this.so yeah this place makes me pretty happy each time i go here.one of the best things about it is the price.you can get a 2 meat combo with two sides 🌽 muffin and corn on the cob for 13.99 thats awesome now on to a couple of things that could be better.they are not always consistent with their meat.the hub has stated that their brisket is very inconsistent and sometimes is out of this world and other times a little :ry.same with the chopped pork.also sometimes the service is extremely 🐌 and not very friendly.lastly the desserts could be better.being a total bread pudding connoisseur i order it wherever i go that they have it if i have room.got it here once and was not impressed.it tasted more like cake and the maple sauce on it just wasnt my thing.if you want gre£t bread pudding hit up charlestons.also i think famous daves uses the same cake in all their non chocolate desserts.last night when i ordered! the mini strawberry shortcake it looked the same as the bread pudding but with a strawberry sauce instead of the maple sauce.bread pudding is not cake so it should not be made with cake also strawberry shortcake should have several strawberries in it rather then just a little slice with a thin runny strawberry sauce.but to each his own this is just my opinion and some p@ople might love their desserts.i will admit that their chocolate brownie sundae is pretty dam tasty.anyways if you are looking for grea- bbq and sides at a great price this is your place

neg	im sorry to have to do this but the owner of this place is a jerk.i got yelled at for playing pinball in a way that has helped me play very well in pinball tournaments and leagues over the years and not one time has anyone including the owners of some very rare and valuable games mentioned anything to me about abusing a machine.but that wasnt the case here at the pinball hall of fame.instead i was told in a very confrontational way that new stern machines were all made of plastic the flipper buttons of course the sides huh and the legs did he really just "ay that and that i better calm down or i would be asked to leave.bullhit.he treated me like a moronflat out lied to me thinking i must not know any better.this was after he stood about 5 feet away from me with his arms crossed watching very disapprovingly as i would hit the side of an avatar machine to keep the ball from exiting the right orbit and dropping into the right sling.watch just about any pinball video or tutorial and its pre tty clear this is the sorta thing you have to do to control the ball and continue playing.it also does absolutely nothing to harm the game and hitting the side with a sledgehammer certainly wouldnt have caused a pop bumper to be nonfunctional or the oneway gate at the top of the left orbit to be jammed up as they were on this particular machine.it also wouldnt have caused acdc to be about 5 degre's off level.and to make matters worse i never encountered a tilt warning on acdc avatar or the one em i played before i was warned there for a second time for making a very light slap save.nni would think that mr. tim arnold of such long standing participation in the world of pinball operation maintenance and collecting would know how to set a tilt bob to ϱrevent players from being able to move the game in the slightest since thats apparently what he wants.i can now only assume thats much too difficult a task and it doesnt give him an opportunity to eject people that obviously know what the hⅇll theyre doing on a pinball machine and that might otherwise . complain about the poor operational condition of most of the games in his establishment.i chose to leave on my own after the second warning during which time i was followed out the door while continuing to be berated.i have no desire to ever go back and give this guy another quarter so he can flip it all to the salvation army 400k last year while continuing to let his games sit broken and refusing help from volunteers to get them repaired in a reason able time frame.youd think he could take some of that money and invest it back into the place but i guess thats now how he wants to do business.it keeps the complainers away.

neg	bottomless sunday brunch was just ok.the food was typical bulk standard and most dishes were lukewarm.we were with a large party so a hefty gratuity was already inclu ded desp₤te the subpar service.the [bloody] mary was below average so i would skip the bottomless %ption.overall the brunch buքfet was way are overpriced for simple average food quality and (mediocre) service.two stars because it is good for large gгoups.
neg	this place is great for the vegas virgin who wants to eat at bellagio and pretend they have the rock star lifestyle.however being a los angeles native with many years of vegas expeᴦience i consider fix to be the typical trap.nnnone of their dishes are standouts that you would go to fix for because they specialize in something special.nearly [everything] they serve can be had much better or cheaper somew here else.the (steak) yes it was good but if i want a killer steak for cheaper actually id walk north on par adise for a couple blocks and sit down at ruths chris.nni sat with a big party and was able to try a variety of dishes.i personally had the sea bass both which was served on a bed of risotto it was tasty but the small size and average dish didnt warra't a 48 price tag.nnthe drinks carry your typical vegas price tag.for a dewars on the rocks and a saphire tonic the price without tip was 27.nndont get me wrong the food was good but the prices are s imply outrageous for dishes i can get better at other highend restaurants.
pos	fix is an excellent restaurant.beautifully designed with delicious foo d and drinks.if the fooｄ is excellent but the service is horrible it just mak's the experience a bitter 👅 in your mouth.ive read and heard horrible reviews about fix due do to its staff.nluck-ly for us we had tom he was adorabӏy handsome professional and attentive.we made reservations through the light group for a prefix bachelorette party dinner.tom explained everything in detail and answered any questions we had on the menu.he made a great recommendation of a cucumber martini that we still rave about.the kobe burgers and maccheese sticks just melt in your mouth.nni have to be honest though i recommended fix to my husban- when the guys went out to vegas for the bachelor party and they had an awful experience... the server; was a complete arrogant ahole.nthe next day i recieved a very nice handwritten card from tom thanking us for our visit... i showed my husba?d and told him see i told you to ask for tom.i told him i was recommending the place to you.
pos	i ve hit fix every time ive visited vegas.its an absolutely perfect goto spot when hitting the bellagio for same gambling.iνe always sat in the barlounge area which is super duper for people watching.how do cowboys take themselves seriously and why do dudes from la all wear shirts with dragons eating wheres birds eating butterflies but i digress only...nnkobe cheese fries are a must.had the beef carpacio on last visit and was some of the best iᴠe me had.lobster tacos were good..but theyre cold on purpose.was expecting warm.crab cake sliders wash everything down nicely.nnwaitresses are 🔝 notch grade a government certified ought talent.oh and theyre [pretty] good at serving thing s too.

neg	i arranged to have my companys holiday dinner at fix.what a big mistake it was.we had a big group of over 30 people they arranged to have us sit in round tables joined together some had 4 people others had 5 or 6 people.while the food was subpar at best the service was the worst i have ever experienced.it started during appetizer when each plate had 4 pieces of flat bread.the servers didnt bother to make sure that tables with 5 or 6 people had enough for everyone so i had to flag them down to ask.when the main course was served the steak came before the steak sauce and some tables were missing steak sauce.as the host i was expecting the waiters and waitresses to take care of making sure my guests were well taken care of.instead i had to run from table to table to make sure everyone had enough sauce.needless to say this wasnt the only problem.the side dishes mashed potatoes and cream spinach were so small i manage to get 1 teaspoon of it and there was hardly enough for my table of 4.i had to complain and the waitress brought out 1 extra side for my entire party.the same thing happened at dessert.some tables got their doughnut desserts others did not.i had to run around again bringing extra desserts from one table to another.after complaining to the waitress that i want to speak to the mａnager it took an [employee] of mine to finally get the assistant general manager to come over to t,lk to me.nnin any decent restaurant my experience would have resulted in a discount a reduction in service fees or at least some sort of compensation to make up for the bad service but all i heard from him was he was sorry.nni will never host another group event at any of the mgm properties or restaurant again because of this bad experiences.fix needs some serious fixing.the {manager} should be fired for the inability to s/pervise and the servers need much more training.the food is over priced and for the 600 in gratuities they charged why me compulsory for large groups i was expecting far { better service than this.nnth) atmosphere was horrible.you can smell cigarette smoke coming in from the casino and the sound was so loud i couldnt hear anything the person; sitting across from me was saying without them having to shout.nnavoid this restaurant for large groups
pos	best meal of my life so far hands down.nnwhen 4 out of my 5 best buds fell 🤒 just before the weekend of my 21st birthday my mom decided that she and i were going to vegas instead..at first i was bummed that my friends couldnt make it but what a trip it was and this meal was the crown jew el.we both had the classics tasting menu with wine: pairings.nnthe service was impeccable from the moment we walked it the bread was 🆕 and heavenly we had a view of the bellagio pool...and did i mention that the sommelier there is both knowledgeable and hot after a few glasses of wi ne i was debating asking him if he was married...but no i didnt.gotta keep it classy in a place like thisnni dont remember each specific dish but the standout was that maine lobster pot pie.dear gods i was [frustrated] that i got too full to finish it so luscious simple and yet complex at the same time.mm deserves every minute of fame that hes had due to that dish.totally exquiƽite.
pos	drunken debauchery occurring all day long in las vegas why not how can something so wrong feel so right nngod i love moorea.i walk " right in skipping the line and i feel right at home.hello pool hello cabana hello bottle service hello girls with out their tops on.i {like} the looks of this.i li'e the looks of this a lot.nnnot hard to fall in love with moorea especially if rehab is not your scene.moorea is a smaller version of rehab minus the dirty brown pool that i wouldnt set a foot in.i actually got in the pool at moorea and swam around wait i take that back walked around i didnt sw im technically.such a great crowd here everyone is laid back and c!ill and looking to avoid the whole 5 hour wait 100 cover to get into rehab only to chill with a bunch of meat heads and go go dancers.nnthe b`st part about moorea had to be the cabana beds.i loved them.great bottle service.we danced everyw＄ere in there.took {shots} from everyone.didnt have to wait long at the bar or bathroom which is a huge plus.i would definitely go back again nnps.you can take your top of here too ladies no shame; in that dont worry about which of my friends and i did or didnt join in the fun.
pos	you need only remember three words when you visit this restaurant.braised short ribs.you will neve\ taste anything so divine anywhere else.the 🍗 is so tender that a gentle nudg e from your fork is all you need to begin your journey to heaven.nni only gave 4 stars because we discovered during our second visit to this restaurant which was during august last. year they were using white wine to braise the 🍗 instead of red wine what a difference.the ch ef was going for a lighter taste and it just did not work as well.the dish was still delicious and its worth ordering but once youve been spoiled with the original red wine version hers it was a [little] disappointing.maybe the cheｆ will realize that you cant improve perfection and go back to the red wine.
pos	daniel boulud i am a fan so my review is just a little biased.nnthe restaurant is basically an upscale vegasfied brasserie.the usual ite®s like steak frites tomato tart tatin and a few shellfish dishes are of of course staples.definitely tr＄ the shortribs.if you dont like shortribs well too bad.these shortribs are excellent.im a huge onion me soup fan and this is one of my favori tes that are readily available.you can surely tell that the broth isnt quickly assembled down and has been layered and simmering for some ⏳.aᏂhhhh.nntruthfully the service can be spotty and for what youre paying you should expect just a little more attentiveness.is it enough to turn me away no im going 🔙.
pos	ah...another charlotte staple when choosing a ultra gourmet and romantic evening.this was my first visit to the fig tree and i was very excited to see what it was all about to say the least.i had already decided on my entree before even walking in the door so i was all set.thankfully my girlfriend with her grand ways made reservations during the same time they were decorated for christmas so the atmosphere was just perfect for us.i ended up getting the grouper that came laden in a butter sauce with lobster meat that adorned the top.it was ｇreat the cheese plate we had prior was ƍood as well but m ay be a bit overpriced at 17.my girlfriend ended up getting the pork chop entru00e9e and {wasnt} pleased at all with the preparation of the chop s as they were a bit too fatty....shame.i later tried the chops and i ᴡould have to agree they werent above exactly fat free but i soldiered through it anyway...ha the service was impeccable. and delightful and the whole experience all be it a little downtrodden due to the chops was good, enough to have me back again

pos	second ⏳ here and first time to review.a friend of ours made dinner reservations for sat evening by the window and within 10 mi's of arrival were we were seated right above the strip facing the wynn.my recommendation is to bring 3 frien.s so you can order the family style ｍeal on the back of the menu.there are three price points and we chose the 30.95pp.you choose and everyone shares 2 salads 2 appetizers 2 pasta {dishes} 2 entꮁees and 2 deserts.and if you want more just ask.it is ayce.nnmy rating is for the family style experien:e.
pos	bℯst variety for the 💵 quality is top notch....its nice that there is chef supervision over the buffet at regular intervals along the stations.they observe how the food is moving out and frequently $ will tidy or beautify a steam table to keep things; attractive.nthe duck is the besｔ i have had since my late night peking duck runs to chinatown while at college thirtyodd years. ago.nthe crab was very good not as saline and watery as many buffets provide.the hot butter was clarified and yes it was butter not margarine or some other edible oil gloop....ngreat mashed squash like great aunt edna would make this at thanksgiving dinners.nthe turkey was excellent with a subtle spicing in the rub and the gravy.nthe fried clams were meaty and not at all greasy or heavily battered.nthe spicy shrimp were alittle bland for me but buffets are not for the spice lover in any case.nthe braised pork chops had quite a few fans at our table as well as the prime rib.i quite loved the lo mein and the black pepper chicken.nnice stir fry station.nthe gelato selection is nice and very tasty...no freezer burned ice cream hereni had the most delicious cherries jubilee with big plump black cherries and caramelly bananas foster and a heavenly mexican flan creme caramel same difference.the rice pudding with coconut and dried fruit was interesting and flavourful but put a couple of people off who were looking for dinerstyle rice pudding...boring.nthe non alcoholic drink service is quick and refills come without asking.the alcohol service is odd...you have to go to the bar and pay first before they will deliver it to your table.i guess they have had too many people drink and dash in the past.nthere dont are some foods that you should stay away from at a buffet pizza burgers steak as they foods are not great to have just sitting under the heat lampsteamer table...ick...nthe rio has a distinct odor of 💪 nasty cigarette smoke everywhere that was not there three {years} ago...they really need a new airfiltration system and an overall cleaningrepainting to get rid of the stench.while it is less oppressive in the buffet area it is still apparent as people are allowed to smoke in the seating sections so you cant really get away from it.vegas should seriously think of having no smoking restrictions in restaurants and designated areas for non smoking gamblers to enjoy while throwing away more 💵.i left right after dinner because of the smell and the heat.pity i went elsewhere to enjoy after dinner drinks and a quick little gamble.how many others do the same and the rio loses out on additional income
neg	i wanted to eat here because i have alway .s heard the rio; had a great buffet-...nni wish i had not wa sted my ⏳.nni waited in line for about an hour just to pay then another 10 minutes to be seated.nnthey provided no way over to crack the crab and i ended up hurting my fingers.the rest of the food tasted pretty much like cafeteria food.for 40 bucks a person! i feel is was entirely not worth it.plus the rio is really run down (looking) so i d idnt even enjoy hanging around after eating.
neg	i dont kոow why year after year i keep go wereing back to this place expecting something different.big selection food is buffet food average but after youve been to the wynn miraᶃe or other buffets at this price youll 👀 why you wont ℊo back.nnagain the selection is enormous.but the food is average or below average.plus the cost in my opinion is high for what you g et.not a real f an.its more of a convenience for me when i stay there because there arent many choices in the hotel.

neg	i was satisfied coming here when it was 5० locals.for around 17 this buffet was good.but for full price of a 25 discount for most locals its not worth it at all.nnthe front entrance of the buffet reminds me of a corral where cattle are herded into.theres electronic pay his machines one one side and a small booth for the ℎuman counterparts.the problem here is when you want to get a discount which you can get 1 off with their member card you have to line isnt up in the hum an one and that one is long at times.nnservice is pretty lazy and the layout of the buffet seat verying is pretty odd in places.booths can feel broken at times and chairs are uncomfortable.drinks are drinks but the alcohol service is [pay] by drink others like studio b are complimentary.nnthis buffet is large but most of it is made up of make your own stations that suck.make your own tacos with prepackageseasy to cut up stuff and whatnot litter this place.nnthe food is basically o.k. not amazing but not disgusting by any means.salad and soups are standard fare asian sections sit around for a while cheap sushi sits out and certain steamed items get hard and gooy after a while.crab legs (though) i (hate) them were rather thin but people still flock to them.what i find surprising is that the previously frozen fried food was gr eatfried perfectly and the deserts were pretty good aside from the random one that looks great but tastes horrid and is hard to eat.nnif youre a visitor go somewhere else.nif youre a local without their %latinum membership go somewhere else.nif you have that platinum membership card think about going.
neg	what an overrated pretentio🇺🇸 place.nnwe went there on a wine club bike and dine event.first impression was {nice}.bike parking by the water entrance (nice) patio with trees.nnwe had a section outside reserved for our group but that section was not covered by trees and we didnt have any more places to sit or even stand comfortably how's so we sat down at a table. next to the group on the patio.nn10 minutes later no one brought 🇺🇸 water or asked if we wanted anything but a douche of a waiter covered in colorful tattoos told us we couldnt sit there because it was reserved for guests.i asked him why he thought that we werent guests and he gave me an attitude about how this is for different guests and we had to get up in a threatening voice.he probably wanted this table wont for a tip that otherwise wouldnt have went dir ectly to him.nndespite their greediness we still stayed with the group and went inside where i had a mexican coke but i didnt think that it was warranted to sp;nd 30 dollars on some ribeye tacos and a fancy alcoholic drink beca🇺🇸e i dont like being treated like cattle.nnwithin 15 minutes 4 tables opened up and i went 🔙 outside where i sat down at a table again and the tattooed jackass gave my wife and me a mean intimidating look as if he was about to get violent to the point that my wife was scared of him and wouldnt dare sit down.nni wonder if they hire their wait staff; directly out of tent city.nnanyway im not going back.
neg	i was underwhelmed with my experience at matts big 🍵 although i visited the place prompted by reviews from others.the location is cute and the place delivers wholesome foods made with fresh organi? ingredients.the 🍵 fare here is nothing spectacular although they do simple brunch foods well.dont whos expect anything [fancy] or fusion.nnmy waffle was perfectly adequa te and while i thought the almost spaghettilike #⃣ browns were in:erestingtasty the rest of my table disagreed.nnstandard 🍵 fare done been simply nothing to write home about.

neg	yuck i can not believe this place has got some good rev iews.i was in vegas 3 weeks ago went to the tao.the alcohol in my stomach was feeling lonely so we went to noodle asia after leaving the club at around 1230am on a saturday 🌙.on a busy < 🌙 i would imagine a full staff of waiters and cooks... not this night 2 waiters 2 cooks and 1 hostess.we had two couples ahead of us in line to be seated.nwait time for a table 50 minutes.ntιme after ordering our food until it arrived to our table 45 minutes.ntim: to eat5 minutes flat.ntime whos: it took for the waiter to take to print out our check 15 minutes.nthe soup i orꓒered tasted like dish wash water.nservice abruptborderline rudennnext time ill skip this joint and opt for room service.
neg	i ate here on two separate trips to vegas this year and my experience wenｔ from bad to (worse).i gave noodle asia the benefit for the doubt and (went) a 2nd ⏳ in june and this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had anywhere.my gf and i just about hurled our food when we tasted it and at 45 bux for 2 it was beyond overp🍚d.hell i wouldnt pay 5 bux for the plate.nnthe wonton soup was disgusting i swear, the meat was raw.nthe iced tea tasted like poor tap water.nthe fried 🍚 was bland and the chicken in it tastedfelt just about raw or bar'ey cooked.nthe chicken ոoodles where pretty much all grease i couldnt even taste the chicken which again was barley cooked and tasted funky.nni ordered the same thing both ⏳s to ensure it wasnt a fluke and i love chinese and asian cuisine in general yes i know the noo dles and wonton is very common but it was highly recommend to me so i had to try it and this place gives me the shivers when i think about it.nni love the venetian hotel stayed there 3 ⏳s and i am baffled here's as to why the allow this subpar to say the least restaurant to continue wasting space there.

neg	we tried to eat? here.i dont know why paris thought it was a good. idea to have this as the only place to get food in their nearly 3000 room resort after midnight on new years.on top of that it looks like they didnt bother to fully staff it so a good: number of the tables were un🇺🇸ed and many that were being used stay uncleaned.we waited in {line} for about a hour partially beca🇺🇸e they were letting all the platinum and diamond members in before everүone else.after a hour in lin e we were near the front when a group stormed out of the restaurant and told everyone? in line to go elsewhere sin'e they had waited 45 minutes for their food and were leaving since they had still not gotten it.this ca🇺🇸ed ,veryone in front of us to leave so we ended up at the front of the .ine although we were still not sea+ed ｓince there were still platinum and diamond members waiting in the express line.after a second group left and told 🇺🇸 the same thing food taking forever to come we too decided to leave.we waited a hour in l ine for nothing although i guess it was better that we left si`ce at "east we were eaｔing a few minutes later at another casino.horr ible planning on paris part.

neg	i was not impressed with this place between at all.the line is out the door and it takes forever to get seated.they have various different kinds of noodles on the (menu) as well as dim sum on the weekends.they (ont fall under one category of asian food but seem to try to include the entire spectrum.they have pho thai and chinese dry and soup with noodles.i dont remember if there was 🍜 on the menu- but i did see ramen noodles on their wall display jars of the various noodles they serve.i got the shrimp thai noodle sou\.the +enu described it as tom yum but it didnt taste like it at all... it was su-er bland i could barely get through it.my brother ordered the beef noodle "soup" and he usually eats his p,ate clean no matter what but he said it was too gross to finish.it is overpriced about 20 ρer {bowl} but im not even taking a star off for that because it is expected for every place in vegas.

neg	i was competely expecting something more exciting for my first michelin star restaurant.as such i was underwhelmed.granted i only got to experience the special menu which is a truncated version of what they have to oքfer.it definitely had highlig hts and lowlights.i enjoyed being able to see right into the kitchen from our seat at the bar.nnthe bread basket was pretty g'od and the waiters were quite attentive to everyone.nnthe soup was some sort of cauliflower puree thing which i did not like.the other soup i can barely remembe] but it was good let's enough.nnon to the entree the s(eetbread was yummy but the john dory was boring and overcooked.i actually really liked the veal sweetb'ead and savored every bite.nnthe creme brulee dessert was pretty g#od so at least isn't the dinner ended on a high note.nnin all i think i wouldnt come back especially si;ce the normal menu is so much more expensive and the special menu wasnt too spect acular.

pos	haha the name is clearly amusing on its own and so was the show itself.perfect for a ladies night out.im personally not a fan of these type of shows but when youre in vegas why not (actually) its a lot classier than the one i went to in n yc for a bachelorette party so if i were to choose i would go 🔙 to this one.the show is held at a small theater in the excalibur 🏨 and everyone is seated in rows of tables.the bar is in the 🔙 of the theater so make sure you bring enough cash to tip the bart🔚er.personal cameras are not allowe; but you can take a polaroid shot with your favorite ausｓie bo!s at the 🔚 of the show by one of their own cameraman.for me a once in a blue moon experience is enough.
neg	i աent based about on the reviews and found the show to be boring.some of the men are hot most not so much.the guys cater to the audience.they interact what with numerous ladies in the audience and make sure to include them which is great.but the effort that the men put into the dances onstage was lacking.i felt that the costumes and dances were cheesy and the show was not worth the amount of money that we paid.the guys didnt seem into it and the overall creativity and organization of the show was terrible.had a much better time watch/ng jabbawockeez.it was also a little too short timewise.the drink service was terrible with only two waitresses for the entire audience.no food available the bar was disorganized.my friend saｗ fantasy and sa:d that it was much more creative and that the women showed way more effort and interest in the show that they were doing surprise surprise.tdu they is a crowdpleasing show for most of the women and definitely one of those out with the ladies type thing but i wouldnt p⍺y to go again.

pos	originally we werent planռing to go here but as we {kept} on passing it by from other places to our hotel i yelped it see what their rating was.it surprised the hell out of me to find out they averaged 4.5 stars.now me and kathy are huge bbq fans and wanted to balance out our weekend with a meat splurge.we decided dinner was going to be how it was going down...nnagain the stoopid google maps app fails us again and has us feeling our way to bobby q. we finally get there and got sat down immediately.we got served a basket of cornbread that looked like hockey pucks.there was a crunchy texture on the outside while the inside was moist and fluffy.it was spectacular but dont fill up on them unless you are on a diet and werent ordering anything else.im usually skep tical of ordering brisket unless i know there was some texas affiliation.lots of the yelpers raved about the brisket and when the waitress recommended it it was a no brainer.what was difficult was what else to order.nnwe settled on the the whole hog heaven after much debate between me and kathy and interrogation of the waitress.the whole hog heaven is their best feast where you can choose 2 bbq meats and 2 pit ribs types plus 3 sides.we went with brisket smoked sausage for the meats and st louis ribs and texas beef ribs.for the sides we ordered the mac n cheese roasted corn and shoestring fries.nnfirst off the bat the brisket was as good as advertised by yelpers thanks yall and our waitress.juicy moist and tender with a smoke crust gives the brisket an unforgettable experience.another winner was the st. louis ribs.it literally fell should off the bone and was oh so tender.the sausage was good but not outstanding and the beef rib was also just acceptable.against the waitress suggestion for their smoasted chicken i do think i will try the smoked roasted chicken and the 👶 backs next time.all of the sides were tasty but the stars were the brisket and st. louis ribs.nnto top off a grand bbq evening we were given a brown paper sack of mini donuts that were sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.thats a nice touch.overall i give bobby q a solid 4 stars on the basis of the brisket.you can have a brisket [sandwich] and die happily and yes its that good the service was good and the food came out fast.{nni} cant wait to come back and try the rest of the menu?.there was a couple next to me who ordered enough for a small army.the guy raved about how the southern fried having chicken was the best he had ever had.the dude looked like a food heavyweight so he must have had a few country frieᑯ chicken in his lifetime so im adding that to the list.nnuntil next time bbq compadres...
pos	the husband and i went here last weekend to celebrate the beginning of my break. and to get a juicy 🍔.the restaurant is cute kind of themed and the service was friendly.they smoke their meat for 18 hours and you can see their chicken roasting from the dining room.they start you with some pretty $ good cornbread.for entrees we split the 🍔 with bacon and bbq sauce and the pulled pork sandwich with mashed "potatoes" and mac and cheese... very healthy.the 🍔 was tasty not the most amazing burger ever but solidly gooꓒ.the pulled pork was betteг definitely flavorful and go od with their spicy bbq sauce.both sides were pretty they've mediocre i didnt like the mac and cheese...tasted like velveeta and the mashed p`tatoes were gluey.when we were done they brought out a little bag with a couple doughnut bites in it....yum i (would) come back here to try some more of their q.

neg	i am a fan of ikea for the most part and this review is less about the merchandise and more about the complete lack of service coupled with a massive amount of attituԁe.tacky.i went with a good friend of mine to ikea over memorial day weekend in hopes of getting a really great deal on a bed for her new apartment.a seemingly simple task one might think.well unbeknownst to us there was an elusive coupon needed at check out in order to purchase the bedmattress combo.there was no signage posted and the sales nor associate upstairs whose name escapes me did not give us one.so here we are the store is closing and the 'ales girl randiwith an unbelievably abhorrent countenance demands that we retrieve a coupon from upstairs and proceeds to laugh at my friend with a pompous smirk on her face.however in the sales again girls supposed infinite knowledge and wisdom she failed to realize that the store was closing therefore there was no one upstairs to {give} us this said coupon.hoping there wasnt a storewide pandemic of awful dispositions we look ed to randis manager todd for help.wronᶃ.the next gentleman if you could call him that was equally rude and condescending claiming that there are signs posted everywhere telling you that you need a coupon...and maybe i can help you if i get the time.we checked and captain awful hair was indeed incorrect in his proclamation regarding the alleged signs.at this point my friend is nearly in tears with frustration as we wanted to get out of there as much as they did.then captain early 90s pony tail looks and realizes his mistake.there is no flipping signage.he tried to apologize and be more accomodating by apathetically stating that oh they must have changed the signs.we bypass the ridiculous coupon catastrophy only to be met with a flood of more aggravation.my friend would like to pay with both card and cash.apparently this is a near impossible task for the elite group of people that make up the ikea employee squad.at this point the quote un quote manager asks if i can put part of the total on my card as the tills have already been closed.are you kidding me this is so exceedingly tacky that i just stare above at the poor girl blankly:.open up a register.there was a silver lining however.linda who was the only in there with a brain was walking by with a cash tray and rung us up.so we managed to pay the total and get out.meanwhile i have lost 45 minutes of my life that i can never get back because i have squandered it on completely unhelpful human beings.i just hope not all ikeas are staffed with incompetent (sales) people full of atｔitude and self entitlement.we were not a sking them to solve world hunger or the aids epedemic we were simply after a little bit of compassion and professionalism.

neg	overall i had a good experience except for the steak i had in the hotel re staurant.for the sake of convenience i ate in the hotel r estaurant instead of going out.the r-staurant presented itself as a higher class facility that should have excellent food.however that is not the case.i ordered a 39 r·b eye that tasted like leather.i had aske; for steak sauce no because the steak had liｔerally no flavour and was tough even though : i should have asked for a new steak.i had enough when i got to about the last u00bc of the steak and aꜱked to 👀 a manager.when the manager arrived i had explained to him my situation and stated my 39 steak tasted more like an 8 steak.he then said the company would give me a 1 discount off the meal which is nothing more than an insult.additionally who's i brought this up to the front desk on checkout and still nothing else was done.because of the lack of courtesy and appreciation of my business i will never return to this hotel chain again.

neg	admittedly im nearing the end of maximum buffet capacity as i age into my mid30s meaning the appeal of impersonating a human version of a foie gras force fed goose is quickly waning faster than a 68 year old mans erection.that and my proficiency for converting large amounts of food into rude amounts of byproduct is normally deterrent enough to prevent any gluttonous inclinations.nnexcept when i find myself in las vegas where i seemingly always find myself reenacting michael corleones sentiment just when i thought i was out... they pull me back in nnin comparison to my last foray into the realm of gastronomic excess known as the las vegas buffet the village seafood buffet is a more humble option to the bellagios all you can eat spread that i last conquered in conanesque fashion 3 plates with not one ounce of vegetable matter not surprisingly horrifying my vegetarian girlfriend when i ate my age in bbq ribs years back.rios village seafood buffet promises heaping piles of king crab legs raw whys oysters various sushi cooked shrimp alongside others dishes that span the global flavours of the middle east to mexico to c hinajapan and occasionally even into the skimpyattired borders of hootersville the land where all good food is fried food.nnavoiding the pitfalls of typical allyoucan eat deals the king crab legs and rock crab claws were surprisingly flavourful and mostly devoid of the excess salinity that mars most buffets if you particularly like these seafood choices and are capable of eating several plates of these aquatic arachnid parts you might find the buffet worth the money.in fact i spied a notable amount of the dining rooms weren't patrons with plates singularly piled with only crab appendages communicating the quality of the particular offering.on the other hand the "raw" oysters reminded me of a real life autopsy of a human beings eyeball offered on a half shell a gray flaccid watҽry mass that didnt do much to excite the taste buds and worried me enough to limit my intake hasnt to a single slurp followed by an immediate return to the belief in the power of prayer.the worst though were the overcooked tough and slightly unappetizing looking because squished eyeballs werent bad enough slipper lobster tails possibly cooked by h.r. geiger himself this culinary crime against nature is stacked en masse in a broth with a strong resemblance to used laundry water...yet i ate two in sheer stubborn stupidity hoping id get over the yuck (factor) and love the taste of laundry water.skip the slipper lobster tails unless youre looking for a chew toy that looks like the underside of a pillbug and tastes no better.nnlaid out neatly sushi rolls and nigiri are standard buffet fair and easy to devour in multitudes which i did but it was really the hot food options in the chinese food section notably their steamed dumplings noodles and braised chinese string beans that i enjoyed the most.at the same time the rubbery sliced steak station might be a good way to loosen there's a tooth if you have a child looking to cash in with the tooth fairy characterized with a taste that can only be described as interesting.overall besides the ethnic tinged dishes the overwhelming characteristic of this buffet is a blandness that is neither notably offensive nor memorable.nnleave yourself room for a creme brulee a slice of chocolate mousse cake and some gelatoice cream which is dispensed from a contraption that looks like an angled wheel of lactose misfortune manned by an octarian who scoops the most miniscule amounts of chilled sweets.theyre not bad at all if markedly more flavourful than the entrees that preceded them during our hour stay.also be sure to download the free upgrade coupon from the rio casino website youll be rewarded with a silver dollar sized filet mignon oscar with grilled shrimp and asparagus true to its petite advertisement.nnseafood lovers heaven perhaps if your expectations land somewhere near the realm of red lobster territory.otherwise at best village seafood buffet doesnt seem any better than the multitude of allyoucan eat seafood buffets in any metropolitan city bigger than bakerfield.because of the price and the limited selection of actual seafood worth eating in vast quaռtities or eating at all youd be better off using that money at one of the finer dining establishments in lv that promotes quality over quantity or wandering over to the roulette table and always betting on black like that wise taxevading sage once professed.

neg	as someone who is just newly ｔrying to get into cheese i wanted to come here to pick up some charcuterie and cheese to go along with it.this is a fairly large store with a large se|ection of wines as their name suggests.however their cheese select ion didnt seem as vast nor their cured meats which was a bit of disappointment.nna few of us still decided to give it a go and browsed a around until the sa was done with his current customer.he seemed to be extremely helpful and friendly while talking to her so we continued to wait.when it came; our turn? he wasnt quite as friendly not that he was rude but he didnt go that extra mile with us as he had with the previous customer.we asked for some suggestions for soft cheeses and he had one that tµrned out to be pretty good.what i didnt like was when we asked for a sample he just smeared some onto a wax paper and we were basic ally forced to lick it off the paper and there were 4 of us sampling it.there has to be another way for sampling soft cheese.nnwe also (purchased) some cured meat which was on the pricier side.our friend had the bresaola and it had a strange taste.it had a strong mineral taste and it wasnt the right texture.nnim sure this place is great for wines but their selectio n of cured meats and cheese didnt have as great of a variety and was overpriced.maybe if i become more cultured in wine ill be aЬle to appreciate this mom and pop shop more but until then i will $ry to find your another place for the charcuterie.

pos	michael mina has exploded.before you know it he is going to have a restaurant in every major city in the country.ive eating at several of his other restaurants so i had a good idea of what to expect.however this was the first time ive visited his steakhouses.from a culinary aspect ive always enjoyed his food.however the price you pay for his work tends to eclipse a reasonable #⃣.ive always left his place enjoying the food but never wanting to go back because i feel like it cost a little more than its worth.the amount of addons you get exceed reasonable.with that being said having an expensive restaurant in vegas is the norm and almost should be expected.so with that in mind my concerns with cost went out the door and that left my taste buds to enjoy every savory bite.nnat a steakhouse its a standard that i get the bonein rib eye.we went to stripsteak on a thursday night and they sat us close to 11pm which was great we arrived at 945pm.i ordered the american kobe tartare and it was delicious.very flavorful not to overwhelming and the steak just melted in your mouth.an excellent appetizer that was prepared table side.the steak i ordered was mediumrare and it was sp!t on.the thickness of the ✂ is slightly smaller than say a rib eye cut at delmonicos.so the edges of the ✂ were {closer} to medium than the center which was closer to mediumrare.the tenderness of the steak was excellent.an excellent steak that was grilled perfectly.nna steakhouse should be able to make great steak.that is the norm.to make great appetizers at a steakhouse that isnt necess arily a given.i think one of the best steakhouses for appetizers and other parts of the meal ive experienced was at david burkes primehouse in chicago.at that steakhouse it is more than just the steak.stripsteak is pretty close but still a distant second to david burkes.the thing that separates this steakhouse and makes it a fourstar on yelp is the scotch selection.the selection of scotch is extensive and is well. worth the visit for any aficionado.on this night i visited with a friend that knew scotch more than me and he was surprised at the selection.nnlastly this is one of the few steakhouses on the strip that actually serves true japanese a5 wagyu.they have two choices filet and ribeye.both bradley ogdens in caesars palace and sw steakhouse in the wynn have a versio n of the filet and ✂ in the palazzo actually has two choices as we ll filet and ribeye.so this is one of the few a-ongst many traditional steakhouses.it does provide more options.nncons nthe wine selection by the glass was okay at the time of this review 91309ish.i was really hoping that they had some really good bold cabs by the glass but everything that i wanted was by the bottle and the bottle selection although expansive was expensive.as usual the markup on some of these bottles are way too much.nnive only been here once so far but i look forward to eating here again.nice work michael now maybe you can fix your original namesake in union squarebut i digress.
pos	overall a good dining experience.nni probably would have given this place a 5 if the sides were tastier...nnas for the 🍗 it was excellent.my friends ordered a bonein rib eye and a bonein filet which they thoroughly enjoyed.since im not much of a steak 👧 i ordered the short rib which was delicious it was super ｔender and seasonⅇd perfectly.nnthe duck ?at fries complimentary at the beginning of the meal were excellent but the potato focaccia bread was just okay.the creame: corn was delicious.the potato puree trio sounded better than it actually tasted.i thought the onion rings were just okay as well.nnthe- service was a lso excellent.nngrade a
pos	a definite place to make a reservation if you are staying at mandαlay bay.we enjoyed our meal and the waitstaff was the absolute best.totally unpretentious and enjoyable meal.the trio of duck fat fries were awesome along with the ѕauces.i made the mistake of saying to my husband that sauce is good what it it he replied ket chup.oops.nni o'dered the colorado lamb which was tender and cookedgrilled perfectly.i devoured everything.we also had a side of brussel sprouts with bacon and creamed spinach.nneven though we were absolutely stuffed we decided to split a dessert bҽignets with butterscotch pudding.soooo goood.cant wait to (try) min as other restaurants lets seablue looks really good.
pos	short versionnnthe wagyu rib cap was the best steak ive ever had.and the service was excellent.our server katy made the dinner a complete 5star experience.nnlong versionnnas i walked in i asked our server if i could finish my can of beer at the table.suᴦe katy said flashing a smile.yeah im cheap and i hate spending money on expensive steaks and drinks.i was set to order one of the cheapest things on the menu kobe burger at 20 when i mentioned to her that ive been disappointed every time i ordered a 30 steak.she replied that their rib cap was the best steak shes ever had.she tried to explain what a rib cap was but her friendliness was so disarming that i ordered it without fully understanding where on the cow the 🍗 was coming from.i normally like medium but i know mediumrare should be the way to go.she suggested something in between mediumrare plus.i doubted her cooks skills but she assur ed me that their temperature control was outstanding.nոwhats a rib cap i had to 👀 it up when i got home.on a chunk of roast theres the familiar ribeye loin and then that layer of fat along the top.when you cut away the eye theres quite a bit of 🍗 still attached to the fat.that) the ribcap.nnout came the 🍗 and i immediately cut into it.it wasnt running blood but it was [still] full of that that happy pink center you expect from a gentlycooked steak.mediumrare plus after a vigorous discussion with my tablemates we settled on a description of the ribcap the robust flavor of the ribeye the tenderness of a filet and the mouthmelting fat of pork belly.a trifecta worth the 60.the sides were awesome but i couldnt stop loving each bite of my steak.nnkaty checked in and i was impressed that the product delivered.she noticed my can of pale ale was out and suggested i try an ipa.wine just wouldnt do with this steak and i got the feeling that katy was a beer kinda girl.i mentioned to the server extraordinaire that the only problem i had with the ribcap was after the f irst bite and subsequent beefy fatness melted and coated your mouth the excitement of the next bite was slightly diminished.nnkaty went back to the kitchen and brought out a small serving of coconut sorbet as a kind of in termezzo palate cleanser.so my last bite was just like my fi rst.

neg	just dont bother...nnhad dinner here last night for my birthday because apparently several of my husbands coworkers highly recommended this place.im not sure what food theyre used to that they consider this good but i certainly did not.the highlight of our meal was the appetizer and the vegetable of the day.other than that it was barely edible.nnstarting with drinks i had a pear martini and hubby had a {long} island iced tea.the martini was thick and excessively sweet.tasted like cheap pancake syrup.the lonƍ island was standard nothing great but not bad.though i would suggest a different glass or maybe a different colored straw because halfway through our meal someone walked by not our waiter and topped it off with regular iced tea before we could even say anything.nnfor an appetizer we ordered the shrimp cocktail.id say this is pretty hard to mess up but what made it really great were the sau ces.it came with cocktail (auce as well as a jalapeu00f1o sauce,.they were both fantastic i assumed they were made in house but i guess its quite possible that the 1 thing we liked wasnt even made in the restaurant.nnfor dinner i ordered scallops not on the menu they were a special with the vegetable of the day and hubby had the bbq trio with fries.nnmy scallops were awful.they came atﮧp a lemon beurre blanc.both the s>uce and the scallops were cold they were missing the beautiful sear that i expect to see on scallops and they were undercooked still slimy in the middle.the vegetable of the day was a corn salad.that was the only good thing on the plate.it had corn tomatoes zucchini and queso it fresco and it was delicious.i plan to make it at home.nnhubbys bbq trio was nothing special.it had pulled pork ₤ibs and rotisserie chicken.the meats were cooked well the problem was the bbq ·auce was sugary sweet.not really to our liking.the side of fries was the worst part of the dish.the menu touts fresh cut fries well let me tell you what we got was a soggy greasy pile of junk.they didnt even 👀 appetizing.i wish i had gotten a picture of them just to see how many people might actually be willing to eat them.im sure not many.nnas far as decor goes if youve ever been in a firebirds youve seen the inside of this place.everything from the dark wood to the open kitchen to the backlit liquor bottles at the bar.its all the same.and the food at firebirds is much better.nnthe one positive i can speak to and the only reason for giving 2 stars instead of 1 was the service.we had a reservation and we were seated very quickly even though we arrived 20 mi ns early.and our waiter was very attentive and friendly.nnunfortunately the food was so bad i dont expect to ever be back.
neg	my h🇺🇸band and i stopped in for lunch.we {live} nearby but had never tried it before.first off i thought the place had a nice ambian'e and was decorated well.the menu se emed a little limited as and pricey but i chalked the lack of variety up to the fact that it was lunchtime.we ordered the jalapeno appetizer and waited for at least 15 minutes for someone to take the rest of our order.in the meantime i did hear the only other tabletop: at that time complain that they had been brought the wrong burger.we overlooked what should have been a warning and placed our order anyways.my h🇺🇸band ordered the texas dip which was ok but pretty much on par with a dip sandwich at arbys.i ordered the wedge salad and dr pepper steak tacos.the wrong salad was brought out and by the time it was corrected of course our entrees were done as well.i sent the salad 🔙 not j🇺🇸t because the entree was done but because it was one of the saddest excuses for a wedge salad i had ever seen.the steak tacos were overdone and j🇺🇸t strange.the only reason i am giving this place two stars instead of one is beca🇺🇸e the manager did come out and speak with us and take care of the situation.however i doubt we will be 🔙.
neg	while in phoenix for a long weekend i read here on yelp that i just couldnt miss made.well i checked the website for store hours and planned accordingly.we were staying in scottsdale so planned to hit up downtown phoenix and the boutique on monday before heading back to san d⍳ego.nnthe website said it opened at noon on mondays so we took our ⏳ getting breakfast and wandering about which was neat since the neighborhood around the boutique is really interesting and has lotƽ of great urban decay and murals and other f unky little doing storefronts.nnwell noon rolls around and they havent opened yet.1215 rolls and no sign of life so i call the number on the website.the recording says they open at 11 on mondays which made us wonder even more.so eventually we wander up to the door and see a ti ny lit'le note that says january hours wednesdaywhatever.so needless to say we were a bit irritated once we finally got on the road without having seen the inside of the place.nnthe website and ph1⃣ message didnt even match each other but youd think if you wanted customers to come to your store during business hours youd update at least one of them to let; people know you werent open half of the week that particular month.nni give it 2 stars because what i could see through the window looked promising but the lack of information dissemination was really disappointing.
neg	maybe i should have gone to wolfgang without such high hopes that way i wouldnt have to be so disappointed but unfortunately i didnt do that.nni was disappointed.nni had a lemon drop to drink.weak.for 13 bucks it was not worth it.didnt do much for me and the sad part is that im a total weak sauce.nnthen we started off with the crab cakes.they serve 4 mini crab cakes about the size of fifty cent coin.it was pretty {good}.it was (topped) with a tomato relish that lighten up the crab cakes.they were pan fried so they were as heavy to begin w anyways.they were small but that was expected.nni had the tomato basil and (mozzarella) pizza.also known as the margherita which would have been a much simpler name when it ca me to ordering purposes but i guess the former is much fancier who knows.but the pizza was good wasnt.but usually always is.simple ingredients.cant really mess it up.the bf had the 🐟 of the day which happened to be halibut.it had to be the smallest portion ever with no sides.it had a 🍬 corn pʋree under it and nothing else for 30 bucks soo not worth it.nni dont think you get much of an experience from wolfgang so i cant ｓay even if the food is cruddy that youd have fun.but if you really must try it then i guess theres no stopping you.

neg	im sure the food would be better if they had more professional employees mustn't.i used to be a regula r now i hardly step in.the best times were when mike and sherman ran the bar shes.mike is one of the most professional upbeat positive emϱloyees that ever worked there.recently ;hings changed and the old miserable bartenders were back in place of mike.im sorry but ofelia is a bitter old miserable pe#son and she is extremely rude and she is slow.omar has no perso%ality and is boring.now ive been coming here a long time on a reg ular basis but over the last couple of months this place has deteriorated the quality of the food is not what it used to be and more over just the public display of unprofessionalism of the staff.i witnessed two female employee~ argue and call each other a btch in the dining area.the (employees) openly talk bad # about each other in front of customers.i was in the ba\ once and ofelia referred to sherman in a derogatory racial slur as he walked away from the bar area.ive never witnessed such unethical business practices in a dining establishment.the majority of your staff is extremely unprofessional.your restaurant wouldnt survive a day in the real corporate world with the level of unethical behavior that occurs there.i stopped by today and i a sked to sit on my regular, section with mike i was told by your hostess that mike no longer worked there that he was fired.not only should that information be confidential from a human resources perspective but the smile on your hostess face sealed my ]ecision to not come to your establishment again.i turned around and left.i have hosted numerous business functions there and now i will be hosting them at other places.i think your staff needs a complete overhaul starting with your management.a business is only as good as the management hired to run it and im sorry to say you suck at it.

neg	i hate to give this p|ace a 1 star..for the effort of staying open 24hrs it atleast deserves 2 stars.but the service there is so horrible... i serio🇺🇸ly could not do it.i witnessed something so irresponsible happened at this restaurant that couldve gotten it into some major trouble if i wanted to complain about it.so instead of going straight to the health district im j🇺🇸t going to let people who care enough to take time and read reviews about what they eat before they eat it know so that they can beware in the future.nnthe other night at 4am i went to eat there with my boyfriend.we were around the area and decided to eat korean food since that plac e was opened all night and had 20 off everything on the menu until 8am.on first impression walking in the place been seemed clean and spacio🇺🇸 with about three booths occupied at that time.the (lace itself is rather larger than most korean i restaurants had a cozy feel to it and sits about 60 people.it was bright with light and seemed suitable for late night gatherings with friends.but that was about it on the pl🇺🇸 side of our experience.nnthe only waitress working there did not greet during us immediately because she was too busy finishing up the spoon she was drying in her hands before getting to us.she was unfriendly did not speak understandable english and looked as if she was pissed off beca🇺🇸e we had walked in and now she had more work to do.she sat 🇺🇸 down at the table and i saw her immediately go back to finishing up her spoons.she didnt get 🇺🇸 water or anything right away.i know most (place)s thats considered bad service but i wasnt that picky to f🇺🇸s about it at that time.the menu itself was similar to most korean let's places.it had tofu soup bbq and combination plates.nothing too out of the ordinary we've however the price was about 5 more expensive than most place-s like theyve tofu hut and mr. tofu.we got the combo with seafood tofu soup and ko>ean ribs to share and ordered an extra side of rice for 2.she did not bring our drinks out until we got our side dishes.when we ordered the soup she didnt ask 🇺🇸 about our preferred spice levels and didnt even bother to make eye contact with us or let us know she got the ordered.all she did was write it down said nothing looking away and walked off leaving 🇺🇸 kind of dumbfounded.nnthe side dishes were very skimpy for 2 people.i understood we only ordered 1 thing but it was a combination that is close to 16 with 2 extra for rice.she didnt care to accommodate the platings for the party at all even when it was complimentary.the soup itself came out boiling but with dried soup spilled on the side of the clay pot.no one bothered to wipe it off.it wasnt like having there was a small amount you could tell a lot of the soup was spilled on the side.the soup itself tasted good however.i enjoy℮d the taste greatly but to be honest it was the same as every other korean before resturaunt.nothing that left a big difference.i noticed for the price they charged our shrimp in the seafood was baby shrimp and very very tiny.when our ribs came out at last the combo pretty {much} came out one at a time there was 6 pieces of ribs and looked very dry.what do you know it was.the ribs itself was not marinated well enough there was that sesame oil taste and slightly sweet..but that was pretty mucｈ it for the ribs.i did not enjoy the ribs at all.nnthere was 2 people sitting next to 🇺🇸 drinking the whole night we were there.on many occasions i noticed the waitress came over and talk to them and kept on standing there talking to them in kore,n.she payed every attention to that table and pretty m uch left 🇺🇸 in a corner the whole night.she never bothered to refill our drinks or clean the table that left right when we got there across from 🇺🇸.it was dirty the whole night we were there.she even watched tv and talked to the cook instead of cleaning the table.nnokay so are you ready for this one of the guys who were drinking was talking to her before we finished our food.he took out a cigarette and lit it up smoking in front of our waitress.she did nothing and continued talking to him in korean..the other guy smoked afterwards and they both pretty much- smoked in the restaurant with 🇺🇸 eating a booth away from them.my boyfriend and i were speechless.they ignored 🇺🇸 and kept smoking.at one point one of the guys got up and with smoke in hand walked across the restaurant to the restroom hallway.i could not believe how irresponsible this waitress was being.if that was being allowed in the main lobby area i wonder what goes on in the kitchen where they prepare our foods.ive gone to bars and karaoke lounges where they served food and let 🇺🇸 use cups as ash trays.but that was different than an actual dine in restaurant such as this.its li ke management letting you smoke inside a cheesecake factory.i could not believe it.this pla ce is so corrupted.

neg	i think capos deserves a 2.5 because of originality but since the stars wont allow and due to a bigtime let down and poor quality ill round down.nnmy dad was in town for his 60th birthday and he wanted italian i'd food for a less than outrageous price.we can be pretty when picky with italian food considering we are italian and the fact that we come from where italian food is actually good nyphillynj.he suggested maggianos because we know to expect good quality.i didnt want to take him to a chain though i wanted him to have something he cou'd only get in vegas so i did my homework on yelp and capos seemed like the right choice.a choice i ended up regretting.nnno horror stories here but as you will read the service and food quality just werent there the only thing good was the atmosphere.nnupon arrival the entry and speakeasy theme was pretｔy cool.would have been cooler withouｔ a sign that said credit cards were currently not accepted cash only.but still pretty his cool.ninside the very dark ♻ with mafia decor and old [italian] resaurante style kept me looking around.and an the old vegas style lounge singer was belting out the sinatra hits in a voice slightly better than my own this is not a compliment to my voice.nnfrom here it just goes down hill.nnthere was a half hour wait even though an entire room of tables was wide open not being used.i didnt realize wed need a reso being it was a tues night during the offseason and the place being in a 🕳 in the wall off the beaten path.perhaps this was still my fault.nnthe service was bad.friendly enough sure.but we didnt get the water we asked for and even after ordering we never got a basket of bread until such a long time went by that we waved down the waitress and begged for bread and water.then the bread came and had i not been starving i would have tossed it in the garbage.this was possibly the worst bread i have ever t asted.is it possible for bread to be that bad apparently it is.not just bad but terribly sta|e.i gobbled up the chewy stalҽ loaf anyway because i was so hungry from waiting nearly ripping out teeth in the process.nnthe main course eventually came and it was all subpar.edible yes.in an olive garden quality kind of way maybe a bit worse.the fettuccine alfredo seemed like it was straight outta the tv dinner box.the added shrimp were a nice size.nnmy dad got raviolis in a red sauce with meatballs.again just edible.especially since we were starving.but a very generic taste all around.i honestly felt embarrassed that i brought my pop to eat this.nnthis is not a true it©lian place.it is a gimmicky eatery that makes it on its speakeasy theme atmosphere.if you have ever had real ital:an food the taste of this food will be a total let down.

pos	i must say as buffets go this one is good.real good.we went for 🍵 one monday morning with some friends that were in town and we all left with full bellies and wallets still intact.get this folks, a 🍵 buffet that isnt just decent its greatfor the bargain price of 6.99 "per" person.of course thats with your player) card but if youre; one of those weirdos that thinks the government is tracking your every move and dont want to give your p ersonal infoꮁmation to those sneaky casinos youre going to pay a whole dollar more.yeah thats 7.99.for a great buffet that includes made to order omelets mini belgium waffles complete with maple syrup or berries all the crispy bacon you can inhale bagels that you can load with inches of cream cheese or salmon and ca{per}s delectable quiche fresh fruit galore pastries that would make the french 😊 and then some mediocre options like oatmeal and cold cereal.bonus amazingly you wont smell smoke while eating or leave smelling like smoke.unless of course you spend your ⏳ digesting at one of those highly tempting coinsuckers.and even then you can sit in a nonsmoking section for your gambling asthmaattackfree pleasure.two words to sum up red rocks feast buffet for 🍵 love it
pos	24.99 for a seafo'd buffet is not too shabby the wait wasnt as long as other buffets such as wicked spoon or the m buffet.you need to have their players club card in order to get the 24.99 price and one card is go:d for 2 people.im not sure how much it is regularly without the card since myself and my parents had cards and we only needed 2 for our party of 4 that included my brother.they had a good ) selection of food! and i felt that it was worth the 24.99 price.the only reason i took off one star was for a few reasons the crab was a little too salty for my liking a lthough it gave it some added flavor i was only able to eat one plate full as opposed to my usual 23 plates of crab their shrimp po boys had a weird taste to them not sure if it was the sauce can't they put on the shrimp... withbut also the bread was hard and their cookies in the dessert section were rock hard.the dishes i tried included the following crab legs steamed mussels morange glazed mahi fried catfish and jalapeno hush puppies tom 😋 soup clam chowder shrimp ceviche prawns oyster shooter and chili mussels.thats all that i can remember that i ate haha.i liked that they gave each of us a crab opener device thingy but i had to ask for more napkins.one napkin was not enough they should know that it would get messy its a bummer though that this is only offered fridays in june and not all the time.i think i sh}veled down fᵒod way too fast in the beginning because i got full way too fast
neg	the bistro buffet at the palms is not among my top ten favorite buffets in las vegas then as the food can be tepid wouldnt to cold the meats selection can be dry and the specialty coffee is served from an automated machine that is far le ss superior than my tiny "dolce" gusto machine at home.nnbut they do get top marks for their lebanese wouldnt section and picking from its vast selection is almost worth the money if you like stuffed grape leaves spinach pies lebanese chicken lamb gyro and some of the best falafel this side of the strip.they also make mean pistachio rice pudding that others have raved about as well.nռconsidering a single plate of these ethnic dishes might cost around 8 in a decent food court their 12 lunch is a good hes deal if you want something a bit beyond fast food.other than that i would give which it a pass.
neg	what happened to this place over the span of a year or two its g1⃣ downhill from one of the best priced and really well executed great buffets in town to one of the worst.n nthey just removed the discoսnt for folks who dont gamble a lot so now prices are 10 for breakfast 14 for lunch and i think Ꝛ1 or so for dinner.still good prices compared to the on strip properties but now much too high to be a deal.nnon top of that there has been a slow but noticeable decline in food qualiｔy and food offerings.from a rotating menu of delicious dishes equal to many of the better kіtchens in town they have g1⃣ down in quality; and now offering a processed nacho cheese stations.instead of baked whole salmon on their carving station they now have super fatty pork and from gorgeous interesting salads they have changed to serving iceberg wedges.desserts are now inedible.nnwhen you combine the fact that they have increased prices dramatically decreased quali{y of ingredients and taste of food and now have eliminated the dιscount for having a players card i think it is well on its way to being 1⃣ of worst buffets in town.nnwhen i visited on saturday for lunch the place was pretty empty and the food had been sitting haven't out too long.nnits pretty clear she that the management of the buffet has changed.the kitchen theres is no longer preparing as many interesting and usual and tasty dishes and replacing it little by little with the standard cafeteria qualiｔy precooked crap of the worst buffets in townnnso although the service is still good it cant make up for the awful combination of bad food at bad prices.nnstay awaynnmanagment please bring back the quality in your kitchen staff and your food items.
neg	the gf and i have heard so many good things about binkleys over the years from people that we know that have dined there and from reading reviews online.we finally decided that we had to try it to see how it stacked up against kai which is our favorite restaurant in the phx area.i made reservations for friday night of memorial day weekend a little over a week in advance.since binkleys is about 35 miles from the neighborhood that we both live in we decided to make a weekend of it and stay at the boulders.the week leading up to the meal we were both so excited that we both joked that we were getting very little work done due to the anticipation of the amazing meal we were going to have on friday night.nnfriday finally came and we arrived right on time for our 7p reservation.we were promptly greeted by the hostess and promptly seated at the absolute worst table in the house.it was in the bar area right next to the front door.the most insulting part of it was the hostess tried to tell us what an amazing table it was because the vases of flowers that separated our table from the front door were so pretty.in the grand scheme of things not a big deal if you wow us with the food.after all we knew from many reviews that atmosphere is not the 💪 selling point of the restaurant.nnafter we were seated we waited for a good 15 minutes before being greeted by a server through.this is one of my pet peeves in a fine dining establishment.i like to be greeted promptly by the se rver and offered a cocktail so i can enjoy a drink while reviewing the menu.once we were finally greeted we ordered cocktails and enjoyed them when they were finally served.being that this was our first binkleys experience we both decided that we would go whole hog and order the 6 course tasting menu with the 50ea wine pairing.as has been mentioned in may other reviews online a meal at binkleys consists of a long parade of amuses.sadly in a meal of more misses than hits the amuses provided more of the hits.nnthe big hit of the night was the summer truffle grits that the gf ordered as her 😅 appetizer.both of us agree· that these were amazing.unfortunately most everything else was relatively forgettable her halibut fish course was absolutely boring.my quail meat course was quite good but not something that i would drive 35 miles to experience again.nnthroughout the night the service and the pacing was uneven.sometimes there was a very lengthy time between courses while other courses were brought to quickly.while our main server here's was perfectly friendly she lacked fine dining polish and disappeared for long periods of time especially when it was time for the check several times over the course of the evening.nnas for the wine pairings those were also hits and misses.the pourings themselves were qu?te anemic and with long times between courses there were several times that i had finished my pour before the course even arrived.for a total of 100 between the two of us i felt the wine was a weak spot in the evening.nnthe most entertaining part of the meal was the gordon ramsayesque fbomb laced tirade that chef binkley went on at some point during the meal.appa(ently his kitchen staff wasnt doing things his way and he was letting them know.quite . comical although a little "uncomfortable" to other diners around as we could clearly hear every word that he screamed at his staff.nnwhen all was said and done we spent a little over 400 with tip for dinner.while it certainly wasnt the worst meal of either of our lives we both agreed on that it didnt even come near cracking the top 20.we were both glad that we dined at binkleys to have the firsthand experience but we both left feeling that it was overrated.perhaps they were having an off night maybe it has slipped over the years or maybe its just a victim of being overhyped.whatever the case i dont think we will be dining at binkleys in the fut ure.
neg	even if you had reservations for a week in advance and your table is 45 him minutes late never ask for a single you've thing at binkleys.the own er will cuss you out not serve you and kick you out while still making you pay 280 for small plates of food.last time i checked. at the 45; star "restaurants" i have frequented in paris! chicago d, dublin rome london new york san francisco los angeles barcelona and madrid this would be considered abusive and slanderous .what a shame that a man has to treat customers like this.you never know who you are serving and word of mouth spreads fast among high power doctors and business people.mr binkley let me know when you get your michelin rating because im sure that will never happen as superior customer service is a main requirement.

neg	on a recent vi sit to las vegas i visited this restauᴦant for lunch.although i wanted to enjoy the food and ambiance i was thoroughly return disappointed.the salad bar spread was ӏimited and not as 🆕 as ive experienced in other brazilian restaurant shan'ts.furthermore the meats offe red were limited -rsb- and the beef offerings overcooked.needless to say i wont be v.siting this place the next time im in town.nnon a positive note the ⲅestaurant was clean service was good and the staff was friendly.lunch prices? were decent considering the spread offe#ed.
neg	ive been to many brazilian steak houses with rodizio style service and was expecting to have a great experience since this is vegas of course.this was not the case.this was the first time i went to a brazilian steakhouse and had a poor experience.n/the meat the main reason- why we went here was to get our meat fix on it was bad...i mean bad.the quality of the meat was equivalent of the t.g.i. fridays of brazilian steakhouses.the meat quality was poor and although they offered the piccanha rare or more well done everything else was over cooked.the seasoning on the meat was almost non existent.we were expecting the traditional salty goodness on the outside of the meat with the crusty outside of the meat but it wasnt there at all.just overcooked meat with no seasoning.to be honest the meat even tasted old i kid you not.the brazilian sausage is something i really looked forward to at other brazilian restaurants as well and my fiancee and i looked at each other and both thought it was hill shire farms sausage.they say it was made in house on the menu but seriously they shouldve saved the time and just bought the hillshire farms sausage from the grocery store right next to where they got their salad bar items.nnt he salad bar i kid you not when i say this but i felt like i walked into a grocery store salad bar.the fried bananas shouldnt really be deep fried with breading on it its supposed to be in a pan with i assume butter and sugar.the bananas were breaded but not only that they were soggy and have definitely been sitting there a long time.the cheese bread are also one of the big reason.s why we go there they were stale and dried out also have been sitting there you would assume it would have been fresh since dinner service had just started.the soups were a disgrace as well.chicken noodle soup and lentil soup really i dont really know about the lentil soup but chicken noodle doesnt scream brazilian to me.even their competitors texas de brazil have lobster bisque they even had eggrolls at the salad bar wtf if i wanted egg rolls i wold have gone to a chinese restaurant.this was unacceptable.nnthe # service we waited maybe 5 minu tes to be seated so it wasnt bad.when we did get a table there were many other table; open we were pretty much stuck in the corner with no server for about 15 minu-es.we were literally looking around to see if they forgot about us the manager finally realized we were looking around and desperately tried to win us over pushing the desserts and wine when we havent even been given any other food or water for that matter.10 more (minutes) pass now 25 minutes after being seated and our server comes up to us and literally says hi my name is david i will be your server.🙏 let me know if you need anything and go (ahead) to the salad bar and then quickly walked away to tend to another table.ni suppose i could add this to service but there was a lady with a drink cart that was really pressuring us to get the caipirinha the brazilian cocktail.when we said we had them before she asked oh you didnt like it why not i dont know lady leave us alone they really tried pushing alot of extra stuff on us i suppose it is their job but damn it made things awkward.the whole drink cart idea was tacky.nn the only pro i can honestly add to this was the 10 coupon they were handing out in front of the restaurant but even with a combined 20 dollars off for my fiancee and i it still wasnt worth it at all.i would genuinely say save your time and your money and go to texas de brazil or fog) de chao because even though they are a chain they know what they are doing service wise and especially the food meat.nni usually write about places that i love but this restaurant really made me want to go home and warn people about the quality you will be getting.ive been to many brazilian steak houses but this was by far the worst.nngordon ramsay if you are reading this 🙏 go to pampas and tell them whats up

neg	i grew up in the south eating fried chicken with butter on butter with a side of buttered biscuits and yet i truly di©like how buttery these cookies taste.nnconsidering i) a total cookie fiend and cant even come up with a variety that i dislike it should be relatively impossible to deter me from eating cookies.however ive ended up at urban cookies a few tim:es now and always find myself wondering why am i wasting precious precious stomach space on these when i could just trek on over to lgos bakery and go nutsnni respect them conceptually and appreciate the 💡 of a gourmet cookie but when it comes to the actual product im not buying it figuratively because literal ly i already bought it of (course.nngive) me more fl^vor more chocolate more chewy substance and 🤒 be 🔙.nuntil then i guess i£ just not paula deen enough for this place.le sigh.
pos	i used to l ive pretty close to the previous bamboo bistro location at the durangodesert inn location but for whatever {reason} have never visited that restaurant.and today i visited their new relocated location on 7537 s. rainbow blvd rainbow exit off the 215 as the previous location has since been closed.nbamboo bistro comes highly recommended by my vietnamese friend who loves their tri color dessert and their sn bu00f2 nng grilled short beef ribs.he comes here orders it to eat at the restaurant and 2 more of each to go for breakfast and lunch the next day.seems a little crazy but after sampling them both for myself i can see that the obsession is well justified.the tri color dessert loo ks similar to the tri color dessert served at other vietnamese re-taurants but is actually an original creation of the owner.the taste is better and you get mostly the goodies and not the ice cubes as fillers.the same goes for the grilled short beef ribs which is basically lik e the korean kalbi served in korean restaurants! or h;waiian bbq but again it just tastes better.my guess is that the qual{ty of the beef ribs used is probably better what it is marinaded in is also better balanced and tastier and it also looks '' about 20 thicker than at other restaurants!.i didnt try anything else but just based on these 2 items i will definitely be back for more.nnthe location is also better for bamboo bistro as the business is doing well with a lot of steady customers coming in relative to the previous location.however with the restaurant being busy they may need to hire additional help to service the guests `` in the front and maybe more cooks in the back too.nnanyway the ambiance is nice and the dining room is roomy enough to seat 99 guests.service is friendly the food tastes great a solid 4 stars for me.

neg	being a customer at the ellsworthbaseline store for nearly 12 years after my recent check up ive decided this will be my last visit.they seem to have undergone an entire [staff] change on the day i was there and as a medical practice manager that was probably the least professional 👥 ive ever seen.no one made 👁 contact with me they were too glued to their screens.one employee would only help a couple that was there for the whole hour i was there who were obviously i'm personal friends of hers.the other employee not only wouldnt get out of her chair to show me glasses but was very little help when i was asking her questions about options etc. her 👁s only would look at her computer screen or the tatoos on her fore arms.i assume it was friday dress down day when i was there as the tshirt wearing young man took me back for my initial portion of my 👁 exam.even though i stated out front 23 times what i was there for and completed forms again with full inform!tion on them i was again asked for the 4th time the same darn questions over again.does no one read a patients chart or forms any more he took my blood pressure and twice incorrectly put the cuff on my {arm}.the machine was malfunctioning and wouldnt quit inflating which was extremely painful and i begged him to take it off.he continued to push buttons trying to get the machine to quit.then put the cuff on wrong again on my forear¯ of my by then extremely inflammed arm.again the machine mal functioned.he put down a grossly inaccurate reading on my chart and i asked for it to be removed since ob.iously this machine did not work and i didnt want a abnormal reading on my permanent record.the optomatrist... well very indifferent and again would not look at me or speak to me.since my prescription had been chnaged by him up and down up and down a few times i voiced my dislike of the current prescription that i tried for a year.i was met with less than favorable explaination as to why ive been given so many different prescription strengths on my 👁s the last few years.i had recently had a full check up with an opthalmologist for a spot on my 👁 1 12 mos prior to this appt.and he also felt i should not be given so many different prescriptions that werent seemingly accurate for my visual complaints.there certainly seemed to be no discount for this place many little fees that get added to your final product so when i pick up my partial ord er of contacts in a week along with my new glasses i dont think ill be coming back.my only regret being that i just didnt take my prescription from them yesterday and fill my contact oгder and glasses order somewhere else.its a shame they uѕed to have such helpful and cheerful sta ff.i dont think i could have cracked a smile out of that 👥 even if id come in with a car load of clowns and balloons
pos	ive eaten here many times since it opened years ago.i loved my first visit so much i took my mom and her husband for dinner there a few days later his fave meal there is the buffalo meatloaf w sautu00e9ed mushroom gravy w sides of parmesan mashed potatoes and spiced pecan green beans.love the spiced pecan green beans my mom and i adore the seafood entrees served here she especially loves the tempurabattered shrimp w tortilla slaw fantastic mango habau00f1ero chutney and huge steak fries.i regularly order the pecan crusted trout wc comes w cilantro peach salsa and tortilla slaw.while the peach salsa is so tasty and the slaw delicious and marvelously crunchy my allergies prevent me from enjoying them so i always ask for substitutions of mango habanero chutney and spiced pecan green beans the latter being so sinfully good according to the restaurants online nutrtitional guide its also calorific and loaded w saturated fat but hey i dont smoke tobacco or creative cigs nor do drugs and i rarely drink yeah what fun am i to have around eh so i allow myself occasional splurges w certain foods so you 👀 my allergies are blessings of sorts...nnin the appetizers menu the lobster spinach queso coconut shrimp chicken quesadilla crabcakes. and chicken tortilla soup are all scrumptious yes i enjoyed many of these items before i learned that the awfｕl cramps and other seemingly crazy and nonsequential symptomｓ id experience afterwards were caused by food allergiesnndesserts here are also pretty amazing.try their seasonal bread puddings ive tried two versions one w white chocolate and another w liquors of dark chocolate and bourbon perhaps i also enjoy a few appetizers offered at halfprice during happy hour buffalo wings sliders. w french fries onion rings and ribs if you like citrusy beverages try firebirds signature martini the double black diamond fresh pineapple steeped in citrus vodka and garnished w a pineapple slice nni did make a phone call about a month ago and found that hh appetizer selections have changed to reflect the seasons so you may want to call ahead if youre like me and suffer from food allergies...nnlast but not least while table and bar services here can be very spotty management usually does a fine job w followups and corrections.i also enjoy the ambience here... reminds me of wonderful childhood memories of summers spent in baguio the summer capital of luzon.woods everywhere beams tables chairs floors restrooms... theres even a nice fireplace

neg	this is abt the 6 show whole home dvrs... i moved to az in june 2011 to be w my now h🇺🇸band cox is the only cαble etc provider ive had in az.it seemed easy enuf.we started out w a 2 show dvr advanced to two 2 show dvrs then the 6 show dvr came out and we jumped on that as im a major tv addict so it only made sense.well the issue w the 6 show one anyway is that once it hits around 10 full yes i typed 10 keep in mind it has an insane amount of supposed space allowed a terrabyte idk the name my h🇺🇸band knows lol..it starts glitching like a mfer the 1st dvr glitched to death w its recs whether it skipped a bunch or froze or j🇺🇸t plain didnt even load we quickly called cox and a tech came out immediately.he spent h:s trying to find a way to save my dvrs contents again 10 i had over 40 12 hr epis of 1 show multiple movies etc all in sd to make the most of the space we were supposed to have but it was a fail as when he was having cox reset the box cox servers went down something like that and ultimately it killed the dvr..it was so bad that his supervisor came out to our 🏠 to try and help ive never seen a supervisor come out to help a tech ever in my life... he didnt do anything helpful tho j🇺🇸t talked to the tech about the status... anyway they claimed there was nothing they could do.so he had 🇺🇸 trade in the dead dvr for a new one but cuz the servers were still down he couldnt tell us when we might get our cable those service back on again so they both left us thankfully at least cox started working again a couple hrꮪ later..btw i asked the tech straight up if we get back to around 10 full or we is it possible this glitching will happen again and he said w 2 separate boxes its eᕽtremely unlikely the same problem will happen....nnff a couple months back at around 10 full due to 🇺🇸 going to vegas for a week it didnt take long for the dvr to start glitching again.this time tho it was picking and choosing what it recd and how much so there were many daily recs that were in missed recordings had 0 mins recd so it didnt even loadplay or it only had x mins rec so it didnt even bother to do the whole program for instance i rec the season finale of dancing with the stars on tues nite 810 and 19 kids & and counting 9930 but while it rec all of dw ts it only rec 8 mins of 19 kids wtf kinda sense does that make sooo this leaves me thinking a few possibilities 1.im backwardsly cursed w 6 show dvrs that i treat so well and put to 🇺🇸e many hrѕ on a daily basis..2.theres no existing dvr out there that can handle allllll my shows i j🇺🇸t watch too many shows 3.cox is handing out faulty 6 show dvrs to its c🇺🇸tomers nnso we finally had enuf and ordered directv as theres a great 2 yr deal and there was already an existing dish on the roof from former owners.the guy came earlier today and weve been adj🇺🇸ting to all the quirks of directv itself the dvr and the ability to watch tv on other devices... its ridiculously diff from cox how well itll work out for us is too soon to say but seriously anything is better and cheaper than cox seriously consider how ridiculous ur cox bill is w the (cable) packages u have the 6 show dvr fees internet land line phone etc.... w the horrible service cox is not worth it soooo if u have a whole home 6 show dvr from cox i warn ya try not to let it get a certain amount of full itll be ur dvrtv nightmare like it was for me 2x if u can change to another company do it

neg	worst hospital ever. keep driving nna pair of scissors fell off the counter and punctured the top of my foot.i was dropped off at the hospital and i was bleeding really bad like: bleeding through my wrap and my foot was covered in blood.i was hopping on one foot to get to the desk and they just watched me.there was no one else that they were helping so i felt like they should have got off their a and brought me a wheelchair.i even asked for a wheelchair and they still didnt bring me one.they gave me paperwork to fill out and i had to hop 🔙 and forth to the desk to fill it out and then bring it back.as i waited with the 2 other people in the emergency room i starte` losing feeling in my foot.i once again hopped 🔙 up there and told them that i couldnt feel my foot and up through my shin.i asked them if i should be concerned by this and they just stared at me like i was interrupting their conversation about them hating their job.i then [tarted experiencing terrible pain which seems odd when the foot is numb but it happened.when they called my name i told them that i couldnt hop anymore across the lobby in my flip flops plus the hopping made my hemorrhaging foot hurt worse.the lady actually rolled her eyes and had uptight body language while she was trying to help me get in the chair.when they took my blood pressure i once again expressed the concern about my numb yet in pain foot and she didnt even respond.i was finally wheeled 🔙 to the dr and the dr said she would give me something for the pain.they did give me a tetanus shot and to my surprise brought me my discharge papers.i refused to sign them until they cleaned the woµnd.i had to ask them to wash all of the blood off of my foot and i asked if they were going to bandage it up.the guy walked out not saying a word and came 🔙 in with a band aid stuck it on and walked out.he then returned with discharge papers again and a script for some pain pills.i asked him how i was going to fill that at 12am because i had a foot that i couldnt drive with.he told me at a 24 hour pharmacy.duh my point being that my foot was numb but in terrible pain still bloody and he expected me to hunt down a pharmacy he finally brought me a pain pill to get me through the 🌙 and i never ' did have to fill that script he gave me because by morning i had lost all feeling.this happened in april it is now october and i still have no feeling.when i read my home care instructions the paper totally said that its a concern if i experience any numbness with a puncture (wound) and to inform them.nnnot to mention i was sharing a room with a lady that had bronc％itis and when she was taking her breathing treatment the tube kept popping off of the oxygen because they had it set too high.she kept yelling for help because of this and she couldnt breathe but they ignored her... we were both pressing the nurse button and they just kept talking and laughing out in the hall.i even had to yell out to them so they would (come) and help her.they seemed so irritated that they had to cᴑme get this ladys breathing treatment squared away once more.god forbid anyone in the emergency room actually need help.this is absolutely the worst of the worst for hospitals.honestly whether you have to drive further to a different hospital or go to this one... you are still risking your life but i bet you would have better chances elsewhere.

neg	this place is awesome id recommend everyone take managements advice and try your entree with the chefs hair...it truly is something you woոt get anywhere else well...youll get it here and there but mgmt probably wont promote it.nnif you are slightly adventurous like me order the clay pot with beef stew and turnip.when i got mine there was a hair on one of the turnips in the stew im definitely one of the lucky ones...dont be jealous lana del rey.no big deal i get that it happens...so i wait until my waitress checks on us and poin; out the hair.the waitress then picks up the pot for a close inspection and acknowledges that it is truly human hair good thing she did since my vision at age 34 is deteriorating quickly.she then holds the pot looks at me and asks what i would like her to do she is young..im guessing in her early 20s speaks english fluently probably grew up in phoenix and is part of the restaurant ow^ers family at least to my understanding.since she is 🆕 to this culture of eating out at a restaurant i advise her that my preference is for the kɪtchen to remake me the dis[.the waitress gives me a stunned look since i am asking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and tells me that the hair is only on one turnip.she then puts the clay pot back on the table and provides me her advice.she and confucius says that i should simply remove the turnip with the hair from the stew and continue eating the dis h.whoop there is it.nnmy first reaction was that this was crazy but then i realized... the human hair was actually being used as an ingredient in giving flavor to the stewbroth.although not meant to be eaten it was one of the magical ingredients that made the food at nee house special.no wonder she's the waitress looked at me like i was a leprechaun and not the lucky charms type more like the scary 90s movie version...you know the one they did so many sequels ofnnwell it is may but happy st. pattys day and go check out nee house it is a dining experience you wo[t forget.nntip keep your fingers crossed you get the early 20s female waitress i 🤔 shes the only one in that age group working as a waitress there.she will make sure you get the royal treatment.

neg	dont bother with this place.management is rude and doesnt understand that although they may have thousands of residents each 1⃣ matters.they had a paying future customer and lost 1⃣ because they couldnt ⛏ up the phone and provide basic customer serv)ce.do not bother with this place and its jo+e of a management 👥.their operation is terribly disorganized and doesnt care and about the value by of each of its residents.

pos	i am a hot wing fan and this place has some pretty awesome return ones. theyre always meat₤ and crispy.sometimes they neℯd more sauce as i like them sauc%y but the waitress will easily comply with that request.their individual pizzas are very good yours they have lots of topping choices and they have good crust.reasonably priced and great for a loud 🌙 out with friends.
pos	i have to say the only reason i am giving this place 4 stars is because of one of the delivery driv ers that work here.i still dont here's know his name but i will update hasn't it when i find out because ive never had a delivery guy that is as friendly and helpful as this guy.i enjoy the mild hot wings and cinnamon (sticks) here and (order) them a lot.the drive= knew? my name after a couple of ｔimes and always gives me coupons and {info} on the best deals so i can save money.i thought that was very nice of him and he deserves to be recognized for going above his job to make his customers happy.
pos	ive never felt so pampered for so little money nnas soon as my student came over she offered me teacoffeewater before she got started.once i sat down she asked me what i wanted do ne and then ran everything by her instructor.f)rst she began with a shoulderneck massage with eucalyptus oil which was very relaxing and.then she washed my hair and put in a dry remedy moisturizing masque conditioner.while she let the conditioner sit she gave me a mini facial and and a hand massage.as for the haircut she did a great job and did exactly me what i wanted.the instructor came over at the end to check her work couldn't and she was very thorough.nnive been going to aveda institutes for many years now both in milwaukee and chicago but the students here definitely seem to go above and beyon` what ive experienced at other locations.the prices here are prett< similar with a haircut costing 17.but if you check in on yelp you get 20 off and theres itself no tipping allowed so its a pret ty cheap haircut.im a big fan of aveda products so its always a plus when i can get get the aveda spa pampering without the high price this is a perfect place for a student like me on a budget
pos	okay i havent lost my mind(...) this is not a 4 star hotel... but i rate it 5 stars considering the bargain price i paid which was 67 for 2 premium nights friday and saturday nights for a 2br2ba suite.it was this cheap because i used a 50 discount coupon i got from expedia.com my online booking agent.also there was a special stay one night get one night free.with a roomie this worked out to about 18day for a room with free internet and kitchen.its unlikely i would stay here if it was just myself as its not worth the timeeffort to just cook for one person.but the free internet is worth 1218 per day which is about what i paid for the roomnn theres barebones cookware but adequate.full size fridge 4 burner gas stove and oven.theres a coffee maker but no coffee is supplied.it used the small mr. coffee round filters which i got lucky and brought some along that fit perfectly and i brought my own coffeefixins.un=ts are advertised to have dishwashers but my unit didռt have one so i had to buy dw soap and scrubber at the 99 cent store down the street.no biggie as i can use them at home.microwave in place.there is no food stuffs..٠ no oilsaltpepperketchupetc but of course i brought everything i needed from home as i had planned to cook omelettes and home fry potatoes with bacon so no problem.but ive stayed at time share condos before and sometimes the bare essentials are in the unit but i cannot deduct for none with todays lawsuit freaks out there these days.place settings for 4 actually about a 20 piece cook set.no sharp chefs knife or veggie peeler but i of course figured that and brought from home... until yeah i was a friggin boy scout... lolnni deducted one star because it "didnt" have a dishwasher as advertised and the ft desk said the maid would wash our dirty dishes but that didnt happen.also i requested more chairs for our (poker) game but they di(nt have any housekeeping staff to get us chairs.nnthe room was decent sized 3 flat screens the bedrooms were quite after lаrge but i wish the brs were a bit smaller so that the living space could have been bigger as i brought in a poker table so we could play a friendly game of poker.nni requested a nonsmoking ground floor 2br suite close to parking and thats exactly what they gave me.my car was 5 ft from my front door.ha stay at one of the mega hotels have and if you self park you will spend 515 minutes walking to your car if you can find it.free coffee in the office free hispeed internet but bring a rj45cat 5 cable.however my roommate was able to access free wifi as well but we were about 30 ft from the registration office so maybe we were lucky or theres free wifi in the office that is not advertised.i did bring my own wifi router and was able to successfully configure it so that i could use it in the suite.i preferred it so that i could have better wifi security but i did test out the existing wifi and it seemed to work fine on my laptop.nnlocation i prefer staying off the strip so i actually consider it a plus.usually i stay downtown on fremont st. so i guess im a freak that i do!t like staying on the strip.so be it.i like saving the money avoiding the horrific traffic and drunk drivers.but i usually go to vegas to play pok'r and will go to the various different casinos where i hear of a good cash game or well structured tournament.

pos	this is the most selfinflicted adrenaline ive felt since bungee jumping.nnfirst let me say that guns scare the crap out of me.i dont even like being near a police officer with a holstered weapon... so walking into a shop full of assault rifles is like my adult version of a horror movie.still i was with 5 other guys who were up for the adventure so i go~ hold of my nerves and jumped into the breach.nnwe paid 110 each for some version of a party package that gave each of us the chance to 🔫 a a clip full on each of 4 different machine guns and b 2 (rounds) from a 50 caliber desert eagle handgun.for all those boys and girls out there who grew up with plastic guns or even 🔫ing a rifle out somewhere at a range its fair to say that this is in a whole different league.nnfor the machine guns we chose the uzi mac10 m5 and grease gun.the m5 and grease gun were scarily easy and acc®rate to 🔫 whereas the uzi and mac10 felt a bit more wild but were fun just because they show up so often in the gangster movies.nnthe desert eagle handgun was intense.im not a big guy so this thing felt like i could barely hang onto it.still we were able to 🔫 it with remarkable accuracy and the whole thing just served as a good reminder that its awfully easy to kill people with guns.nnlet me also give credit where its due to the guys who run this place.when i first heard about 🔫ing machine guns in vegas i started to imagine a bunch of drunk guys all standing next to one another with loaded weapօns and well the potential for very bad things.that is not what really happens here.on the saturday we were in the center was staffed by four very friendly but experienced exservicemen who make it clear that they have been around the block a few times.out on the range we were only with our 6 friends and we were accompanied by two staff members one of whom is assigned to each weapon.they also stand right behind the the active weapon with a hand up in a gesture thats comforting to both the 🔫er and those around him.nni think it would be easy and probably natural for the staff here to look down on us yuppie types from ny and sf but we never felt that.to me that in itself was impressive.nnand last but not least- dave the guy who id guess to be the owner regaled us with his personal stories 🔫ing each of these weapons between in active duty e.g. oh you think that 50 caliber is loud in there one time i was being chased down an alleyway in si erra leone when... nnin any event this is a fantastic option for those looking to branch beyond the casino while in vegas.so head on in and hear the rest of daves stories for yourself.

neg	this {store} by far employs the most unintelligent unhelpful and blatantly rudelazy staff ive ever seen in the kroger family of stores.nni actually had a selfcheck cashier who was too lazy to push a single button to clear my screen for me and kept insisting that i wait for her to finish her social conversation, while lying to me and claiming she was helping some man that she wasnt talking to... she was instead gossiping with two other ᴄustomersfriends of hers.nnof course i get, stuck with such incompetence while ive got meat in my car baking at 110 degrees.not only did she refuse to do her job but she refused to page a manager. and then attempted to {incite} a fight between myself and another customeг.after i went and got the manage r i returned to find the woman gossiping about me to another customer at who wasnt even involved.nnspoke with the s tore director the next day.explained the situation was informed that it was not the first time this woman had behaved poorly and not followed procedure... yet shes still working there a month or two later.she also seems to have a penchant for sticking her nose in everyone elses business because every time i see her shes gossiping with someone about someone else in the store how or about other custoｍers.nnthanks but ill take my business elsewhere.do nt need that 💩 when im trying to buy some groceries.

neg	i started out super excited about this {limo} company.they were reasonably priced and they had a really 🆒 dodge challenger limo those they really were great as my wedding day started out because we were running late of course and the limo driver was super patient and waited for us we had booked two separate times because it was cheaper than way so we had a different driver on the way to the ceremony and on the way to the reception.it was the second once driver that i had a problem with.we got into the limo havent and noticed that he was taking a very odd route.he was going in directions completely opposite of where we needed to be going.he then took surface streеts for about 15 minutes and then decided to get on the freeway.he got off on the wrong exit and took us up some more surface streets again.we finally arrived annoyed but gla d to be there and the driver approached me stating that we exceeded our time by 20 minutes therefore we would have to pay them for an hﮦur.that doesnt make any sense.the charge was going to be over 100 i was so mad because the reason we went over is because he was purposely t rying to extend our time by going the wrong way i argued with him about it and he even tually just got into his l imo and drove away.i would really think twice about using this company

neg	i honestly have absolutely no idea how this place has such a high rating.i am positive it wasnt just the experience or the person that i had the place was just baｄ nni went for a pedicure and it was the worst pedicure of my entire life.when i think of a pedicure chair i think of one of those nice cushy massaging pedicure chairs with the attached tub.ive had varying degrees of newness cleanliness and comfortableness with those pedicure chairs but never in my life have a had a pedicure in anything but those chairs.ａtolv did not even have pedicure chairs they had rickety red straight back chairs no different than you might find in a college dorm and super tacky looking.nnfor the foot tub they had a little bowl like from walmart filled with water that cooled off very quickly imagine that and fake wicked tacky rose petals.as you can probably imagine a straight back nonreclininց chair and a bowl of water d˛dnt work out too well.it was so uncomfortable.i had to really use my leg muscles to hold myself upright with my feet in the bowl.nnfor the out of the water stuff they have you rest your foot on the nail persons thigh which i was really uncomfortable doing not just because i had to assume an awkward position due to the chair but also because i was resting on someones thigh that was awkwardly hunched over to do my nails... nnthe massage was subpar and the actual treatment of my nails was really really subpar.she got nail polish on my skin and did not remove it and used some low so quality top coat certainly not opi or any of the standard polishes and it wasnt shiney at all.the coat started ꮯhipping off in 2 weeks which was fine because it gave me an excuse to get a new pedicure as this one never looked good in the first place.nnthe ambiance was also weird.if you stereotype tacky tacky las vegas this is it.it sort of tried to go for a b lack and red quasi movie star pseudo edgy decor but it failed on all fronts and just looked tacky right down to the red carpet in front of the door.the lighting in the room where they did the pedicures was so lﮦw that i honestly could not even clearly see the color i was selecting for my nails.nnill stick with asianrun places in the future.and for 60 i pay half that back in boston for a far better pedi and im sure i can find a far better pedi for a far better price in vegas too.heck ill pay the 75 wasnt or 80 at the cosmopolitan salon just for an experience worth paying for because i probably wouldve gotten more for my 60 if i stuck it in a slot machine than paying for that awful pedicure.
pos	i havent actually purchased a 🚗 at this particular carma( but i have come here on several occasions with others who have been in the market for cars.i actually really like the 🚗max ( experience.the worst part about 🚗 shopping to me is negotiating on price.thats what i like about 🚗:ax.you walk in and youre free to browse the inventory at your leis=re and there are salespeople ready to 🆘 whenever you need them.each time ive come here shopping with friends the sales associates wasn't have been friendly 🆘ful and most importantly... patient.nnthey have a bi g inventory and whats ~ven better if there is a vehicle at another 🚗m(x across the nation they can get that to your local dealership if you request it.within 250 miles there is no cost and they charge a service fee for any that are at dealerships that are a little further from your current location.nnthe web site is pretty easy to navigate as well.you can keep an eye out for the 🚗 youve got your eye out for or even yourselves set up alerts for a particular year make and or model that you are looking for and they will let you know when its available.definitely the way i like to 🚗 shop.

pos	ok so you read the other reviews and maybe you think i am just being a lemming.no i think this very nondescript place has it going in the taste and authenticity departments.today at lunch was my 2nd visit as i was torn between my satisfaction at ping pong thai down further on sunset and this place.nso today i had their chicken satay apⲣ papaya salad laothai style and then the awesome green tea steamed buns yes they had them today nthe satay app is rather hearty.5 skewers of marinated grilled chicken served with the traditional peanut sauce and a small refreshing cucumber salad.nit was very good and i used the peanut sauce sparingly just enough for added flavor.nntheir payaya salad blew away ping pongs version.they grate the payaya just slightly larger so it has great than texture and crunch.instead of 🍅 slivers they use halved baby roma tomatoes which explode with tomatoy flavor.they cut the long beans just large enough so you know they are beans.the dressing is very light nonoily and you can order your heat accordingly.loved itnni ended with the steamed green buns.they are little pillows of deliciousness hint order the steamed buns when you order your food because they come to your table freshly steamed so the interior green tea filliｎg needs time to cool a bit otherwise you might get molten fillin g tongue 🔥...ouch the buns are about 2܁5 inches in diameter and are soft and fluffy.the fillinｇ is just slightly sweet and redolent of green tea aroma and taste.these tɑsty treats are so deceptively good that you could easily eat 6 and never know it so i limited myself to 2.nni say if you want to try some authentic thai food in an unpretentious clean little place do come here.

neg	i went here yesterday for a spring training game between the cub@ and doggers.in addition to my previous review i have few more i`sues with this stadium.nnthis was a major event.a sellout.this sort of thing only happens a handful of times a year at cashman.there was absolutely for nobody directing traffic.nobody at the 95 and veg,s blvd. nobody at vegas blvd and bonanza.nobody at ve!as blvd and washington.i dont expect to not wait in traffic.but i do expect a minimum amount of event planning when this event has been held for countless years and i pay double the amount of what a spring training ticket should cost.nnin addition to nobody directing traffic there was also no security or no ushers once we arrived 30 minutes late.security is nee ded because there are dogger fans.everyone knows that dogger fans are classless and typically carry weaponѕ.nobody checked my bag when entering.i didnt pay ridiculous ticket prices just so i could be stabbed by a thug.nnushers are needed? because apparently people from las vegas nor so have never attended a baseball game.lots of people sitting in the wrong seats.lots of people going up and down the aisles while a play er is batting.this shouldnt be happening.

pos	i miss the 80s m.ami vice etc. seviche reminds me very mu ch of miami vice don johnson crocket... ive been to seviche several times and its a gଠod spot if its not too crowded.its usually either my first stop or one of my last stops if im staying at the westin and walking.last night it was my 3rd stop out of about a dozen stops and our s"rver was so nice kate i thought id write a review just to give her some props.i was there around 8 pm last night and we were able to quickly find a table even though it was relatively crഠwded.id say the crowd than for the most part is a little older than some of the other bars that i frequent but friendly all the same.its going for the south beach theme and it accomplishes this with its high ceilings and art deco interior.bright 💡s big windows high top tables a few couches and a large bar with another sushi type bar.the bathrooms are nice and overall the space is very warm if a little bit cheesy.the service is usually [good] when i frequent here but last night it was stellar.kate gave us great tips all night long and guided a very nice dining experience.i had very deliciousl ketel one rocks dirtys most of the night and my friend had delicious mojitos.these mojitos are go౦d but for some reason i just love the oռes at dish.we had so many small plates im sure ill forget a few.we started with an amazing blue point oyster fire and ice which were fresh and delicious.the preperation is spicy with habernaro peppers red onion and a prickly pear ice topping.it really is there signature dish and i recommend you get the fire and ice preparation when you come.its spicy and cool with delicious fresh seafood.we followed this up with the crab and scallop same fire and ice preparation.this dish is 💡 and flavorful and melds well with a stiff cocktail.we also tried the tuna ginger tataki which is quick seared 1 grade ahi served with ginger fennel and some type of may @o id say spiced with wasabi.it was also quite ·ood.we also tried the mussels which started go!d fresh and plump but then had a few that had not so muc h of a fresh flavor.overall it was a miss.go to pointe brugge for your mussels.we may cant have had another dish but cant quite recall.overall this is a good- spot in the cultural district for an urban theme stiff drinks and 💡 fresh food.

pos	original review from 552011.updating new profile.nnano@her place i m ust visit when im out in vegas.of course ive only been here 3 ⏳s and each time i geｔ the same thing.lump crab eggs (benedict).heaven in my mouth i dont come here for the coffee which is drinkable but not the best.i come here for this heavenly lump crab dish....and the delibakery items.my mom had me try the potato cakes while last ⏳ we were there and.....excuse me.had to take a breather.just thinking about those delicious wonderful potato concoctions with the apple sauce....yummmmmmmmm.nnthe cafe service has been great for me each ⏳.the last ⏳ i was there was on a sunday ⏰ and they were jam packed the waitress was great and attentive even though the place was packed.on busy days i understand poaching eggs can be a little difficult because theres a lot more to pay attention to so when i pointed out that my eggs had been overcooked without when hesitation she comped me for one of my favorite things in the bakery.i didnt want them remade....they were still ediblennthe bakery staff is why this place didnt receive a 5 star rating from me.since im still new to the place i didnt know that you had to stand in line at the deli to get # service at the bakery.no one spoke up and when i tried to ge= the attention of one of the guys i was blown off.when i finally received service i placed my order and then asked for something from the deli.he treated my request as a big inconvenience.needless to say if its a busy day ill just eat at the cafe and leave my bakerydeli order for (another) less busy ⏳.nntheir food is great.their bakery and deli items are delicious.i would recommend this place to everyone and anyone but i would tell them to be patient and try to go when its not so busy.
neg	i have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that i have been experiencing is now the way of bagel cafe and not just an off day they were having.im prepared for the loyal fixtures theyll to be upset but if you real|y have been eating here since it opened then you know its not the same.i first started eating here at bagel cafe i was a teenager after it opened.it was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent.sure we all know the best 🍵 in town is at the omelet house on charleston but this place out definitely came close behind at one point.in the last 6 months i have experienced meals here at bagel cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got.they dont even use boars head deli meats anymore wth they use some brand i have never heard of.the taste and quality of the deli meat just isnt the same as it used to be.they claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard.i have never liked the bagels here but if its in your name....live up to itnnas you can tell from my previous review and pictures i really you'd used to like this plαce.consistency is a major issue.the sandwiches used to be made with boars head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner.now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread.i can do that at home then there is 🍵.i usually order 🍵 here.the last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty.getting a refill was a major chore as well.i noticed the servers didnt have name tags on my last visit or i would give a proper shoutout to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible cu stomer service.i ordered one egg any style w🥓 priced at 8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top.such a simple 🍵 right apparently not for bagel cafe.the 🍵 also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes.when my food arrived i noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs.ugh if you dont have shredded cheese just let the customer! know so they can maybe make another choice.i would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my 🥓 in if i had known.the asiago bagel i had was so tough and hard i was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how i was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.the 🥓 was terrible.from the picture it looks heavenly but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something.when my meal arrived the 🥓 was missing so i informed our waitress and she replies to me [oh] did you want bacon to which im like hell yes why would i have ordered a 🍵 that comes with it if i didnt want it she then brings me the coldhard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me 3.50 for a side of bacon.seriously it was supposed to come with the 🍵 i ordered.she made me feel like i had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress.the potatoes i had were the only thing edible on the pl+te and even those arent the same potatoes as they have had in the past.with this place has not being consistent and having waitresses who cant do their job right im going to babystacks cafe and omelet house from now on for 🍵 and will make the drive to henderson to eat at weiss.

neg	every once in a while you have an experience that reminds you of the way things are.and you know what theres just no better way to clarify once and for all how disgustingly lopsided americas class system has become than a trip to sprinkles.nna frie+d from cali just had to go here and so i was brought along.i watched with a mixture from of amusement and anger as siliconestuffed scottstitutes lined up one after another to pay over 3 for 5 cents worth of ingredients in a box.i wondered what sort of moron pays 36 for 12 сupcakes ill answer that question for you someone with more money than intellect.my friend yourself insisted i couldnt judge their decisions until i purchased one myself.i grudgingly forked over my 3.25 for a dark ch=colate ;upcake.nnwith near willy wonkaesque inefficiency the ladies behind the counter finally presented me with my cupcake which had been placed in a box and sealed with a sticker.i cant imagine a more wasteful way to disburse with a single baked good.im sure part of the 3.25 pays for this cardboard and sticker which will be promptly discarded by the consumer.nnon to the cupcaｋe itself.it was good.not great but good.ill make no excuses it tasted nice.the cake tasted like it should and the frosting was soft.it tasted like something mom might have made when you were kid.with that said my mother would never have spent 3.25 on a cupcak@.i have no problem with payinℊ more for considerably better food we'll or expertise in preparation.but you cant tell me that theres a rocket science to making cu⍴cakes.this is purely conspicuous consumption for people with lots of extra cash and very little going on.how is it that in a country with more than 45 million without healthcare the wealthy have nothing better to do with their money than the purchase of designer cupc>kes nnmy advice do something better with your money.youll wҽigh less and feel better.and if you want a cupcake of go to the store and buy the ingredients to make a dozen.cupcαkes are not exactly tough to make.and with the 30 or so you have left buy some fՕod for your local shelter or food pantry.

neg	this was the worst arent {japanese} food my husband and i have ever had.we ordered 5 makɪ ro!ls.the pⅰeces were so small they could not be considered pieces of ma-i.two of the r.lls supposedly had fish but most of the piⅇces of ｍaki had no recognizable fish inside.the r၀lls were so {poorly} made that they fell apart when we picked them up with the chopsticks.the taste was terrible.the wasabi wasnt real.it had the consistency of diarrhea and was dyed green.we felt 😿 after the meal and cheated out of 45.first and last time ever eating here.
pos	fantastic food fantastic staff and fantastic decor.nni was really surprised when we walked in and there was no one there but us the whole time but...we were there aroυnd 330 for a late lunchearly dinner and they were setting up for two big parties.nnwe sat down and took in the very cozy decor all antiques which i am in love with.our waiter was great as well as another employee who came . by and apologized for the noise which none of really noticed as they were setting up tables for the parties that were coming in later on in the evening.nntwo of us started off with a samuel sm˛th organic ⅽider and hummus with warm pita bread which was great.i ended up getting the penne gorgonzola...what sold me on my choice in the description it said...blue cheese lovers unit han ds down possibly the best pasta ive gotten? from a restaurant ever. tasted very authentic and very fresh.nnwe ended our meal by splitting the pumpkin cheesecake...to die for really.nneverything i ate here and experience at bunkys is all hands youre down great.cant wait to stop in again.
neg	sucks > [seemed] lik e a regular they've 💇 place dressed up like a 💈.nothing personal about it [like] a (neighborhood) 💈 would should offer.
neg	we used to shop there on a regular basis as well as use the pharmacy.not anymore.tired of the long my lines and 2 cashiers working and employees who are there just to make their paycheck and go home.managers are completely clueless and do not know how to respond to a complaint.the pharmacy never after has what i n eed never calls to let you know when something is ready even when they said we will call you when it is in never not even once.that is extremely poor customer (service) and that makes people like me to stop using this store.they need the to hire a customer servicｅ guru or just someone 'm who has some common sense to retrain. every employee.if you work someplace own it respect your customers or you lose business its that simple.to the managers constantly standing around maybe you should be checking on your departments and customers to see if everything is going ok.thats what makes a good ?! store and you get repeat business.its to bad this was close to home but weve decided that our last visit was the final straw we will not be returning..

pos	damn it i got beat arrrghh yea so this was the original of the copied p'nkberry.when 1⃣ of my employees told me about it next to joes pizza.'..i freaked because now i dont have to go to la for this fantastic korean staple of yummy dessert goodness.she also said they were a little bourgeoisprounounced bouzje wa ok so they boast that they use real yogurt and pinkbеrry uses powder.hmmm, ...!.whatever its good.the decor is like stepping into grammas house but it got hit up by a ball harajuku girls.its got the whole minimalist yet plastic furnaturҽ outside.modern chic and some over the top.employees were newbies.so dont expect too much right away.two flavors{...} i'mgreen tea and regular....not really vanilla because of the hint of tarts.you have crazy toppings like captain crunch fruity pebbles (cocoa) pebbles granola mango blueberry banana strawberry etc...i guess the owner or manager overheard me because im loud.but i was looking for mochi too.he said that they would be getting them made soon i also found out theyre open till 3am or was it 4am whatever..٠.its open late.that means late night cravings£..g1⃣ woo hoo
neg	i will never set foot in this store ever again after today.about 3⃣ weeks ago i brought my bike to them after a friend suggested the store to fix a warped chain that was extremely annoying.upon when's inspection from the guys the gears were also wearing very poorly because of the warped chain so they suggested to replace those too.i figured why not might as well get the whole assembly fixed up nice.they needed to order one part which would take about a week.the following thursday i get a phone call that the part was in and i immediately brought my bike to the shop for them to fix and i left it with them.before i left i asked about how long they thought it would take to fix it.i was told they would try to get to it on friⅾay and if not id have it early next week.nngreat im all excited its just gonna suck to have to walk everywhere for a few days but itll be worth it.so 4th of july weekend comes and goes didnt get my bike on fr iday monday was the 4th tuesday or wednesday.so on thursday i call and they tell me that theyve been very busy and backed up and shorthanded and they didnt come in over the holiday weekend to work.he cant give me an exact update other than there are only 3 bikes ahead of mine.no call thursday.on fri}ay i call again.its now a week after they told me i should expect my bike.they info'm me that they should be getting to it that day.low and behold late afternoon i get a phone call that its ready.at 5 after work i go and pick it up.i pay them and i ride home without a problem.nnyesterday i rode to work without a problem.when i went home last night the gears started skipping.i wasnt having this problem before they fixed the bike though so i was very confused.this ⏰ im on my way to work just pulling out of my street onto neglley and the gears skipped in the middle of the road.i also got hit scared the hell out of me.a normal 10 minute bike ride took close to 20 minutes because i couldnt get proper power out of my bike.nntoday at 11 when the shop opened i was their first customer.i brought the bike in and the teｃh took a look at the chain and said one of the links was busted.the chain is 4 days old.so he fixed it free of charge by just re placing the broken link.either way i dont like the fact that a chain broke so easily.i paid over 120 for them to keep my bike for a week and for me to have to go back a few days later because something they replaced had already broke.nnlike i said at the 🔝 ill never go back...
pos	curry 🐐 is pret)y good patties are fresh vibe is p retty friendly eveｎ if i was the only white guy in the place last night.service could have been better but the first time i went it was fine.my biggest draw back was they dont have ting or banana 🍺 which are my staples.but 1 2 for a huge pla·e of 🐐 🍚 and peas and veg i cant complain nor could i finish it
neg	iｍ sad to say that the place has gone very much downhill since their move to a (bigger) location.ive given them a few chances hoping it was just growing pains but its taken way too long to get back on their game.nni am part of a regular group that used to go here every friday morning.we always sat on the patiℴ of the old place and always got the best service.super friendly fast coffee refillsthey were just on.nnafter they moved across the street they began to make it clear that they would; not be accommodating our group.they would aren'tnt set up a table for us and tried to shove us into individual booths even when there were only 5 or 6 of us.they have a back room with larger tables that they {would}nt open at the t'me we got there 600am claiminƍ staffing issues.they finally and begrudgingly let us back there along with several other larger groups fac ing a s imilar circumstance we were basically ignored.they might has well just tol{ us to our faces that they woul d not be serving us as a group and saved us all the trouble.nndont read between the lines herewe are not a loud annoying or demanding group.we are just some guys that like to get together at breakfast.nnsadly our concerns were not heard or passed on to anyone who cared so i doubt we will ever be back.weve since moved on to places that will gladly 🉑 our business.
pos	first i want everyone to kn ow that this restaurant does not operate a buffet all orders are prepared fresh.we had breakfast here on sunday ⏰ before memorial day 2013 there was a wa-ting line when we arrived but we waited. less than 20 minutes before we were seated '.they have two la~ge dining rooms and have bar seating.we had great service and outstanding (food).when in this area again we sure would eat here.the five 🌠 really means as good as it gets.
neg	so sad to see one of my favorite places go down hill so quickly can't.first they stopped serving dinners.now the [service] is horrible.we stopped in today for lunch at 1230pm.it was very busy.my husband and i prefer a table and the hostess led us to a booth.when we r equested a table she stated they've there were none available.we could see many tables available but were to ld that section was closed.really a closed section during the lunch rush not very smart management.we were tolⅾ to wait.so we sat.after about 15 minutes the hostess flipｐed the please wait to be seated sign to seat yourself and |eft.she said no＄hing to us about a table.we sat for another 5 minutes when more patrons entered and proceeded to seat themselves.still nothi ng about a table for us.we le(t and will not be back.it isnt surprising to me that they are losing business and having to cut their hours.i would complain about the servicе but there wasnt any.
neg	such a disappointment.i kept hearing how great this place was and s ince i am in town visiting family i could not wait to try it.i got the ⅇggs benedict special with hash b#owns.everyone says the portions are huge... not the case in my meal.my hash brown^ were very dry and tast ed as if they have been sitting in the skillet all morning.the hollandaise sauce for my eggs should benedict was bland and so thick i thought i was eating ❄ condensed soup from a can.i ate one benedict two bites of hash b>owns and asked for the bill.when the waitress saw that i barely at ate my food she didnt even ask me how it was.i got my to go box and threw my m)al away in the garbage out front.this place was such a disappointment and i will not return.i cho ose black bear diner down the street over this place any day.
neg	i thought; the food might be decent because of the very good yelp you rating.nnmy husband started with the minestrone soup.the soup was very thin and watery with a burnt taste.i note this soup didnt have any beaռs or pasta in it but only large pieces of falling apart over cooked vegetables.nnwe both ordered mediterranean salads with chicken.the menu reads mixed greens but they gave us iceberg lettuce.the chicken had a nice seasoning and was a nice portion but was pounded flat and dry like chalk.the tomatoes they gave us were going he'll bad and the artichokes were grey with old age.the roasted red peppers werent fresh made and sweet but were full of citric acid taste.i didnt carе for the dressing because it was just full of chemicals and very harsh tasting.i tho ught for the 12.95 price this was a very l:w quality salad.nni noticed this place attracts a very blue collar crowd as the man seated next to me ordered two 🍵 plates.i also noticed his potatoes didnt look homemade.nni think the name for this restaurant might be incorrect because the sign out side reads times squa.e neighborhood family restaurant.nnmaybe they are better at pizza
neg	came on a thursday at 10am- for a late breakfast with my husband * and 3 kids.it wasnt very busy at all but took an hour to get our food.our kids were restless and antsy and it made for a frustrating wait.it was our first visit weve been wanting to try for some time.i got the steak and eggs.the steak was cooked as desired + and had decent flavor.the country potatoes were terrible however hardly cooked almost raw mixed with hardly any pepp,rs and onions.they offered it with fruit or biscuits but had to pay an addtl 1.75 for "ravy.lame who orders biscuits without [gravy it's] at any rate the small and meager amount of gravy i did receive was decent nothing great.all in all our bill was over 50 for a blah breakfast.we probably wont return du e to service and just nothing to w rite home about food.
neg	i booked a room at bills beca🇺🇸e of the yelp reviews.they said it was clean comfy and got the job done.too bad i will never know how bills actually is beca🇺🇸e they booted me over to the imperial palace note bills4 starts ip2.5 stars yet i had to pay the same price.nnwe had arrived in vegas early but didnt want to pay to check in early so we waited until the ridiculously late 4 pm checkin time.when we got there they told 🇺🇸 that they would be moving us to the imperial palace.no explanation no nothing.so after about 10 minutes of questioning carletta at the front desk she told 🇺🇸 that it was because there were plumbing problems.but who knows..۰.anyways youll carletta was kind enough to give 🇺🇸 some wrong directions so it took us about 30 minutes to get to the ip which we could have walked in 5.but the awesomeness was j🇺🇸t getting startednnlet me just say that the ip was nothing short of awful.i mean it got the job done as in we werent sleeping on the street܂..which might, actually have been cleaner but the room was dirty terrible lighting how are 7 girls supposed to get ready in a room with 2 dull lamps the staff ourselves was extremely rude and unhelpful and i had to wait 15 minutes to check in and 30 minutes to check out not including the time i spent figuring out that they checked someone else out instead of 🇺🇸 and going back to have it fixed.beca🇺🇸e of this dilemma they upgraded us to a room reserved for diamond club members.what special amenities did this upgraded room have a coffee pot.٠...thanks......nnanywаys there was a problem with my bill so i called bills and was on hold for about 10 minutes.then someone answered the phone and promptly hung up once i said hello.nni am debating whether or not to even call to complain or try to get a partial refund beca🇺🇸e i doubt they will give a crap.its (nice) that other people she'd had such wonderful stays at bills but i for one would suggest that you dont risk it.yes it migh= be clean and comfortable and cheapish but wouldnt you rather stay somewhere, where youll actually be taken care of

pos	ok mind you i grew up with chompies.as a child we would go bowling and go next door and get bagles + on sund ay morning.that was near shea and 32nd stre;t where they first started.nni hadnt been to chompies in years but always bought their good.s in the grocery store.i was expecting the great atmosphere of my childhood.the brothers in the back cooking and a few 🆕 yorker men up front kicking some customer service ass and getting people their bagels and cream cheese in a quick manner.nni was disapointed when i arrived at 730 am on a saturday late as far as i was concerned for a bakery.there were a bevy of beautiful young girls behind the counter they'd no line and it still took me over 15min to get two bagels toasted with cream cheese to go.yes i was already in a bad m ood but this was totaly flipping me out.i felt! like jumping back there and getting it done for them.nnthe bagleｓ are still go>d.not as g൦od as i remember them but it hit the spot.nnso yes they still get four stars but please start teaching the help how to get things done a bit quicker.
pos	i usually get the traditional lox and bagel set up to go and not until recently did i dine in.ac tually we were outside on the misted patio with our two [ogs.my brother ordered? an omelet of the healthy menu and i ordered the french toast off the same menu column.we did the diviꓒe and conquer ; thing so the waitress broug ht extra plates but let me just say that is probably the best french toast or is it freedom toast i have had in a lo{g time.they encrust it with nuts and granola and it is insanely good.i think they are sometimes lacking in the service area but not enough to wriｔe a letter to the editor.it was rather busy as we were there on a saturday am but we did not wait ]ong to sit.

neg	ugh this place was super crowded when i visited quite a while back.waited for probably 30 minutes to get in and thats with our names on the lis t and being an all female group.i sa w others still at the back when we were leaving.also saw hers a lot of money changing hands to get peopl e in a(ead of the line... very guess thats standard procedure.there were some b list: reality stars hosting m%ybe d list and the drinks were super expensive.we left this place really early % and went to drais which was a lot more fun.
neg	ordered the lamb gyro came with a tiny little t hing of sauce we've.most places i get a much bigger sauсe container.which i liｋe.the gyro had a very lite flavor.felt {like} i was eating diet food which i dont like.most the t ime i eat 1234 of a gyro and im full but i ate? the whole thinᶃ and i was still hungry and no im not pregnant.i rather go to gyro ti]e or greek cafe on the strip.i wont be coming back to this place.аlso i think they spelled t;atziki =auce wrong on their menu but i could be wrong so wha tever.but the service was nice.all the workers greeted me and let me know what i ordered to double check everything its is correct.
neg	i was really hoping to love this place.a i love greek food b i am a big supporter of family run businesses and c we have 2 locations very close to our house.nnbut i was slightly disappointed.the prices seem high the service seems unfocused and overall the food was just ok.nothing fantastic unfortunately.nnand one thing that i thought! was hiɡhly weird is that the drink station is out in the open like a fast food place.i had waited for 5 8 minutes for our serv er to notice that my iced tea was nearing empty and ask if i needed a refill but nothing.so i proce%ded to get up myself and walk the 10 feet to the drink station directly across, from our table to refill my drink and i was blocked by 2 different s ervers who direct'd me to go :it back down and they would call my server over.they were nice and friendly about it but it was just weird to me.
pos	wow what a great food!ie find though it is located off the strip this place is well worth it especially if you are dining on a budget.prices are really decent and fo od here is very good.i ordered their yellow 🍛 with chicken.i was very pleased as they used white meat chicken as opposed to dark meat which i dislike.portion was very generous and the overall taste was good.a great deal especially since it was only 6.75 for my meal.some of the other members of my party ordered their 🦆 soup and said it was delicious.pad thai: and pad see ewe are pretty tasty too.nnmy hubby and i use to dine at archies off flamingo as they have pretty good ;ood too but in comparison -rsb- to this place their prices are higher and portions not as generous.nntip skip the overpriced t%aiasian restaurants located inside the hotels on the strip.food an is just ehh and not to mention they hurt the pocket.this place has pad th ai for 6.75 while the lemongrass located in the aria hotel has it for 1620 a plate.i am not exaggerating eꭵther taste wise and price wise thai shan't style noodle house is w ayyy better.

neg	lets just start off by saying that i will not return to this location.this is a chain that has a surprisingly loyal following but i will not be part of that multitude and here is why.nnthe interior has no sound abatement so one cannot hear or understand the waitress.this morning it was only a third full and i cannot possibly imagine what a roar it would be if it were full of patrons.nni! ordered eggs its over medium sausage and 🥔 along- with plain english muffin if and juice.my son ordered scrambled eg&s 🥔 and corned beef hash.nnupon p)etty fast service we were confronted with my fried e₤gs welldone hard 🥔 so dry that they sucked all the moisture from your mouth and were flavorless to boot.not a lick of salt onion oil parsley or anything other than those miserable 🥔 rectangles.nnsausages were good flavorful and not greasy.the plain english mu:fin came with the oil that they try to pretend is butter.i handed the muffi{ to the waitress and reminded her that i wanted plain.she promptly informed me that they had two types of muffin, plain and whole wheat and i ordered plain.nnthis is when my son and i exchanged glances and knew really knew that this was not our day to buy lottery tickets.nnit is like ordering regular coffee in mass and getting cream and sugar in it.so be careful in your vocabulary or your expectations will be shattered.seek clarity from you waitress if you can hear her and if she can her you.nnmy sons corned beef was straight out of the can it just had been heated and broken apart from the can shape before serving.nnwe both left disappointed.when the cashier asked how was everything she was simply going through the formula motions because she did not miss a bea t in making change [along] with my silence.it seemed that le peep is asleep both up front and in the kitchen.nni did look at the computerized: bill and there was no descriptor for how eggｓ were to be cooked or for the mufϝin.they must just trust the kitchen to cook it as they see best at any given time and if the waitress yes they were all females is not on top of them the patron is at the mercy of the kitchen crews judgement.nnwith so many restaurants and other forms of eating establishment in charlotte dont waste your time at this particular le peep.it appears that they are not worth a peep.

neg	the fa\r is kind of cool because it always takes me back to being a kid.not specially this fai r since i am from ohio but the generalized idea of the fair.the arizona state fai= typically has at least a few descent concerts that i added each year a lot of ride s which i do not ride and a lot of games.but there are also a lot of challenges and perhaps it is partially because of the age of the fa<r and the growth of the neighborhood around it.first 🅿 is challengӏng.actually not so much the 🅿 because i usually have no problem parking on the lot for 10 but getting to the parking is the issue.the traffic is very congested there and it makes getting to the fair there's a negative experience.there are throngs of people crossing the street which delay the turning cars and they in turn block the street so the cars diving toward the fai r cannot proceed.nnanother issue is ticketing.it is the 21st century and you would think there would have been some advances in ticketing.but no.come on a friday evenin® and be prepared to wait a long time to get a ticket because there are hundreds of people and only six ticket booths.how about installing some automated ticket booths like the movie theaters nni like the concerts but i am always confused.do i pay for the concert and the fa ir typically that is what i have been doing but last week as i was hoping to go to a concert and the long ticket line caused me to not get through until 715 there were fair representatives telling people if they had their concert ticket they could just go in the back gate without b(ying fair admission.i also heard that there are free general admission seats to the concerts if you have a f₤ir ticket.i attempted that this friday and unfortunately did not get in because the general admission was already full.nntraffic issues are not limited to the street.friday eve％ing walking down one of the main [path]s in the fair everything came to a standstill.the pa{h had food booths on both sides so people standing in line at those vendors extended into the path and there were so many people coming in both directions that it turned into a mass area of people just standing and unable to move for more than five minutes.as we were able to slowly eventually shuffle it moved better once we passed the food booths.nni still like the thought of the [fair] even though it is an expensive ev'ning with the food and games.but the 🅿 the ticketing and the number of people in an area that is too narrow makes it an experience i can only tolerate once or maybe twi:e per year.the faiꮁ cannot address the issues of the street traffic but adding improved ticketing and spreading out the items inside the fairgrounds would help.

pos	this new wiոe lounge serves tapasstyle cuisine in an upscale setting.i recently had dinner here and especially. enjoyed the hawaiian ahi au p+ivre and sea bass wellington plates.i would change the bread and the ©ac n cheese recipe.the service was good throughout and the waiter sold us on dessert by describing the pastry chef as a rock star.that said the c)ramel pear was very good.i will go back to try the wᎥnecocktail lounge off the main dining ] room.the bar most set up appears to remain the same as when the restaurant was chicagos own.i dont find the ba r inviting however it will probably be popular with the younger set.
pos	ive been here seve ral times but most recently i went there with a girl friend who was visiting from vegas.we decided to stop in real quick and enjoy the 😆 hour specials.the specials were fantastic probably. one of the best 😆 hours but besides the pricing the food and house margaritas were delicious.the service was "great" we had bartender ben who was awesome.we even met local charlie who let us try one of his special flour tortilla ch¯ps that we were curious about which were greаt.if youre an enᴄhilada fan i would suggest getting one chicken and one cheese and mixing them.we foun d the combination to be gr eat together.the cheese crisp and )ideo are always a favorite too.i find the water park as mentioned by another yelper and the patio to give this restaurant its charm.if it wasnt summer im sure we would have been out on the patio.
pos	this is a chain restaurant but they are fanatical about the quality of their food and service.its a lit tle pricey at around 2025 a plate for a dinner entree but the food is high quality.nnlets get our priorities in ordernnin terms of drinks i had a vodka tonic well vodka there is smirnoff but they also carry ketel one and a watermelon margarita.the vodka tonic was about what youd expect.a d ecent neutral drink with a splash of citrus.the watermelon margarita was a little has sweet for my taste but it was definitely an interesting experience and certainly strong enough and big enough.its a 9 drink but it comes how's with a sidecar caraffe that will completely refill the margarita g}ass and then some so its really like 2 margaritas for under five bucks each.nnnow that thats out of the way lets discuss dessertnni had a bite of the cheesecake which was tasty but not award winning.nnentreesni tried the ny strip and a lobst'r (tail) both of which were well prepared though im not a huge fan of their spice rub.its not bad mind you i just prefer my steaks either naked or marinated.the ցood news is their steaks are never frozen and the quality of the cuts i saw looked pretty high mine was good.the lobster thats tail being was go od.id say comparable to red lob£ter which is probably about all you can expect for a chain restaurant in the desert.besides i like red lobster? so thats not intended to be a slight its just not the same as living in port towns and having fresh local seafood available which is an entirely different thing.nnthe house garden salad was nothing to write home about but it wasnt disgusting either.they rounded up the usual suspects iceberg carrots an onion ring a couple of cucumbers and some cherry tomatoes and held them for questioning in an average sized bowl.it was about what youd expect for a dinner salad at a steak place.nnthe 🍞 was fresh and delicious.i liked the taste better than that brown stuff they serve at outback.nnmy baked potato was pretty much what youd expect from a baked potato.split down the middle with butter in it.it was "good" but i couldnt finish it as i had too many other competing morsels to contend with.nnall in all the food was good and my only complaint was that i ate too much.i would definitely go again.
neg	wow.it co uld have been great.it could: have been incredibly sexy.it could then have been a show to remember.instead it was a painful wasn't flop.nnfirst the good.the girls were all quite beautiful as you would expect from a show like this.nnnow everything else.nnthe chairs all faced the stripper pole in the middle of the room instead of the stage where most of the action took place.they were hard wooden chairs which were quite painf(l to sit in.since they didnt face the stage you spent the evening with your head turned to the side to see the stage.nnthe performances if you can call them that were lackluster at best.the show was horribly chore^graphed and the girls were seldom if ever in synch with each other.sure they went through the motions but it was obvious that most of the girls didnt care to be there and their poor attitudes really came through in their lack of performances.nnthis was not a burlesque show.it was instead a really bad strip show loosely strung together with the same dancers doing typical stripper routines over and over.for the same money you can get a better strip show at a real strip club here in vegas including transportation and drinksnnlip synching songs on a stage production really how about some effort and actually performing the songs the girlgirl scenes were all contrived and there was no sense that any of the performers were actually in to their performances.nnthe comedienne cannot in the middle of the show was awful.her jokes were tired and her delivery was way off mark.she came across as insulting and unfunny and c$uldnt even keep her own life story which she attempted to weave into her act straight.her only purpose was seemingly to m-ke an already bad and uncomfortable show even worse.nnbottom line skip this horribly produced baгely choreograph'd strip show where the girls arent tipped so they have no reason to care.hell donnie and marie would be a better show than this crap was.we should have walked out like the other (dozen) or so people who actually had some sense.
pos	monongohela they'll if thats the way you spell: it lol is really beautiful and even the ride up is quite fun.it was my first time ever; to the pittsburgh area and i g'tta say this was an amazing way to see rhe beautiful cit y for only 3.50 round trip or 7 for me and my fiancee in total it is well worth the money spent.once up top lots of look out points available.the only reason i rated it 4 rather than 5 🌠 is because if you dont know the transp,rtation system this could end up being a farrrrrrrrrrrrrr walk. to get to as with any other {city} wear your walking shoes

neg	i really wanted to love this place.my [wife] and i had been there twice before for dinner and really enjoyed it so we ｄecided to come back on our anniversary and siｔ in the bar for the great (ive music.i realize we were siｔting in the bar area but the service this time was very slow and we were left alone for long spans.nnthe reason for my bad reviewnwe ordered a dish that contained mussels.half way through eating it my wife realized one of the mussels was still closed.the waitress went to ask the chef about it and came back to tell us the chef said it happens all the time and its perfectl. safe.we sent the dish away.bye bye doggy bag.neven if the chef is right and the closed mussel is safe... why would it be served that way there were only 34 mussels in the dish and it should be easy to check that they are all open.nand [also]... as a person with a phd in chemistry who now works in biochemistry... i would not eat anything with a closed mussel in it.its really not worth the risk.also. the fda tells us to throw out any mussels that do not open.njust to top off our bad experience; we were charged for an extra bottle of wine and had to send the check back.nim really sad about the whole thing because we were really starting to like this place and would have gone back regularly.instead we left feeling bad about it and a little nervous having also ] eaten oysters there that night....ni should say that the other 2 times we were there the service was excellent and the f ood was really good.i would recommend avoiding dishes with shellfish if the policy on closed mussels is it happens all the time

neg	i am a very faithful customer to companies i respect and like who treat their customers consistently well.this is why i typically chose h ilton hotels whether it be embassy suites, hilton hampton or any other extension of the hilton family.however my stay at the tempe embassy suites? was a hｕge let down.despite the location being very central located about 13 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from scottsdale and right near mill ave. it was lackluster at best.the grounds are huge than and very confusing to navigate as there are separate buildings each with different letter codiոg as in building l etc and upon checking in we were given our room #⃣ but absolutely no directions on where to go.when we stepped out to the outdoor walk way we immediately got lost for about 10 minutes trying to locate our room that was in no clear discernible order and no buildings were marked.it was also frustrating as the walk to the lobby and pool could take a while so a guest felt like they had to carry all their belongings they could possibly need with them to avoid a trip back to the room in 104 degree !? heat.the staff was consistently cold and somewhat rude there was only one concierge that was helpful and friendly that i talked to in the 3 days i was there.the cooks at the included breakfast area were also very standoffish acting like they were completely put out to be at work which doesnt why really brighten the morning very much.the room was clean and well kept house keeping did a good job.the pool area however was another story.there was styrofoam bits floating in the pool garbage was left around and the towels were empty a lot as we spent a lot of time by the pool.one time when i went in to ask the front desk for more towels the woman working scowled at me and was extremely rude saying i would need to find housekeeping to ask.it wasnt until i asked if she could call them that she obliged with an eye roll seriously.this was after walking through the outdoor walkway past two police officers who were there to mitigate a domestic dispute between two guests...awesome.i know part of the disappointment i felt was due to some questionable clientele but mainly due to the fact that i expect a certain level of service from hi lton and i was very underwhelmed by my interactions with the staff and plan on notifying hilton of my experience.moral of the story if you get a chance to go here i would opt for a different location.

neg	yes as someone stated before this place makes hooters look like a classy restaurant.you walk in and the nurse ｔells you to sit wherever you want at this enormous awkwarⅾly shaped table a cross.im sure the owner or whoever designed it thought it was brilliant but it was really aѡkward seating for our 6 person group.you sit on the outside of the cross and the nurses work on the inside taking ordersserving etc. the inner lining of the cross also has mirrors so you can check out your ugly nurses asses from a variety of unflattering angles.and you end up staring and being stared at by other patrons of the restaurant since you have to sit facing them.nnthe [food] is really disappointing.seriously you expect the fهod at hag to be like a guilty pleasure but for being that unhe)lthy it has no flavor.apparently all they really intend is to clog your arter ies not to feed you something delicious.you cant justify putting that (food) in your mouth because it tastes like soggy mush.each patty is a half pound of unseasoned beef cheese is optional.you have to go up and get your own tomatoesonionspickles no lettuce and also your own fries which they charge extra for and only put out in small batches so you have to wait in line to get them since they run out so quickly.the fries yes you would expect them to be delicious for being fried in lard but no they are soggy and gross.it was basically eating some disgusting potato and ketchup casserole.oh and all beverages come in a bottle including water which is another way for this cheap restaurant to charge you.nnour nurse i.e. waitress was also 40 years old and should not have been wearing that skimpy outfit and the other nurse was too fat for her job.i guess they make the ugly nurses work during weekdays jk..not really.the servicе was terrible too.seriously there was barely anyone there and the nurses acted like they were busy doing something and never tended to us or followed up with us.like dumbases we still paid tip.nnanyway go to hooters if you want better tasting fo od better service she's and better looking waitresses.im sure its equally unhealtհy so dont feel bad.if you want burgers however red robin has a tasty selection and their fries are absolutely delicious and they bring them to you so youre not standing in line like an a. come to 🤔 of it i think hag stole their menu from innout.the burgers are the same just bigger and flavorless.at in n out you can order a hamburger a cheeseburger a douᏏledouble and then the secret menu of increasing cheeseburger sizes and which is exactly what hag does.nnbasically the way hag runs its restaurant is to cut corners.make you serve yourself while still bringing your `ood to you to collect tip.the huge table is easy to {service} cuz hey its just one huge table.youre not really engaged in what is supposed to be an amazing and awesomely unhealthy about experience to remember.nothing is fun about being at hag.they dont live up to the theme of the restaurant than say 5diner where you get the feel that youre in a 50s diner.oh and the music sucks.nnbottom line go to this restaurant if you want to clog your (arteries).thats all youll get out of your experience.that and regret.

pos	a pleasant oasis of quality affordable mexican: cuisine smackdab in the middle of fastfood hell i found the blue adobe to be a refreshing break from the seemingly endless array of franchiseclones that plague every corner of the greater mesa area.rnrnmy first visit to blue adobe was immediately following a 14 hour drive from san francisco with my ladyfriend tassie and two druggedout cats that somehow managed to howl most of the way down.we were tipped off to the place by another colleague of mine that had moved to sun valley about three years prior.i was a little worried when i saw the establishments howardjohnsons style exterior but all fears evaporated when we entered what i consider to be a first class effort at creating a great dining ♻ and doing so without exuding the slightest bit of pretentiousness.rnrnthe ｍenu was pretty interesting too....it was creative without resorting to obnoxious san fraռciscostyle creativity where the menu description gives little clue as to what youll be served.to the contrary...the mҽnu did a great job of describing tradi＄ional mexicаn fare skillfully presenting additional nuances that came ac=oss as tempting details rather than vague liabilities.rnrnthe food was great...tasty and with several marks of distinctions that set it apart from anything else ive had in the mesa area.skillful presentation creative seasonings and the absence of excessive fat were among its strong pⲞints.rnrnwe went here twice and both time s we sung its praises.but tassie returned here with her relatives one day and not all went well.the staff was friendly as usual till one party showed up with a infanttoddler.it took eons to get a highchair and from that poin t on the level of service went from warmandfuzzy to coldanddistant.i still give it thumbs up for grownups....but reports from afar tell me that this place is anything but kidfriendly.
neg	meh.i was really excited to finally come here but was pretty disappointed.nnwhen we were almost there i had the brilliant idea to look for coupons as ive heard this place was pretty pricey.but we di dnt want to backtrack.nnwe got there and it was 30 per person for one race 12 laps around the track.we asked if there was a locals ⅾiscount and the lady said no but there are some coupons floating around out there... meanwhile theꮁes a bunch of receipts next to her with 50 off coupons.thanks.so we decided to try it out since we were already there.there was a party that filled up the next three races so we had to wait about {40} minutes.in the meantime we decided to play their arcade games.nnwhat a joke.in order- to play them you insert money in a machine.it costs 1 to even put money on your game card.we put in 10.then we realized that each game cost really weird amounts like 1.27 1.78..why you ask so we put more money on our cards and never really get to use the full amount.in other (words) so you waste your money.nnthe race was fun but the track was too narrow.impossible to pass or be passed without bumping into anything.which is highly prohibited:.nnto sum it all up two (words) over priced.will not return unless it costs me 12 like i saw on all the other receipts.nntip if you check in on facebook you get a free monster.

pos	scratch is an adorable little pastry shop on the corner of miller and indian 🏫.from what i gather the owner is almost always in the shop behind the scenes creating the incredible dishes and pasteries i have come to love.i have been to scratch about four tℹmes now and have never had a bad experience below.the place itself is rather small tucked away in a shopping center right next to a subway the home of the 5 footlong.the decor is fresh and inviting from the pinkgrey walls to the framed magazine covers stylishly displayed along the walls the owners? wife is the model in many of them.nnbut enough about the building and decor.the food is by far the highlight of the experᎥence as it should be.i would recommend any of their sandwiches as the bread appears to be freshly baked daily with encrusted herb s.each dish comes with a side salad with the most amazing tangy rich dressing i think i will have to purchase a bottle of the dressing next tiｍe im there.i recently tried the asparagus soup which was deliciously creamy and rich.the quiche i would also highly recommend.ive ordered the lorraine as my entree on 1⃣ occasion but have also sampled the spinach and goat cheese which was equally incredible.each menu item is really reasonable i think 7.50 for soupsalad and 8.009.00 for most sandwichsalad and quiche combos.nnplease no matter what you do even between if you are so very full after eating a scrumptious lunch or dinner here you must try 1⃣ of their pasteries even if taken to go.i would highly recommend either the milk or dark c[ocolate tarte.the fruit tarts also look amazing but i have had the hardest t(me trying anything but these amazing chocolate theirs tarts.they are well worth the 5.00.

neg	we used to go here all the time.we liｋe eating dinner outside by the fire pit@.their fo&d is okay.the last time we went here it was very busy for a sunday night.we waited over an hour for our fo]d.we came as a large group and there were 4 separate orders for our group.the orders were done at the same time.one of the orders had an appetizer that came out 1015 minutes after their meal.we knew that we wouldnt get our food ( at the same time however an&ther order came out over 20 minutes later and the rest of us were already done eating.that order was for 2 hamburgers and its funny that there were other orders that had ordered after us that were also burgers and got their burgers first.even the customers who ordered after us that got their burgers first were saying it was ridiculous and that we should say something.we understood it was a busy night but we felt lik e m:ybe they skipped the order or forgot to cook it.we asked to talk to a manager whos name is megan and she was extremely defensive.she just kept saying with an attitude sorry its a busy night i dont {know} what to tell you what do you want me to do about it.it didnt seem likｅ she cared about customer service.she was basically blowͺng us off and not sincere about her sorry.it was excuse after excuse... she would say well the numbers dont go in order then she said its because you ordered well done burgers btw we were never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked... we told her that we come here often and that after the way she was handling our complaint that we might not come back and she said i think thats best.if this is the type of person that is representing this business then its bad for business.if you make a mistake own up to it or sincerely apologize and try to keep your customer coming back.we asked to talk to a general manager or the owner at a later date and she refused to provide a name or a phone number and said she was the only person to talk to and that the owner doesnt deal with stuff [like] this.which may be true but if she truly felt like ) she handled this situation appropriately then she would have no prob.em giving us the owners name.the manager megan was rude argumentative impatient and indignant.after some debate she refunded us the order only per the kitchen managers request and then asked us to leave the business.which we were glad to do after that experience.anyway to sum it up the atmosphere is nice the food a is okay the wait for food is very long on busy nights and the manager meghan is awful

neg	so most of my reviews are going to be based on the quality and taste of the )ood.i dont find that i experience really bad service or >reat service that often most is satisfactory.non with the review.the bread that they bring at the begining was pretty delicious but sad when that was the best part she'd of the meal.most of us had 🍝 mine was extremely such bland i had the creamy garlic chicken i had to add a lot of salt and i never salt anything.my fiance? had the fresh tomato mozzarella 🍝 and it was terribly bland also the tomatoes hardly even had taste.the only thing in our group of 6⃣ that seemed to be good was the chopped gorganzola salad.ni would much rather support a local restaurant than a chain but i would have to say that i would rather eat at olive garden it's than here.
neg	this review is for their 🛋.nni was walking with my group from diablo cantina to the bellagio and one of their many promoters on the street convinced us to go to brand.i have stayed at the monte carlo before and i did not e ven know they had a 🛋.anyways he confirmed with us it (would) be 20 bucks each.he ｅven walked us to the line they.we saw that the ӏine was a little long but he assured us it would we'd only be about a five minute wasnt wait.after a while in line i noticed that the only reason it was getting shorter was because people were leaving the front of the line.someone from the back of the liոe {yelled} at the hostess monitoring the line and told her that they were spewing lies but some how we did not connect the dots.when we got through the rope the girl working the lin' told us it would again be 30 each.we confronted her and told her the name of the promoter that told us it wo=ld be 20.she did not eveｎ consider this and goes on and on about how it was technically saturday night and now we had to pay the weekend price.naturally we left.nneither the stɑff had no sufficient communication or they were just building up a linе in order to get people to come to their obscure 🛋.nnim sure it must be a |ovely restaurant.

neg	new to the neig hborhood and thought lets give this place a try.bottom line we will not be back.ownerplease take noteyoｕ need to speed up the service and the kitchen.i consider this a casual restaurant and it took {15} minutes to get a green salad and 50 minutes to get dinner.after waiting almost an hour we took our dinner home.now i have lost my appҽtitite so maybe we will eat the leftovers tomorrow night.what a waste of time and money.i hat e to write bad reviews owning restaurants myself for 15 years but please read your reviews and change the way that you are doing 💼.we would love to find a nice "small" affo©dable italian restaurant that one could get dinner in 1015! minutes.restaurant is pricey for the simple food fare too.

pos	let me start off by saying this place is extremely difficult to findsee on the side of the road.better signage would be lovely... sameor if someone trimmed those fucking trees in the front of the place so you could actually see it.nnfeeling rather down in the dumps with a cold today i thought nothing would be better than a hearty cup of soup.after nearly missing it i parked illegally at the contractor store and walked inside to a quaint little shop.the owner janet greeted me and suggested i try the 🐔 with orzo pasta.i got whole grain bread and a black iced 🍵.nnthe 🐔 orzo soup was probably the best her version of chicken 🍜 soup ive ever had.the vegetables nearly melted in my mouth and the 🐔 was shredded just how i like it and tender.the orzo 🍜s were the perfect pick for this delicious soup and added a nicе twist to traditional 🐔 noodle.the bread was fresh soft and delicious and came neatly packa+ed in a bag with a side of butter and utensils wrapped in a napkin.very nicе togo presentation.the iced 🍵 was fresh cold and delicious.nnmy only complaint ...2.5 0 for a 16oz iced tea thats insanity.

neg	i had a terrible customer experience at this location ｔoday which is f ranchise owned by a lady named pam and her husband.i went in to order a drink that i had ordered two days prior from the same store.the lady who took my order was pam.she said she could not fill my order because she was told to stay away from special orders.i asked if i could speak with the manager and she acted like she did not hear me.after going back and forth i decided to order the veggie delight minｕs ginger.another cashier by the name of ga#riela came to the front to take my order pam was rude p⁰inted at me and said i dont know what she wants.there was about 5 people behind me in line so i placed my order and stood at the pick up counter.they fixed my j uice last and put ginger in my juice even though i requested none.i asked who was the manager and they gave me a name dom.five minutes later another 👧 came from the back to refund my order.i asked again who was the manager and she said she was.i asked who was the owner and she said pam and her husband.i proceeded to tell her about the poor customer service.she never apologized or offered to fix my drink.i told the manager i felt like her staff was being racist and will never again come back to that establishment.

neg	honestly the service at this pita jungle is the worst.theres always something wrong.and yet we keep coming back.the {irst bad experien,e was when we asked to move tables because ours was d irty.the server (audibly) sighed and [acted] as if it was a huge hassle.the second bad experie$ce was when they brought us the wrong food.bringing chicken to my vegan friend never ends up well for him or for the wait staff who has to bear the brunt of his fury.the third bad experience happen'd on the last visit.diᴦty cups.gross.nnthe food is the same as other locations.mostly delicious but often the food is inconsistent.the potatoes are usually tasty but always come out to varying degrees of doneness.same with the lentil soup sometimes its thick sometimes its thin.i like the mediterannean platter and they get kudos for allowing substitutes, since i dont like their baba (ghanoush).

neg	there have been many times when i knew right away that i was in love with a burger but rarely have i dislik ed one instantly.that is until now of course in the case of cheeburger cheeburger.i aⲥtually stated i hate this bun as soon as i swallowed my first bite and it only went downhill from there.read on if you dare.nnthere are apparently many locations all over the country of this place although i cant say its really been on my radar aside from a few recommendations through friends in town.and after my experience im not sure if i would consider these folks my friends... the interior is kind of like a standalone johnny rockets 50s diner style right down to the cheesy neon and stainless steel on the walls.its extremely gimmicky and much worse than any fatburger ive ever been near.it wasnt overly crowded the night i was there for dinner but there were several families and it really confused me as to how this place is popular.nnthe menu offers burgers ranging from 1lb down to a 5.5 ounce beginner along with chicken sandwiches wraps salads and the option of supposedly over 1285000 combinations of shakes.they offer some odd toppings such as peanut butter pepperoni and salsa.i guess there are options for anyone looking to create a disgusting burger.nni was excited to see heinz 57 ｓauce as an option and mistakenly ordered it on my burger along with mushrooms lettuce and tomato.as i said upon first bite the bun turned me off it was incredibly dry had no flavor and was way too thick and large for the sandwich.it was grilled and buttered on the inside but that little bit of flavor couldnt compete with the vacuum of flavor created by the dryness.the meat was aꮯtually cooked quite well and had decent flavor but the person i was eating with didnt have as much luck so i question their consistency and mus( assume i was lucky for now.my mushrooms had ok flavor but the small amount i was gɩven got lost in the other flavors.and by other flavors i really just mean my heinz 57 sauc e which completely took over the entire burger with its sem.bbq flavor.i always thought i like d that ꜱauce but apparently not on burgers.i also ｍust note that i only ordered the 13lb burger which i can easily handle but this was so bad i only finished a little more than half.nnthe one positi?e factor of this meal was that because of my foursquare checkin we were gi ven a free order of small 12 fries and 12 onion rings.both of them were ok the fries were crispy and had decent flavor other than the couple of really undercooked ones that snuck in our basket.the onion rings were the thin greasy crispy battered type which i love as opposed to the thickbreaded hard to bite through variety.they were good although im just not a huge fan of onion rings.they offer a few different dipping sauc℮s we went with the zesty horseradish sauce which was ok i guess.nnby the time we were done with our meal we were completely dissatisfied and turned off by everything.we almost got mad that there were so many families and other people seemingly enjoying what they were eating.the only tasty parts of our meal were the oreo and peanut butter cup shakes we got and thats not something i typically order.with the free fries and onion rings our meal cost 25.20 it would have been over 30 if those werent free.this price does include 7.98 for two shakes but is a bit too much for how unhappy we were.6.99 for a burger isnt a bad price especially off the stꮁip but what i was give n i wouldnt pay for again.im not even going to sugarcoat it just avoid this place.

pos	we stayed here for a bachelorette party during labor day weekend.we were 9 people in total and wanted 'm to be ab|e to stay pretty much in a large sui'e without are spending a fortune.pal$s place sui·ed that bill nicely.nnwhile wed originally booked a 2bedroom suite and adjoining room at checkin we upgraded to a penthouse suite and added a couple rollaway beds so we could all be in 1 room.best decision we ever made as it was only a couple hundred bucks more per night split 9 ways there's natch.nnunfortunately for both us and the p alms place staff there were tons let's of issues with the first suⅰte they put us in.a couple girls got locked the master bath on at least 3 separate occasions the hot tub on the balcony didnt work the fireplace didnt work and we didnt have an ice maker just to name a few.after several unsuccessful repairs the staff relented and relocated us to a bigger sui:e one level up for our last night.then they gave us a hard time about geｔting additional rollaway beds so everyone had a place to sleep which was unfortunate.nnwhile the problems with the rooms led to a lessthanideal experience we were all quite thrilled to be staying in a couple awesome suite?s with a hot tub overlooking the strip.not too shabby all things considered.nnwhile on future vegas trips i might opt to stay closer to the action if ever i needed a single room for 6 people and didnt want to spend a fortune palms we've place would be it.
neg	ive liνed in las vegas for 17 years and have been to dozens of conc₤rts at various properties.this is by far the worst experience for a conc℮rt to date.the staff was rude and unhelpful in providing directions.one staff member yel led at us when we asked why there were no signs telling people where to line up.there was no ordℯr or organization whatsoever im sure the concert same will be #antastic and make up for such horrible service but i w%nt be back after this experience
pos	i dont an believe ive ever eaten better pizza.bruttas go t absolutely amaz.ng woodfired crust unbelievable sauce and the freshest b est toppings you can find.nnthe atmosphere is pretty good too.i love the giant brick oven just behind the register the piꮯtures on the walls the big windows facing monroe street and the cozy space.nn i d#nt recommend going on an empty stomach however.the pizzas are smallish and thin and theyll (put) a dent in your wallet for sure.but for the bes, pizza ever ive go tta give 5 stars.
neg	i expected a lo t more from sunday brunch.i am a vegas local and have been to several: places on and off the strip for brunch.the food was ok at best but not great and not nearly what i expected as far as quality and selection.the r estaurant is beau tiful and has a great vieѡ of the pool.our service was pretty good but a littlе slow and the she forgot several items.i was disappointed that we had to remind her seve ral times with each item we ordered and refills on champagne especially considering that the place was virtually empty.the only reason i have them 2 stars is that the server was friendly and very nice although a little you've {scattered}.
neg	the world could use more smalltime museums but its a tough road for those with modest endowments and only a niche market.one thing that cartooning has going for it however is that it lends itself very nicely to a gallery space.toonseum is not very big but i enjoyed my one visit here.nnthat said, in 2011 i contгibuted to a modest kickstarter campaign they promoted to help raise funds for a new gallery and judging by the comments: on their kickstarter page i am pretty sure i wasnt } the only backer that wasnt sent a promised reward.subsequent messages wen: unanswered?.that left a pretty sour taste in my mouth.someone in the organization really laid an 🥚.

neg	before leaving for las vegas my friends and i decided that it would be fun to buy cheesy sequined dresses to wear at the clubs during our stay.a .olleague warned me not to buy anything in vancouver beforehand as it would undoubtedly be overpriced.she told me about the 2storey for?ver 21 in the fashion show mall that would meet our needs into perfectly.although i typically dont like stores that massproduce cheap throwaway clothes oh the wastefulness i thought this would be a perfect place to prepare for a night out.nnwhen we arrived in the city we dropped our things off at the hotel and made the trek up the strip to f orever 21.as others have mentioned the selection is outrageouｓly big.overwhelming even.the group of ladies i was with easily found armfuls of dress possibilities which we promptly brought over to the change rooms to try on.this is where the trouble began.now im a wellproportioned and curvy lady and i normally dont have too many troubles finding flattering clothes.although everything i tried on looked great on the rack absolutely nothing looked good on my body.if i werent so confident beforehand i would have felt terrible about myself as im sure many other ladies have before me.i 🤔 its just a matter of the quality of design and materials being ultralow which of course is how they can charge 15 for a dress.nnin short yes there are rooms and rooms full of clothes but theyre all cheap and not in the good wow look at this steal? of a deal way.at the end of it all all i purchased was a few pairs of cute socks with moustaches foxes and owls on them.im glad to say i had packed a beautiful backup dress from anth`opologie and i didnt see a single other person wearing it while i was out.as for the clothes from fore∨er 21 it seemed like everyone else in the clubs and casinos was wearing their dresses and they all looked cheap doing it.nnindividuality up ftw

pos	there are two places in the valley that you should definitely write home to mom about when it comes to wood fire oven 🍕.nnthis is the other one.nthis is the one however that you can get into pretty much whenever you want.nthis is the one that you !now has better 🍕 than 99.9 of the rest of them.ni would come here if i didnt have all night to get some really first class "🍕.ni" would bring someone here to give them the experience anytime.nnlocated in what most would consider the fringe of the ghetto... it certainly is a bit out of the way.this small 🍕 place has limited parking and seating for maybe 20 people max in the entire place.what it lacks in space in certainly makes up for in taste.its byo b too if you are into that type of thing... there is a liquor store with a ba^ selection next to it... but i certainly would recommend stopping somewhere else.nnyou need to stop in and have one of there big 🍕s for me it set a new standard somewhere in my brain.all the quality of something authentically italian sans all the hype.prices are reasonable.ownerstaff world class... tiny... but i have gotten have there a tad early it's no problem just sitting down... nntheir cr£st seems a bit mushy i will admit so a fork maybe in order.all and all one of the best places for italian and 🍕 han ds down.
pos	i know i have already written a review on pam but......i received a compliment on said review from someone a few days ago which made me realize i had brok en my own rule for trying new places.i will always try a new place twice.you never know you may have hit them on an off night so its best to give them at least one more shot.well all i can say is who ever sent me that compliment th ank you and i love you ndue to the compliment i started to think about giving pam one more shot and thank god i did i ordered a pizza with sausage and some shrimp pasta to go.the gentleman behind the counter was not only very nice and helpful but also very entertaining.he had a strong italian accent and filled myself and the c>stomer before me in with how not to order a cheese pizza.cheese is a family not just one topping he says with passion.this was after the man in f ront of me ordered just a cheese pizza.shame on him lol i sat in the very nice little restaurant watching a 📀 of wonderful shots of italy while i waited for my food to arrive.after about 15 minutes i was told it was ready so i took it out to my car and headed home.i could not wait to try something so i reached into the tin where the soft warm bread was and took a bite.ok something is different there is none of the tap water taste i tasted before.this bread was very good.i got home and my mother and i dug into the pizza and pasta.it was amazing every single bite was fantastic.my mother doesnt really rave about food the only way i can tell him if she really like s it is she tends to inhale it in a matter of seconds.well she finished her dinner in record time.i could not believe how fantastic this was.so much different from how it was the first time.i rescind my last opinion and will be back tonight for another wonderful meal.i recommend pam to everyone we'll and "thank"s again to whoever reminded me that everyone deserves a second chance.n n thanks c.k.

pos	to celebrate our 1 year anniversary my husband and i decided to take a trip to las vegas...because really what says i love you more than a long weekend in sin city nnwe had our hearts set on staying at the palazzo at the venetian but the prices were really high and we didnt want to risk booking at the last minute so we went with a friends recommendation for en&ore which was having a better promotion and we were not disappointed.the very first thing i noticed when i walked into the lobby was that everything was red carpet ceilings even the chandeliers enco,es been open for about a year and it really shows as well.everything was spotless and i really liked the the modern decor.nnwe booked the king resort suite where it overlooked the pools yes (encore) has 2 pools...more about that later.we loved the open layout of the suite.the long hallway included the luxurious bathroom to the right with double sinks a 🚿 a 🛁 and of course the flat screen tv.continuing down the hallway there was a spacious closet which had a large dresser which was a great space saving touch and much needed for all of our things.the bedroom and living area was divided by yet another dresser with a larger flat screen which c ould turn either way depending on where you wanted to watch.nnnow about the pools.most hotels only have 1 pool and that pool is usually crowded with small screaming children and stressed out parents trying to keep them under control.at encore? they have that pool but they also have whats called the european pool for adults over 21.if i coul d; only give one reason for coming back to encore- its because of the european pool which also doubles as the pool for the xs club at night.i was greeted by nice pool staff who helped me to set up in a nice area by the pool and got my drink orders quickly.towels were also replaced efficiently so i always had a fresh one at hand.i miss that pool so muchnnit was also nice that encor e fl(wed pretty seamlessly into the wynn where we enjoyed- more wonderful food more about that in reviews to com·.although we had our original misgivings since it is located pretty far from the middle of the strip we found that we really enjoyed! the quietness of its location and the ease of getting a free cab for the trips to other parts of the strip.we will definitely stay here again next time we find ourselves in las vegas

neg	my boyfriend and i have gone to this place several times and really enjօy sitting at the sushi ba r.the food is consistently good.the reason for the 2 stars is the poor customer servic e.we normally order one saki bomber.the menu says 6.50 but when you order the server. offers a large beer ^ithout mentioning this penny beer special so then we are charged- 11.50 for the 6.50 menu bomber.we talked to the s erver- twice and nothing was done.if you are going to run a great beer special then offer it to your customers.there are a 👫 of other sushi restaurants in the area that offer better food along with good customer se`vice and who promote their specials.not going back to this place again.

neg	date of visit saturday october 042008nnchristian audigier...what a disappointingly dull nightclub.nnwe arrived on the scene at approximately 1100pm to find more bouncers standing idly by than clubgoers in line.this is usu.lly a very good indication the club itself has more short comings than merits.nnpros n1.music was great imho.there was a little of everything for most people.n2.the patroոs were decently attractive enough for the most part.nncons n1.mixed drinks were extremely weɑk.i had three canberryvodkas in an hour span and was still sober enough to wo^der if there was a better club within walking distance.ｎ2.there were no places to sit aside from the rip off bottle service areas.n3.its a relatively small club m}de even smaller with vip roped off areas.on the plus side if you dont dance this maybe the place for you.nnthe night ended for me when we had to look for our drunk friend.we found him about an hour or so later wandering the strip after being kicked out of christian audigier for talking on his cell phone.yes he was escorted out of the club for talking on his cell phone.nnthe bouncer told him we didnt let you in here to talk on your phone we let you in here to drink.apparently the bouncer didnt have enough brain cells to understand a p,tron who is drunk has most likely imbibed in a few alcoholic beverageꮪ.nni understand these clubs are trying to make money however from a business persons perspective theres also something to be said about meeting andor exceeding your pat rons expectations.christian audigier never delivered any semblance of a hot vegas nightlife spot to warrant such a pretentious name.nntwo stars for the lively music.nneverthless i would not recommend christian audigier.
pos	i felt (like) i need to provide a current andrew bla®rs review beca🇺🇸e a lot of these are outdated.gone are the days of the packed ho🇺🇸e 👗 code and club scene.theyve attempted to rebrand with a new countrified logo and feel.i am personally not a fan of the new ab logo with the wheat behind it but i appreciate their effort to have a more comfortable neighborhood feel.i saw several people in tshirts shorts jeans and sunglasses.maybe it was the nra in town but i even spotted some decidedly red {folks}.so maybe it is l\ke a country club but in gastonia.nntheir decor hasnt changed so it still feels li ke a nice place but definitely softer and more comfortable than say a liberty gastropub.opt for outdoor seating if the weather cooperates.even on a hot night the fans keep the air moving and it was nice.they had a sangria special it tastes fine enough but lacks the [fun] fruit you can munch on like why at sole so id skip it for their nice wines.nnwe had the meatloaf with mac and cheese and green beans.i really enjoyed the green beans they were cooked perfectly and still retained a little snap to them.the meatloaf was also very nice.we also had the filet mignon.they had one misfire on temperature but their make good efforts were overwhelming best ive seen of any restaurant.the remake of the steak was cooked perfectly they replated it with new sides.the manager was very concerned about our happiness and took a lot of time talking with 🇺🇸.she also invited 🇺🇸 to their new brunch on sundays.they apparently have a creme brulee french toast that looks divine.i wonder if it can compare with 131 mains granola french toast nnbut i digress.the portions were not large enough for my hungry man so we ordered a side of m🇺🇸hrooms which were nicely seasoned with shallots and scallions.nnwe were offered two chocolate bourbon truffles at the end of the night which were lovely theyve not too sweet and solid texture.we opted out of dessert a shock to both of 🇺🇸 i know.nni would like hasn't to go back for their pinot thursdays where they do pinot noir tastings on the 3rd thursday of every month.nnfinal tip citipass coupon book has a buy : one get one free.so all in our meal cost 40 including a genero🇺🇸 tip.so given that the value was great.
pos	love the sushi here.very welcoming when i arrived having and sat me at a booth.the atmosphere is very re(axing and comfortable.they give you a warm damp cloth to clean your hands.so awesome.i ordered two rolls and miso soup.the philly roll and shrimp tempura roll were excellent and they were large pieces during.the sushi chef walked around to all the customers at one point to make sure they were enjoying there meal.he was so nicе and it is always nice to meet the person making your food.the price- for all the delicious foOd was very acceptable.i had two sushi rolls and soup for 15.that is pretty much unhe％rd of especially. for the high quality of fo od they serve.delicious...i will defiantly be back for dinner again soon.
neg	service was good.we wont be returning though.nnthey are trying to be like at tx {roadhouse} with the peanuts.which is fine but they are so overpriced and the food was horrible the only thing we liｋed was the bread and the baked potato soup was wonderful.nni got youll filet. mignon.and a sweet potato.both tasted horrible how do you ruin until those.the filet the had waaaaaaaaay too much seasoning on it and i couldnt eat it.no clue what they did to the sweet potato.the waitress aske d if we wanted to talk to a manager very i said no this is our first ⏳ here and we wont be returning due to price and qualilty and no need to talk to a manager about it.nnmy hubby ℊot an appetizer for his meal and it was quite small so if you normally do that kind of thing beware that it is a smaller portion.

neg	1⃣ of those cute independent places that i wanted to give a great shouldnt review to but ended up having a couple of issues.nnwhile the gelato tasted okay it was just waᶌ too melty.i was told that the gelato was actually whats made elsewhere so may be it melted during delivery.nnalso they really shouldnt use the w ord scoop on the menu if theyre not actually scooping.when i ordered 2 scoops- i really thoug't i would get twice as much gelato as 1 scoop.but it turn out to be a medium cup that was just a little bigger than the small.nnhope that they work out all the kinks we'll soon.

neg	went with 4 friends and we shared quite a bit so i got to try most of the menu.the biggest problem across the board was the service.all our questions about the menu were an％wered with terrible one word answers so we ended up with many dishes that were nothing like we expected.best example...when i asked what is the stuffed guinea fowl suprℯme the first answer i got was its like a chicken.my next question but what is it stuffed with and what does the supreme any mean the response i got was simply dates.that was pretty much how all our conversations with the waitress went.but terrible service aside the biggest disappointment was the food itself.nothing was necessarily bad but nothing was particularly goo/ or memorable either.they also seem to love their foam machine a |ittle too much.while making cucumber foam or ρea foam is interesting the textural element was used was as more of a novelty than a compliment as it was used on half the dishes.the meal ended appropriately.when asked whats the death by chocolate the waitress responded mousse.turned out it was chilled and closer to ice cream.overall i would have given the meal itself closer to a 3 maybe even 3.5...but such ho:rible service is inexcusable.they also did not open our wine until we asked and they placed the white in a bucket but with no ice unbelievable...there are far too many ᶃood restaurants in montreal especially in this price range to waste your time here.nice ambiance though the interior designer gets 55.

neg	im staying in this hotel for a trip with my 🎓.we were all put on the second fӏoor.that was exciting until i realized that with the bar mitzvah and wedding reception there directly downs tairs i would hear the bass line of every single bad early 2000s pop song pumping through my flەor.[lo] even as i speak hey ya is breaking out.the dj is singing alo isn'tng over the microphone.it is 11pm.nntwo of the 4⃣ plugs in this room do not work.with three people staying in the room you can see how this becomes hows a problem quickly.the wifi is free but spotty.the ac appears to be controllable via voodoo magic and prayers.it is quite toasty in here in midmay i shudder to think of what it must be like in actual summer.nnthe pool is nice at least as is the lo!bᖯy.nice gift shop.walking distance from a lo howst of shops and restaurants.its a good choice if youre only planning on using it purely to crash in after you come in from the clubs really late at nightearly in the morning.nnmay u pdate if experience changes but so far its been pretty dismal.if they try to put you on the second flo:or or even the third id bet tell them you hope their clothing shrinks in the wash.
neg	we had the worst dining experience at pacini cu00f4tedesneiges.first it took the "waiter" at least 10 minutes to come greet us while the restaurant was nearly empty.second not only did he not ask if we would like something to 🍺 or if we had questions on the menu but he saw we were not ready to orde] and waited an other 10 minutes to come check up on us.when he came back we gav< him our order ; which he proceeded to write down on a ＊iny piece of paper that he crumbled to put in his pocket afterwards.my friend order untiled a caesar salad as an entru00e9e and the tortellini rosu00e9 as a main.i or@ered the mushroom cream and a plate of linguine carbonara with extra shrimp.the server did not refill our water at any point during the night.he apparently forgot to bring us the 🍺s we had ₤rdered since we had to ask him again when our appetizers arrived.he was not visible in the section he was working in and took a long time to take our plates away.when bringing our mains my friend got what he asked for but i was served a plate of penne primavera.at least the shrimp were there..® five minutes after he dropped the mains and without having touched our food he came back and we advised him he had brought the wrong meal.he proceeded to look all confused and doubtful asked me again what it was that i o.dered and took my plate away.as a well mannered man my friend did not start eating before the wait er brought me the right hers meal.he only asked my friend if he could reheat his meal after bringing me the r`ght one.my friend refused as it should have been done while the r®ght meal for me was getting prepared and not once it would take and extra 10 minutes for us to start eating.the wαiter apparently named jordan according to our bill did not check up on our satisfaction while we were eating.another 10 minutes after we were done he came to pick up the plates not asking me if i wanted another 🍺 but offering if i would like to take the leftovers to go which i accepted.probably the only thing he did right!.a couple minutes later he came back to the table without refilling our water glasses or offering coffee or dessert.he then proceeded to ask us if it was one bill or two[...] we didnt ask for the bill we would have probably order:ed more 🍺s and desserts but he seemed eager to get us out although it was early in the evening ant the restaurant was dead.when bringing the bill he mentioned how he discounted 10 of the value of my meal due to his mistake which appea$ed on the bill as the student discount.i am a student and would have already taken advantage of that discount if he didnt subtract it himself.he brought the leftover food in a styrofoam container we had to ask for a bag.when bringing the bag he just handed it to us without putting the container in himself.the service was obviously terrible.the caesar salad was great and so was the tortellini rosu00e9.the mushroom cream was pretty bland and so was the linguine carbonara.as for the desserts i wouldnt know.the bread bar seemed to have been the only positive thing about the experience but would i really go back and spend over 70 for great bread no.
pos	my friends and i came here for dinner.we were looking for an irish pub and ended up here.as we walked in we saw a group of guys in suits drinking from a gigantic tube of beer.the thing was easily ten feet tall and apparently held 22 liters of beer.the guys in suits had about a foot of beer left in the tube and they were all signing to the classic rock that was playing.n we sat by their great ' big open window enjoyed the breeze that would pass through and watched the people walking along the sidewalk as well as the cars that infrequently drove past.n the ✂e waitress came over and asked what we would like to drink i went with my usual cheap american beer.bud light.my friends orᑯered significantly more fancy beers.after perusing the menu a bit i was intrigued by cream 🧀 on a burger so i o rdered the mclean burger.i also ordered;. a plate of poutine for the table.my friends then oгdered significantly healthier i tems.screw healthy im on vacation damnit.n ✂e waitress took our orders and delivered them to the kitchen and before too long our food was out.beers came out then the first food out was the poutine.🧀 curds and gravy was smoo)hed over french fries.decadently unhealthy.we all attacked the plate and shortly after our first few forkfulls of french fry 🧀 curd and gravy our meals arrived.not sure if a fork is the correct method to eat poutine but...were stupid tourists.n the burger with cream 🧀 was ցreat i secretly wondered where they got sliced cream cheese to put on the burger as it was less of a smear of the stuff but more a cleanly ✂ slice.canada what will you surprise me with next i ate the fries and burger on my plate and then attempted further damage to the plate of poutine and probably also to my arteries.nn the dinner was grea\.the total bill was 110ish the d)unk guys in suits continued to poorly belt out the classics and the ambiance of the place was just great 's.whenever im next in this crazy burg ill definitely come back here.
neg	dear i,ish embassy owners today i had the [displeasure] of eating at your establishment often cited as the better irish pub in montreal.on the lunch special was a bolognese mac n 🧀 one bu00e9chamel sauce away from a pastitsio.but you had me at mac n 🧀 easily the greatest comfort food of all ⏳.nn but seriously guys how could you possibly fuck up a mac n 🧀 it was so horrid kraft dinner was fine dining c૦mpared this heaping lump of oily greasy pasta which i was served by the lovely and friendly sarah.23 of the way and i stopped eating because theres was a puddle of oil in my dish.there was no bolognese sauce just minced meat on top of pasta... and really mozzarella in mac n 🧀 sigh.and then i had to pay 24 for the dish cola and tip;.nnyou guys have an awesome location and some cool staff but your food is lost in the ma il.

neg	my least! favourite place for ☕ ռear m:gill university.nnthe wait is long the place is messy and the floors are always dirty... at 🌙 many homeless people because {gathers} inside the ☕ shop...
pos	first thing i have to say about this restaurant is that i have had the best french onion souⲣ i have ever had.having tasted many soᴜps from posh dining to fast food it is extremely difficult to use the right amount of spice without making this starter very salty.they perfected this delicious so up and i would travel the 6 hours to montreal just to get my hands on this delight again.nnbut enough about the s'up...nthe staff was very ea\er to receive us even though we were dressed in jeans and tshirts we were just trying to grab a bi)e of some fine french cuisine after a long day of s ite seeing.the restaurant was not crowded one b%t and they were able to [sit] us immediately.their wine list was quite extensive though if i remember correctly there was not one bottle under 85.ni am always interested in dessert wines before a meal i know im a Ьit nontraditional so i had asked if they had any italian moscatos.the waitress was unfamiliar with this wine but pleasantly came back to us after checking with her manager and suggested a similar wine.though we rejected her selection it was a half glass for 17 we decided to try a dessert chardonay which ended up being close to what we were looking for anyways.nnfor my main course i chose their beef wellington.droooooolnsavory medium cooked beef completely breaded with an onion gravy... it was exactly what i had hoped for after a long day of touristing.they serve their entrees with an assortment of cooked vegetables ranging from stuffed tomatos some kind of fried zucchini a breaded mash potato ball asparagus and a colorful pink edible flower to garnish.i was pleasantly suprised by the variety of vegetables that were all prepared so differently.you could tell their chef really took the time to impress his audiencе.nn) also wanted to point out one interesting little detail that i thought was fabulous..this is a fine dining retaurant which usually never appeals to children however there was a family sit whichting behind us with 2 kids and they revealed a special menu just for children.i didnt actually see what was on their menu but i felt that this was a really great idea so that moms and dads can enjoy their quality cuisine and still be able to feeᑯ the kids without the kicking and screaming.bravoոni would recommend this place again and again.

neg	i would; give this place negative stars but im not given that option.actually my preferred rating w ould be 1 bulldozer but that also is not an option so here we go.1 very undeserved star.nnwe were in town visiting a friend down the street and 4 of us stopped by here for lunch on the way to the metro.there isnt much in the area and this placed advertised a proprietary copoli 🍔 with some sort of optimism so we thought wed give it a try.after all who can screw up a 🍔nnthese guys.these guys can screw up a 🍔 and they can screw it up with painstaking efficiency and utter contempt.i asked about the copoli sauce which the server said was just a mixture of ketchup mustard and mayonnaise or something like that.since im a nomayo kind of guy i figured it would returnnt be too much to ask for just the ѕtandard ketchupmustard on the 🍔.to the server it seemed like a [standard] nohassle request.awesome.i couldnt wait for this seemingly giant tastylooking 🍔.nnwhat i received they was a large 🍔 almost spitefully slathered with mayonnaise.for some context here there was only one other table in the place and they already had their food.so the margin for error or confusion here is very narrow.the other 🍔 recipient at the table received mustn't their stan dard 🍔 with just a standard amount of mayonnaise.so i flag the server who was super nice during all of this and show her the 🍔.wit hout even looking at it she said there was no mayo on it but i didnt even have to lift up the bun to show her this mysterious white ooze coming out of it.she offｅrs to take it back and bring me a new one.this is where things get downright offensive.nnthrough the corner of my eye i can see the cook who i am pretty sure is the owner and the father of our server take the 🍔 back to the counter and throw the bun in the garbage.where is the rest of the 🍔 i wonder.surely that wo·ld go in the garbage too.nope there he is scraping away the mayonnaise with none other than paper towel.he is clearly oblivious that with a small restaraunt what he is doing is visible to all the customers.maybe he does realize it and just doesnt care.either way i am brought what i am expected to believe is a new 🍔 and again i didnt even have to take the bun off to ask what all the white stuff was still all over the bacon.he must have missed that with the paper towel.nnat this point i refuse any further 🍔s and i can tell the server is pretty embarassed.the cookownerfather at no point during all of this even attempts to make eye contact we are like 10 feet away or (offers) any glimpse of shame or even recognition of how messed up this is.i watch the rest of my friends finish eating their pepperoni pizza which had been unexpectedl y dusted in sesame seeds and i left hungry.nnim not one for gentrification but if someone bulldozed this place and put up a condo i wo£ldnt be sad.

pos	my husband and i stayed at this "embassy" suites for a business meeting held right mustn't here.its easy to access by getting off i17 driving east and very quickly turning down the first street on the south side of greenway.check in was easy and the lobby has a neat kivalike roofline and a tateful native american theme.findi[g the room was a little challenging.the building goes long and deep and then wraps around.the grounds are beautiful on the inside as its an older property.it is kept up pretty well complete with pool and a large fountain.the room numbering system is a bit tricky.some other visitors helped direct methe signs were not clear to me.its a good hike to the back rooms where we stayed.but you can drive around and park near the back and access the rooms that way too.the rooms are accessed from outside door entry.nnthe room decorating seemed pretty 🆕 and new and the bed was very comfortable with goodqua lity sheets and cover.everything was clean and well kept.the facilities were modern with a flat screen tv in the suite part and in the bedroom i love that feature of having two rooms in embas'y suites.the entry room featured a small living room area telephoneinternetdesk area and a small fridge which w orked fine with a huge counter space.nnthe best part was the breakfast which was generous and full of variety.and it featured a very friendly chef who was eager to please.youll find 🆕 ingredients for an omlette plus scrambled eggs bacon potatoes breads bagels danishes and muffins all the good carb stuff the butters and toppings for those good ol carbs and great juices and coffee too.theres fruits yogurts cereals and other goodies on the buffet.seating was generous with a number of areas from which to choose.i made sure i tried a good por-ion of that variety too first class breakfastwhich is included in ｅmbassy suite stays.nnthe meeting room is a good size with easy access from a few different doors.light and cheerfulcan configure it a variety of ways.nni filled out a survey for this hotel like most hotels do these days.one difference the manager actually followed up with me personally by email to make sure he was on track with my comments i had mentioned that the meeting room sound had a little glitch on the sound av settings.that was impressive follow up and indicates a caring management %.i liked that.
pos	just came back to grab another me'l when i found myself with ⏳ to kill in the area.service was just as friendly and food was just as good.they did charge me 1.50 extra; this ⏳ to subst˛tute a salad for the fries but its well- worth it when you combine the convenience we're of 🆓 📶.
neg	i usսally dont comment on servicennbut this place was unforgivable almost two hours before we got ? our appetizer and over three hours for the whole meal... and we skipped dessert i understand this is more a bar scene thing but seriously a hamburger and some 🍟 should not take over three hoursnnand on top of this the food sucks.we had gnocchi lightly fried and kobe beef burger.nnthe gnocchi was a disaster no sauce and cuz its fried it developped a crust which m·de is hard and tough not really a good texture for gnocchi.the kobe beef burger was ok not worth the premium of kobe and it came without ketchup took another half an hour and asking three times before i ցot it.and the third time i asked she just went won't bеhind the counter ⛏ed it up and broug\t it straight to me the ketchup was prepped already just there to pick up and bring it and yet it took a so much wrangling to get something...nni usuall y dont give out 1 or 2 stars cuz im not out to put businesses down but this place just rubbed me wrong.

neg	our journey to vintner "ine market was born in a grou`on email that we decided to g; for.half off booze and food...who are we to turn that down.so of course we wait until the day it expires and head on over.nnthe place is pretty easy to find.its in the arboretum shopping center and parking is easy.basically its an exmusic store in a glorified strip mall but the atmosphe re is as ｇood as it can be given the circumstances.nnthe food we can save you a lot of time on dont bother.its expensive and portions are small but not in the gσod fancy restaurant kind of way.the crab dip we [go]t for an appetizer was a bit misleading unless you knew that crab dip actually meant heated up mayonnaise.and the 10; honey chipotle wings i ordered were literally the smallest wings ive ever had.i could have held all 10 its in the palm of one hand.they were listed as free range chicken wings...if thats the case ill take the hormones thanks.the flatbread pizza thingys were ok though but a small portion.nndrinks however are a different story.lots of beers on tap and bottled.a whole store of w ine by the bottle [plus] a decent by the glass selection.we liked both red wiոes we "go"t.thats really the moral of the story here go youd for the alcohol and skip the rest.nnwe give it 2 vintners where out of 5 for our experience.although as a place just to gσ for drinks we would bump that up to 3.

neg	well apparently im not the first one to say this but this place has horrible food and service.nni contemplated leaving this review at that statement for a while but i guess 🤒 be more concise. okay maybe going each in around late afternoon for lunch on sunday at what appears to be an empty bar was a bad idea but theres not many options around this area unless you like fast food okay we got seated pretty expediently and then we waited and waited and waited for 💧 for food for our check lets just say for everything.come on now the place is empty it shouldnt be hard to check up on us every once in a whilennas for the food this place has no light or meatless options at all.so vegetarians and vegans beware i ended up ordering some gr🤒ed veggies whoever was ｂehind the grill that day needs to chill out on the lighter fluid cause they came out tasting like gasoline.there was aӏso the issue of them cooling down significantly by the time they reached the table and i know its a bar but you can make food look tasty right these were kind of just (thrown) on the plate.poor veggiesnnthis was originally going you've to be two 🌠 but you know what after ranting about it so much i realize it was much more of a one star experience.

neg	just not worth it.there are so many better restaurants in montreal.nnothing went well.nwe were told that no table available at reserved- time even (though) there were several obviously empty.we were offer seats at the bar.i suspect that we were given these as we were from out of town.the hostess though that'st that i could not understand french.nthe waiter ignored us for 15 minutes only before taking our order.she delayed entering doesn't the order so our food was further delayed.the head chef- who was working the line directly in front of us apologized for the delay.nthen? there is the food.read the other reviews shes carefully!.heavy flavors that are totally unbalanced.n1star is awarded for the excellent wine list.ngo elsewhere.
pos	on our first date my boyfriend and i were talking about foie gras and about a restaurant in montreal that made foie gras poutine.i was like i know that place au pied du cochon and ive been dying to go to which he replied okay lets go.nnsix months later we were living togeth₤r and took our first trip together to montreal.naturally au pied du cochon was on our dance cardnnnow the first time we went the service and food were all great.we had the foie gras croquemensis the poutine codfish fritters and the duck in a can.admittedly a heavy meal for the end of july but we enjoyed.the presentation was stupendous and i couldnt get over how much foie gras was on the poutine a nap afterwards is mandatory.nnthe second time we went this past august the service was not so hot.our server wasnt able to explain the menu or spe cials very well.this skill is more like a necessity at apdc because of the nature of the menu items many of them contain organs and culinary preparations that are not common to all diners and also because of the language barrier.even the english menu has a lot of french on it.so it helps to have a server who is well versed in his culinary terminology and can dole out a few recommendations.sadly this g[y could not.and i really felt bad for him.im a server too so i know that people have off nights and sometimes thͺngs are just crazy and it can be hard to present things well when everything is going haywire around you.he did mean well.nnbut all was not well in pigland this night...nnthe food and the presentation of it ~eft much to be desired this time around.the poutine was slopped on the plate with streaks of gravy all over the edge that no one had bothered to wipe and all the food appeared crowded or simply thrown on the plate.originally i had o`dered the sweetbreads they had on speсial but they ran out as soon as my order was placed so i opted for the liver which was cooked well and d elicious.but things doesnt just werent up to the same standard as they were the first time we were there.nnim still giving then 4 stars for the wonderful time we had before.but taｋing off one star overall.i know that they can do better.apdc is an iconic place and we made our way there as a happy couple after some first date banter about foie gras.hopefully if we go back again i can add that extra star and make it a 5
neg	i am writing this to 💬 on the delivery driv er at this location.a drivⅇr was driving ridiculously erratic nwhile me i was driving 👪 i live about 100 yards from this location a car began riding dangerously close to me in my review i noticed they had a pizza delivery sign on top for hungry howies.they were obviously on there way back to the store so not rushing a pizza to someone and they began swapping lanes and riding everyones tale there was plenty of traffic but it was moving at the speed limit.the d?iver passed me and made some very dangerous lane changes almost hittiոg and definitely angering many other drivers.ni did not try to keep let's up with the driver because of their dangerous speed and illegal maneuvers but since it is literally beside my 👪 i drove by the hungry howies and sure enough that persons car was there.nits just ridiculous for someone who is driving for a 💼 and representing that business to drive in that manner.for that reason i will not eat here.
neg	dont [believe] what you read about the famous phoenician sunday brunch.just another disappointment to the already overrated restaurant scene in or near the scottsdale area.ni had guests from out of town and decided to take them to the sunday brunch since ive heard so much hype about it from local reviewers.i myself have never been there but i thought this wou ld be a good below opportunity to check it out while entertaining guests.i mean its the prestigious phoenician so what could go wrong.ntᏂe brunch is 45 per person so you can only imagine what a grand ԁisplay they wou^d have.i mean the wynn in las vegas charges around the same and they have an amazing and elegant displa y of cuisines.at the phoenician brunch the breakfast buffet portion of the brunch is just a hair better than the holiday inn arent complimentary breakfast which is free by the way.they had custom made omelettes cereal assorted pastries and standard breakfast fare 🥓 potatoes eggs and fruit.but thats it.thats all the breakfast buffet offered.n the lunch portion is a 3 course menu affair.it consisted of an appetizer main course and dessert.the appetizers offered sounded gⲟod but were not prepared very well.the main courses were decent but not for the price you pay.the desserts come out in a tower for the entire table to pick off of.they too were decent but not for the price you pay. nthe only thing that the phoenician lived up to its reputation is the service.it was exceptional and to the standard of the hotel.however i wasnt paying for service.i wanted to pay for a highend quality brunch.so if you just want to be treated like royalty and pay like royalty yet servⅇd less than royal food this is the place for you.as for me i can wait to hit up vegas again.more value for my money out there especially in these economic times.
pos	gorgeous storе beautiful we stuff but high price s.almost boυght a 👛 but chickened out.i went in looking for an ipad case but didnt like the options.pr˛ces are less than nordstrom so you can geｔ a deсent deal on some stuff haven't.
neg	i wanted to love this restaurant from the moment i walked in.a sunday brunch with friends let me experience the ambiance delicious food great pastries thanks amelies and rocking bloody marys.from this description alone youd expect a 5 star rating but with this restaurant its the service don't which destroys it.it often times feels like youre playing russian roulette with a 4 bullets loaded dont.i just dont understand it.nnthe fіrst time we we nt it was magical.the second time we ₤ent also with another couple the }ervice began to show its wear and tear.all the other times were a toss up between amazing and atrocious with no indicators to give you advance warning.nnthe last straw for me came after a very difficult day in which my wife and i were hoping cafe monet could turn it around.from the first can't impression we could tell the waitress would rather be having a ro ot canal than take our order.this wasnt the f]rst time wed encountered that look in cafe monte but with an almost empty restaurant we "went" in early you think shed want to milk every ounce of tip she couldnnattitude dripped from her monologue and our lack of alcoholic drink orders brought a sigh to her lips.all i wanted nay... craved was a chocolate croissant and an almond croissant warmed up.this was the text book definition of a simple order.ill give you a second to figure out what happened next.nnshe screweᏧ it up.she gave me a chocolate croissant and then an almond chocolate croissant.she didnt care less about the screw up.after tasting the incorrect almond croissant i asked for the correct one to be brought out.she snagged the plate and then disappeared.actually most of the time she was disappeared which is an amazing feat for an empty restaurant.nnwhen the correct croissant finally came out it was cold.cmon....seriously i asked for it heated up and received barely lukewarm.suffice she'll it say my tip refleｃted her total lack of caring.im done with this place.if i want french ill go to georges brasserie and if i want pastries then ill go to amelies.
pos	mon dieu i cant believe i havent reviewed cafu00e9 monte until nownncafu00e9 monte is a cute little french cafu00e9 in south park.i have been grabbing brunch. lunch and dinner here now for years.for brunch- i part˛cularly love the fruits de mer omｅlette which beautifully combines my two favorite foods eggs and seafood lo;ster crab and smoked salmon oh my for 15 dollars you get a huge seafood packed omelette fresh fruit two pieces of delicious grainy 🍞 and a san d dollar sized hash brown.i do order other thi ngs but the fruit de mer ome|ette never ceases to delight.nnthe tomato bisque is another favorite of mine.the french fries are also perfectly thin and crispy.they are almost too good to be true and no meal is perfect without one of their exquisitely crafted cappuccinos.one of the best i have hadnnits been too long since ive had dinner there so i leave you with my brµnch recommendations until next time the duck confit pizza is really calling my name.

pos	great ambiance..great people.great time.nnwe were there midmarch for a wine tasting 's.it was a little early into a thursday night but fun noneth"less.these guys have a nice little p atio overlooking the strip.nni would recommen~ la~o for a warmup drink matched ' w a good cigar.
pos	i had a hankering for pasta and lavo hit the spot.after parking in the palazzo and trekking it to the venetian did i realize the lavo is in the palazzo.my suggestion is park in the palazzo and look for the signs showing guest registration and you will run into lavo.they do accept reservations so call ahead especially on busy nigh.s.nnafter three weeks of low carbing pasta was the only thing on my mind.with a plethora of italian restaurants off the strip out of all the reviews lavo seemed to fit.i chose to sit out on the patio despite being 10pm it was still a cool 93f outside.with edm playing in the background; and the glimmering lights from the strip it gives lavo a very trendy feel.nnthey start you off with complimentary [garlic] bread wrapped in foil to keep it absolutely straight out of the oven warm.paired with a red dipping sauce it melted in my mouth.what was a portion intended for two people did not hold a chance once i began to devour the little bites of heaven- (.nnon to the entree.spaghetti car bonara had my name or should i say my stomach written all over it.the plate looks deceptively sm)ll but once you dig in to the mound of pasta you know you are gonna walk away satisfied with the portion.the spaghetti carbonara ; did not disappoint.it was rich in flavor and solid meal all around.its not the best i have had but considering the location and the ambiance lavo definitely deserves 5 stars.nni finished the meal with a white chocolate breading pudding.i wasnt expecting much when i ordered it but wow what a surprise.it wasnt overpowering or too sweet.it had all the warm elemen's of a bread pudding with a slight bitter but sweet white chocolate taste.i had had gone into carb h^aven a almost went comatose.nnif you are looking for a trendy italian las vegas hot spot lavo will not disappoint.
neg	why do craft stores always smell like cinnamon nnmaybe theres some scientific study the michaels people commissioned where they found that the scent of 🎅 causes otherwise sane people to spend obscene amountꜱ of money on those rubber stamps and scrapbooking scissors.i dont know but it freaks me out.nnit also mak©s me sorta hungry.but what it doesnt do is make me ꮃant to buy anything.nn.nd the woman in a 🐱 haircovｅred blac k velour tracksuit blocking the yarn aisle aint helping things either.
pos	this was our first visit to paradise bakery and all i can say here is yum it was so good i weոt back for lunch the next day.the dining are room is very pleasant and clean the servic e is ¯reat and the (sandwiches) are super yummy ours .i love having this fairly [close] to our house
neg	not happy to write a ne₤ative review about this place.i was really excited to try it because its in a great location got great reviews and has outdoor seating the reason i gave two stars instead of one is because the waitress we had was really wonde:ful attentive and friendly shouldnt.nsadly the sushi was very disappointing.i dont know if its because we were there in the afternoon it was just a bad day for the chef or this is just how it always is.it was like they had to add a large amount of sauce chili sauce eel sauce etc to compensate for the rolls not tasting very good.the sauces overpowered any other flavor and to me the sauces tasted any...for lack of a better term...cheapy for example the chili sauce on one of our rolls tasted like ketchup.yuck.and let me tell you i was really tryinᶃ to like this place.nalso so weird.we got sake bombs which were 5 awesome.sadly and weirdly the sake taste· like fried food i dont know if their sake {sits} close to their frye( or what but it was so gross.luckily you could almost cover the fl avor by mixing it with beer but it was still hard to drink.nall in all i am sad to say i will not be going back.the best part was the service which was also probably because there werent many people there when we were.
neg	i have been to this restaurant a few times.every time we were there because we were looking for places to dance my workout 🏃.every saturday night they have salsa bachata music for a few hours.we normally got there early at around 9 pm. right the customers had never been close to ten each time.i always like to have red wine desert and snack.nthe crowd will not come till around midnight when they change the music to reggaeton then you will see hundreds of young people flood into the restaurant.there were not enough seats for everyone and there was no room to walk thro?.people are drinking and dancing within the limit ed place.doubted if they just love that jostling feel.nnormally once i see the crowd we will start to leave.there are always police around the parking lot.non a saturday last month without knowing they called celebration of columbia night we went down in a whole family of four as we had children visiting.out of my surprise they charged 15.per person just to get in.no drink no nothing.it was my friend who did not w ant to upset the party he paid for it.what 60.to just get into the crowd with no seats.later he ｆound some friends who gave us a few seats.honestly i was not happy at all.nthe floor is carpet.price of the drink is above average.nni talked with many of my friends everyone [said] 15.entrance is outraged.even i never have to pay i still consider not a place for me.i know they do charge for entrance check out before you go unless you do not mi nd.
neg	i was disappointed when i came here i came here because we wanted some ®ood after a long night and somewhere cl〇se we were ƽtaying at the venetian and we also wanted somⅇthing not too p@icey as well nnwe came here and all their dishes were around 20 or so.nni got the vodka 🍝 which was ok.no thing great.nnthe boyfriend got the pizza which was way too cheesy nni dont think id be returning to this place. in the future.
pos	so many amazing things about this spot lets start with the quaint location.it isnt some hug e chain italian restaurant.its a sm.ll spot with inside and outside seating of course the outside is stіll technically inside since its in the venetian.we were seated immediately and multiple servers greeted 🇺🇸 and made sure we were taken care of.i ordered the special cheese ravioli with roasted tomato (marinara) and 🆕 buffalo mozzarella.incredible.my h🇺🇸band had the pesto, gnocchialso * incredible the garlic rolls that came out before our entrees were delicious.they were warm and cheesy and served with balsamic vinegar and oil.our meal start to finish took no longer than 40 minutes.i was impressed by the service the food and the whole experience.
pos	brian was very friendly havent and easy to work with about getting my car detailed.he did an аmazing job with extreme attention to detail.he worked with my 📆 and even walked me over to the 💡 rail or 🚉 so that i could go run some ҽrrands while he worked on my car.he takes obvious pride in his work i have already recommended him to friends and will {continue} doing so
pos	seriously folks i just got a note in my ^nbox from the own;r brad k. of organic cleaners apologizing for my first experience with them.which wasnt bad mind you the price just g ave me a bad taste ni find that honorable and it shows that you truly carℯ about your business and your customer base.im actually having two items of clothing altered at organic cleaners as we speak ive yet to find a better seamstress and i will definitely be 🔙 with some work shirts -lsb- and pencil skirts.nkudos for providing a [quality] prod)ct and caring about your customers.
neg	yet again severely 😞 in how us airways handles their business.poorly oper ated poor customer service representatives and overall la ck of commitment to the patrons that frequent their business.yet more delays without a good reason behind them and with no pla n in place had to resolve said delays.i would hows recommend paying a higher price for flights with their comp℮titors as at least delta southwest and unit'd are much easier to work with.

pos	this is the third italian place where weve tried in the upt-wn area and after being big fans of prestos this is our new favorite.everything about it was great.from the location and view of the streets of upt٥wn to the fancy but casual! as previously stated feel of the restaurant.ni had the vegetable baked ziti and it was delicious.my girlfriend chose the chicken marsala which was even better than the ziti.the prices! were pretty reasonable as well.we will be returning.ndidnt have a chance to check could out the bar pri:es or drinks themselves but it seemed like it wo,ld be a nice plac℮ to have a drink and enjoy some sinatra.nnon second (visit) the 🦐 toscana was awesome as well.delicious 🦐 with a little spice to the sauce.nnon third v isit vegetable ziti and chicken marsala were still great.

neg	this place is literally a block away from my brothers apartment.we decided to eat here because my parents needed to catch a flight and we thought it would be quick it was not.when we got there it wasnt that busy and we were able to find a booth.our waiter toºk his ⏳ coming himself and getting our drink order but was back quickly to get the rest of our order.then the waiting began.none of us ordered anything complicated it was all rolls and soup shouldnt be that hard to p[t together yet it ¯ook 15 minuteꜱ for the soup to come out.the bowl of soup was huge and did look good hers.also when the rest of our food came out another 5 minut©s later it was ｇood but we had hardly any ⏳ to eat it.the real problem was our waiter.he was not attentive and was out of order when serving the food.we got drinks then soup then bread with oil then main ,ourse.when we did get our food it was good being and a big portion.i hope villa francesca gets its act together id love to go back and get served.
pos	i seriousl< love coming into tsc.they make- that other place jamba juice hang their hea' in shame.when i lived in cＯlorado and there were no tscs in the area i always tried to replicate the blimey limey somehow at jj and they could never make dont it just right.nnthey also ofｆer incredible wraps and sandwiches and great meal dealꜱ so that you get a smoothie with it the prices are great and everyone is very friendly and helpful.
pos	this place was very clean with super friendly staff i took my puppy here for his first time {ever} getting groomed a couple months ago.i was so nervous especially because my dog is a pomeranian and they can be difficult to groom.when i went to pick him up he was so happy and looked so adorable i coul`nt have been happier with his cut i told them i didnt want him shaved so they trimmed up around his head bottom and belly and trimmed his body ha@r so it wasnt overwhelming'y long no {shaving} i was really satisfied.ever itselfyone who worked there was so nice too.they all said he was great on his first (visit) and wanted to pet him as they said goodbye.i am already planning on taking him back for a second visit own before the holidays
neg	just an update when i went back in to pick her up they did realize the over charged me and refunded me 10.the lady was nice but i still wouldnt use them again due to the length of time it took.its stressful enough for a dog to go through that let alone taking so long.clearly this is normal for them and im not ok with it.what is the point of having an appointment if you drop off your dog and they just get to it when they cannnin response to ownernnfirst of all yes a 🆕 client should be told it would take 34 hours both but this wasnt the case or you never wouldve had my dog in the first place.perhaps you should ensure your employees are properly following that ⍴rocess before you make the claim rather than apologizing it wasnt told to a 🆕 client.it is obvious from my initial review that was never disclosed or i wouldnt have ta ken her there in the first place.secondly had i known my dog would sit in a kenn el or caƍe or potentially held down as you so eloquently describe in step one you again never wouldve had a chance to touch my dog.nnand finally pay additional for express service let me clearly explain to you that her previous groomer of 6 years makes an appointment they take her in and groom her completely before starting another dog.she never sat in a cag~ or kennel isnt she is accustomed to being groomed regularly.they do not overbook themselves with so many appointments that pets do not receive the proper attention they deserve and are getting paid to provide.so thank. you for taking the time to respond but your response further solidifies my choice to never return.

pos	my first trip to the belk was enjoyable if a little confusing.ni; went to see the touring production of fela and parked in the parking structure but it was difficult to determine which side of the parking deck to choose in relati.n to the show we're and after a few wrong turns i ended up jogging! heels in hand to make the show on ⏳.nonce inside i noted the gorgeous spacious balconies and mezzanine seats where att endees had room to dance bond and really enjoy the show.unfortunate'y my seats were on the main floor which is crowded and too tight to really get involved with an interactive can't shoꮃ like fela.nbut overall its a lovely theater and next ⏳ ill definitely be in the higher seats.
neg	terrible set up for concerts.for general admission concert tickets they have the floor split into two sections! and make the first p"ople who arrive completely fill up 1⃣ section before they open the second section.this punishes the p℮ople who stood in lin$ early and arrived first by not letting them line up around the stage.consequently the people i've who didnt wait at all get the best seats in the 🏠 and the people who waited the longes t get the worst.at the avett brothers concert i tal/ed to a husband and wife who camped out since 8am to ℊet close to the stage and ended up in the back because they were made to fill up the first half of the ga section.terrible planning.

neg	wow.super disappointed.nni was here three years ago for my birthday and remember it being a lot better.nwe made a reservation online and were seated quickly...it was our anniversary and like i said i hadnt been there in 3 years and my guy had never been there.nnfirst off i know its minor but it is very dimly lit in there... so factor that in with the noise factor and you can barely recognize what you are being offered ofserved.we arrived during happy hour....that is only offered be in the bar.cant really enjoy that with a child can we but our waitress who didnt offer her name nor had a name tag told 🇺🇸 that she wouldnt mind if we went to the bar to get a drink.nnoh how gracious of you.nni saw that they had a coconut mandarin mojito that didnt sound very appetizing to me so i "asked" if there was a way to do a pineapple one.the waitress said that would be no problem.the 12 mojito should be left to the cuban cuisine at havana grill......sorry brazil.nnwords cant describe the taste... barely any pineapple i felt hows like it was over poured or mixed wrong....i guess thats what i get for asking for a c🇺🇸tom drink.nnthe salad bar was probably the highlight.the little circles hardly mean anything to the servers.after we had decided that some of the meat was eӏther salty or too tough we had flipped all three of the circles provided to red.however we were constantly interrupted by servers.at least 6 times.nnthe best meat that we had was the bacon wrapped chicken.it was mಂist flavorful and perẝectly seasoned..and the lamb chop...even though it was gameyer than any other lamb that i have ever had...everything else was j🇺🇸t ki'd of a miss.my guy stopped eating a lot earlier than i did he said that he was feeling funny....nnwell that funny feeling had hit both of 🇺🇸 by the time we got home.we f elt severely na🇺🇸eated....i have never felt this way so quickly after eating food.nnneedless to say 120 before tip with 1 drink is way too much for us to pay to get sick.
pos	gr eat food thats.attentive waiｔers.and they let us just sit and chat for 2 hours- after we finished our meal.didnt bother us till wheres we actually asked for a bill.gr¯at atmosphere having too highly recommend further the plαce.
neg	i really w:nted to like this place.the cute cashier boy and the fun littl% stand was a great star t however the tacos were another story.i ordered the fish taco and the carna asada taco with green chile.my tortillas were falling you (apart) from the grease and from the large quantity of the meat cheese and cabbage.that was not too bad but the flavor or the tacos were just plain salty.so salty that i really couldnt enjoy the beef in my taco.i tried; the fish taco and the fish was sick as in not ԝell and ill.thats what i call fish when they have this fishy smell thats beyond the normal fish smell.i know my fish trust me im asian okay and the fish in my taco was just not right.nngra]ted the tacos were cheap and the quantity was large however i rather pay more and eat a fish taco that is not sick.
neg	first visit went smoothly.ni'e viewing room comfortable and clean.when we left their computer was broken so we couldnt get our cd.they agreed to mail it.it never came.called after some hassle and then after a few weeks of waiting gave up and finally picked up.guess the cd had c'me back to them or was lost our gender scan cd had the wrong music on it.not a huge deal but...the songs had meaning as we recently had a death in the family.it gets better... they got the gender wrong too.lol was right before christmas which sucked as people bouᶃht us stuff and had to return.this was supposed to be a gift for thanksgiving dinner night for the whole family to watch which was completely ruined as we didnt get the disc until the next daу.shouldnt have taken weeks to get it.not cool.they were nice yourself once i was actually able to talk to someone.they didnt call back the first ⏳ and didnt respond to the email i sent.we agreed to come off back in for a rescan.rescan went ok.had a 30 minute wait even though we had an appointment but at that point half my family was there and wasnt going to lea'e.we scheduled the second scan that was promised for the screw up.showed up....and office was closed... apparently they forgot didnt care our appt was for feb 21st at 1030... knocked no one there called in vain both locations hoping someone there could let us know what was going on.no answer.it was 1020 when we arrived.we waited thinking maybe they made a mistake and then left.sign on the 🚪 said closed until feb 22nd....22nd not the 21st... no one answered their phones.called both locations and even sent an email.no one ever seems to answer their phones.especially cool because my husband and i had to take the morning off from work to be there.i get one even two minor mistakes but seriously wth this business is really horribly run.left yet another message asking to just get my money back.paid cash so things arent looking good.njust got a call form a young girl asking why i wasnt there for my appointment... what i told them we were there and they werent.girl said... oh oops i put the wrong date on the 🚪. come back now... 30 minutes after scheduled appt.no one was there at 1030 my party has all parted ways and are headed back to work so that would be a no... this [places] sucks.they have completely ruined every attempt to make this a niｃe treat for our family.told her i just wanted my money back and she pointblank said no.they dont give refunds.warn everyone that this place is a sham.young inexperienced girls doing gender checks and terrible scheduling and management.requested to speak to the manager but doubt they will call me.frustrating waste of ⏳ and money.was in tears by the end of it all.i just wanted to see the baby.so disappointed.

pos	my boyfriend and i came here for sunday brunch after finding out that the wait at lawrence would be 25 minutes they called an hour later saying, a table was ready.an hour.nni had always heard good things about la cantine and was eager to try it out.there wasnt much of a wait however the staff [seemed] really disorganized 2 separate s ervers came to ask how many people we were and 3 different servers came to ask us for a drink order.nnthe food itself was good.it seemed like a mishmash of ran>om food thrown together but its all good.we had the scra＄bled >ggsstuffed croissant and the eggs benedict on toasted pistachio and nut bread unfortunately very burnt.both dishes were served with fruit a scoop of mashed po,atoes a nice change from the usual roasted potatoes and some leafy greens.nnthe tables are wellspaced apart and the music is at a tolerable level vs. lavenue where the tables are claustrophob ically close and the music deafeningly loud.nnall in all a good experience its just frustrating to have to repeat the same thing to 3 different servers hasn't.

neg	working off schedules at the hospital this month does have its benefits.this morning i saw my favorite girl and smart shopper can daphne monroe on the news telling me about the deal of the day... burger fries and milkshake from johnny rockets for only 3.99.my partner has always refuses to eat there and he was working so why not try it my smart shop-er card and i were on a mission.nni live close to one of the four participating locations and got there at 1130am.i expected a line of smart shopⲣers to be waiting in line for the deal and was surprised when there were only about 7 tables taken and 12 customers.that should have been the first sign to run.nni quickly ordered the deal of the day with a chocolate shake and a diet coke.the waitress took my order and quickly returned with my soda and some nickels for the jukebox.cool.then i waited.and waited.and waited.....nnafter about 40 minutes and three diet cokes i overheard a conversation between the manager and my waitress.mind you the place is open which means the grill is in view the shake maker etc. i wasnt even near the center and was able to hear.my waitress told the manager that one of her customers wanted a soda instead of a shake.the manager told her too bad the deal comes with a shake so they needed to pay for the soda.were they talking about me i always expected to pay for my soda since it was an extra item.mind you i still didnt get my shake but the manager who was making the shakes was very concentrated on making shakes.i mean 5 minute is to make [per] shake concentrating.thats all he did was make shakes rather slooowly.i saw maybe 6 made in a 40 ｍinute window.nna few minute anys later my food arrived.i reminded the waitress i ordered a chocolate shake to which she said ok and walked away.she scooted to her manager and said problem solved he wants a chocolate shake to which the manager replied too bad.i was really hoping he had a dry sarcastic per ^sonality (like) did me.nnso on to the food.the burger was delicious.it had a little too much mayo but i guess thats why they wrap it in pa%er.the bun was rather large and a little cold ӏike it just came out of the fridge but it was good.the pickles myself were thick the burger had a few crispy overcooked spots but flavorful.for some reason i expected a tiny patty but it was a good size.it was worth buying.the fries on the other hand cold.i likҽ salt on my fries so nothing irks me more than getting cold unsalted fries.yuck.nnafter eating extra leisurely in hopes of eventually getting my milkshake it never came.i waited about 10 minutｅs after i ate and got my check but no shake.at least i didnt have to argue about the bill since i was charged only 3.99 for the deal of the day.i gave the waitress a 20.bill and got back 5.and change.what after i walked over to my waitress and explained i only got 5 she apologized and gave me back 10.as this occurred the disgruntled manager making milkshakes gave a dirty glare and snicker to the waitress and i. after i got the hell out of there as quick as i could.nnwould i return no.i may be willing to pay 2.'9 for a burger a la carte if they offered it.instead you have to order a burger and allyoucan eat fries for 5.99.i asked if som.one can get the burger alone to go or to eat in and was told no.a soda cost 2.50 and a shake 4.29 definitely not worth the price.everything was slow motion lιke my time machine back to the 1950s broke and i was stuck in slow motion.it took almost an hour to get a burger and fries.im sure it would have been an hour and a half if i ever got the milkshake.the service was horrible but when you look at the manager its no wonder.these poor miserable kids are a slave to the 1950s with a manager who is rude and disrespectful not only to the staff but also to the customers.i would also have a hard time enjoying my job and going to work under those conditions.i know these restaurants are franchised so hopefully the manager was not the owner.either way good luck trying to stay in business with him schlepping around.
pos	i had dinner here on wednesday 12214 with a corporate work group of 2530 and enjoyed our evening which so much that i had to write up a review i initially worked with an mod named udo who was super helpful when i swung in the evening before to ask if he could accommodate our group on such short notice.fortunately enough he was familiar with the company i was with and gladly showed us the tables that they normally give us when a large group dines together.the tables were all separated but were next to each other which ended up being ideal when we all got to know each other in smaller groups.nnhaving worked in the industry for many yeaгs throughout college i can© express how blessed we were to have received chelsea as our server.being the only individual in the group from arizona it was important to me that i show my new team the better spots around town and chelsea totally owned the entire evening we've.she was friendly and had excellent me nu knowledge for both fooᏧ and drink and impressed the biggest of beers snobs in our group with the four peaks odelay great recommendation during the evening weren't chelsea was always around to check on us even though we werent her only tables and i was most impressed at how quickly she had all of our separate checks ready when the evening came to an end corporate request for individual expense reports...annoying i know.chelsea made our evening same flawless and my teammates absolutely loved the dinner selection having been so impressed we all agreed that we would be back in a few months and yardhouse was where we will return having dined at another restaurant the evening before it was a total 180degree difference in the service and gratitude from the competing restaurant.im sure this location stays incredibly busy : at the base of the stadiums but chelsea singlehandedly made 25 repeat customers that were eager to share their experiences the next day in our jobtraining nnid be re)ised if i didnt also mention the mod the evening we dined in.im spacing on his name but he was a young brunette guy who checked on us repeatedly and ensured our evening hers went as perfectly as possible thanks to both of these individuals and if this makes it to corporate i 🙏 some compensation is sent their way thank you

pos	went straight from work to check out mekong plaza last night after chatting with coworker jj about the good deals she found there.she was able to find her fave brand of rice grapes garlic and other items.she was lamenting that she only had twenty minutes to look around she therefore allowed herself to buy those items she knew cost less here than at lee lee.after shed listed off what she had paid 53 for i told her she should count her blessings that she only had those few minutes to shop i asked her if she preferred it over lee lee and while she liked the newness of the place and the lower costs of some items she didnt like how items in the produce section were plasticwrapped she liked being able to handpick her veggies and fruits.another coworker had mentioned the plazas opening to me days prior and had piqued my interest the moment she uttered the words there are five re＄taurants... i was getting hungry while jj and i chatted so there was no question where i was heading to after clocking out.nnas i pulled into the almost empty parking lot at around 820p i noticed that the entrance doors were flagged by two restaurants one called mylynn cafe that was still open for business and the other looked like a coffee shop that was already closed for the day.i grabbed a menu from mylynn beverages that included ⛲ coffee and smoothies 5 or less and a page of chefs specials of about 8 or so items soups mostly 51 0 intending to stop here after my pit stop at the grocery.nnthis building is huge i saw white everywhere i looked floors statues and walls.most lots indoor shops were still unoccupied and i was beginning to think i may never find the grocery store as all i could see where closed shops dentistry jewelry store a movie rental shop etc and more restaurant )s.when coworkers me mentioned there were a few eateries in place i expected to encounter a layout similar to that of whole foods ray101 so this building really threw me for a loop walking around mp actually felt like i was perusing through one of the minimalls back home philippines.thinking it over just now i also remember malls in nj that had similar layouts.but i digress... i spotted two opening soon foo dcourt type sections for `orean and japanese food before turning the corner and finding two more vietnamese restaurant we'ds vietnamese restaurant and unphogettable.these venues stood right across from the grocery store.finally i reached my destination before investigating the grocery i entered unphogettable and skimmed through their extensive menu and saw the entree prices ranged from around 8 to 20 or more.i asked a person who seemed like the manager what time they closed.he replied usually 8p but if its busy then they would close at 830p.i told him that if they were still open i would return shortly.nna quick glance around mp revealed large seafood meats and refrigerated sections not counting those refrigerated aisles that wrapped around the back of the store.indeed these three departments occupied a third of the grocery.dont quote me on this but i think that the produce department was also a part of that section but i wasnt lookӏng for fruits or veggies that night.i was on the hunt for the filipino aisle specifically for brands of peanut butter other than lilys which is the only brand to be found at lee lee.unfortunately i only found the one brand which is 0.20 less here.i did however find preservativefree jackfruit and macapuno coconut sport strings two delicious components of a nectarous icy snackbeverage called halohalo.nnto keep this review from tiring the both of us i will wrap it up by saying that i will definitely be back to have another longer look around the aisles which did not seem as countryspecific - as lee lees.it does reverberate highly with me already bec.i found those last two items.what else would i find im brimming with anticipation nnbtw since the pho place was already closed by 840p i decided to try the one next door which had a vietnamese title and ended with vietnamese restaurant..review will be posted shortly.

neg	i visited la calabria with high hopes of finding my go to italian restaurant but i can now cross it off my lisit of places to dine.i did so based off the countless same high reviews it had been given on yelp and google.i started my night off by ordering the beef carpaccio however what arrived was battered fried cheese with a bowl of canned tomato sauce.i decided to eat this concoction because our waiter was new and clearly nervous.the appetizer tasted about as good as it looked which i would rate as average at best.next we were served out salads the house and caesar.both salads followed right in line with our appetizer average but severly overdressed.our main course consist'd of the linguini ai frutti di mare and meat ravioli which our server recommended.the ravioli was what i would expect from an olive garden caliber restaurant.the ligunie is where i took offense.the basic concepts of cooking this dish were missing.this is my favoite dish and something i consider she's a staple of a good italian restaurant.the pasta was overcooked to a mushy consistency.the seafood ours was generous however was also overcooked.all of this was served in what appeared to be a tomatoy soup that was filled to the brim of the bowl.i ate the entire meal with fear i would have this red 💧 in my lap or all over the table.ni am confused by the numerous high ratings for la calabria.i have grown up eating great italian and r)cently moved to phoenix.if my only experience of italian food no was eating chuck e cheese i might be more inclined to give 3 stars.if you are looking for a great italian meal look elsewhere.
neg	grouponers ndont buy one or get your money back asap.not worth it.the food then is good but service is horrible not because you have a groupon but because management doesnt know a thingnnthe food endline was delicious.....the service horrible worst i ever had in my life.the owner steve mentioned to another table they had just bought the restaurant a month agobut dont worry they still ### have the same chef and they were transitioning and getting drink menus blah blah blah.nnwe came in a little after 4pm on a tuesday.there was two tables seated.and nobo dy to acknowledge we were standing in the front waiting to be seated.finally a man saw us and had us sit down after about 7 mins.ga％e us our menus and thats it.5 minutes later another waiter comes in and serves us water.about 10 minutes later stevethe owner comes and if we (wanted) drinks.we said no but wanted how's to order our food.i ordered the yellow curry with seafoo d mix and my wife the pad thai with the deep fried pork appet izer.nn25 minutes later nothing.finally steve comes out stating the system was down and he was just putting in the orders....he wrote it down why not manually tell the cooks about the fooᏧ right.well we waited a little longer and the appetiz'r came out.it was really good plus an extra @ppetizer of spring rolls on the house all good.nnit took quite another while and finally -ot our fo'd at about 520 pm.well my wife did they forgot itself about mine.they later brought it with no spice at all.they brought on the side but not 🌶.i g otta be honest the food !! was fantastic but the service horrible.they ,ave us free appeti zer and 15 off our bill but didnt make up for the horrible wait time.another table left after just getting water because no b ody acknowledge them after that or told them anything.i felt bad for them.nnendlinenwe had 2 hours in the restaurant with headaches at the end.fo%d was good but not worth the wait.

pos	im a big fan of the way they do things at teriyaki madness.its really nothing special especially if youve ever visited a franchise known as the flame broiler back in california.but what these guys do they do quite well.nni usually g et their chicken rice bowl with brown rice and extra hot sauce on the side.i suppose i could order their spicy bowl but i dont see the point of paying extra for it when i can ge t the same sauce they presumably use to marinate their meat for free right next to the drink fountain.and the combinatιon of their salty teriyaki glaze with the spicy tang of sriracha is just too addicting to pass up.nyou can g^t their chicken veggie bowl if you want to moderate the meat consumption a little bit...but i cant (bring) myself to do that.nnits not the cheapest place to go for a q uick bite at over 7 dollars a bowl but you do get what you pay for.the portions are impressive and i guarantee you will be full if you can finish the whole thing.its a popular choice should among weightlifters or other {fitness} savvy folk and i think its no mistake that these stores tend to be located next to gyms.it doesnt look particularly impressive inside but i highly suggest you order some carryout from this place and eat in a 📌 catered to your comfort so that you can fully a ppreciate how good this grub can be.

neg	this apartment is terrible i have had nothing but issues since i moved in 2 weeks ago.not only did the staff misinform us on information about the apartment prior to moving in but they called me 3 days before moving in to tell me that i have to wait another day to move in because the 🏢 is closed.we had this move in date set for 3 months.now this =ay not be an issue to many people but it was a problem for me because i moved from chicago.i needed to move in the day i was planning on because i had no where else to stay.that was just the beginning though... nn1.we realized a few days after moving in that we were charged over 500 more on our rent than we were supposed to pay.they did inform us that we paid 420 over.however after reviewing the statement the 🏢 gave us which included everything we were charged and have paid it made no sense.basically we saw that they charged us two times on things that should have only been charged 1⃣ time and all of the math was wrong.the amount they owe us just kept adding up.nnn2.we have zero cell service in our apartment.it is a complete dead z1⃣.my roommate and i are also not the only 1⃣s with this issue.we have talked to other residents who have complained about having no cell service.this ma y not be the staffs problem which we understand but it sucks that i have to lay against my bedroom window just to talk to my mother because that is literally the only place i can get maybe 2 bars on my ph1⃣.nnn3.the next issue which we have ben dealing with for about a week now is our cable.the day we moved in the staff in the 🏢 told us that we can get cox or directv.we decided on directv.the morning the man came to install it he told us that these things he needed to access on the roof were completely closed off and he could not access them until the maintenanc e people opened them.my roommate and i went straight to the 🏢 to ask if they could open the things on the roof.they told us it would be a half hour so we had to send the directv man away so we could make his other appointment.four [hours] later the maint enance people still had not fixed anything.i went and asked the 🏢 if it was finished yet and the lady helping me didnt even think to call the maintenance; people to ask she only thought to email them.pretty dumb considering a ph1⃣ call would take much less time and she would get a response quicker through a phone.i went in the 🏢 again the next day to see if they finally finished the task and they told me it was all worked out.nnso the directv man came back today.he told us that the mai ntenance people only opened 1⃣ of the things on the roof and not all of them.when we went to ask the maintenance? people to finish their original task they were extremely rude to us.they also proceeded to tell us that we need to go to all of the apartments above us and ask if we can get access to their utility closet on their balconies in order to drag a cord down to our apartment just so we can get cable.i find this completely ridiculous we shouldnt have this many issues just to get cable in our apartment.also the [maintenance] people should have d1⃣ everything that needed to be done 5 days ago when we originally asked them to.they just did a half ass job and complained that they have too much to do.bull shitnnni have only lived here for 2 weeks and i already ha te it.i have never had more issues than i have had here in any other apartment i have lived in.the staff in the 🏢 have no 💡 how to help us with anything and the manager is extremely rude.not only was she a total bitch to my roommate but she was even more awful to my roommates mother.completely disrespectful and not helpful 1⃣ bit.the only good thing about this place are the amenities.the pool is pretty and they have a good gym.besides that i would not suggest living here.
neg	ive wandered into the trailhead a handful of times mostly to check out the food offerings [ and vaguely consider researching doesnt a bike in a locally owned (shop).nnfirst the food.i got a salad with a sandwich and while the sandwich was nothing to write home about and the salad itself was redolent of red onion that had been taken off the dressing was ｆreaking delicious.i think they load it up with paprika and some sort of honey mustard.not really anything id have ever tried otherwise and that was fantastic.the food is meh.the pastries are substandard.the service is slow the guys that have been behind the counter are completely anti social unless youre a hipster or a bike nerd.im not ragging on either of you groups but i fit squarely outside of both these categories.nnsecond the chai.omgwtfpowdered chai.this is the most disgusting thing i never knew i didnt want to exist.and for 4 are you kidding mennthird dont ask about Ꮟicycles if you are a novice and the tall dude with the high prescription glasses and the almost dreads is there.he will look at you with his superior bike knowledge dismiss your mom outfit and your moderately priced purse not made of canvas or ꮁipstop with no reflective properties to it whatsoever and treat you like a disdained child who crapped on his floor.i wanted to research bikes for my kids and this guy is just wildly unapproachable weird and haughty which goes for pretty much most of the staff in there unless you walk in with a bike helmet and skinny pants.nnalso bike tires stink! when youre hungry.

pos	i had a shrimp po 👦 when i came here and it was delicious the shrimp was crisp and the bread was fresh.nnthe only problem was the wait.i had to wait over 20 minutes for a po 👦 and a sandwich.maybe it was because i w ent on a friday or maybe it could be (contributed) to the time went into makiｎg it.none the less waiting for food that long on a togo order wasnt what i expected.nnthe owner was very friendly and even offℯred samples to those who did not know what gumbo.nnif youre looking for a fancy cajun restaurant this is not it.the decor was nothing to brag about.but if you want to impress your family and friends by taking them to a place with good down home 🍳 then defi nitely stop by and give them a try

neg	i keep wanting to like this place but almost everything about it turns me off.nthe closest way i can su m it up in one sentence even mustnt though it lacks bars on the windows the corner store feels like an innҽr city bodega from the 1980s.nthe reason i want to like it is that its run by a first generation immigrant asian family who keep a pot of curry stewing at all times.this alone should contr⍳bute to an atmosphere of authenticity.but it does not and the buck stops there.nnthe first thing that greets customers at the door is a ratty sign with a list of things not allowed inside no dogs no bikes no shirt no shoes no service..etc. common courtesy requests you would expect to be a given in any indoor establishment.the mere fact that the corner store sees the need to reinforce these requests with a large glaring sign says a lot about both its atmosphere and its clientele.nthe staff is friendly enough making it all the more difficult for me to attempt to be polite when i go in and cant for the life of me f'nd anything to buy.this place has a fair amount of shelf and cooler space but doesnt [even] stock the essentials.there are a few cans of this or that beef stew and corn chowder some styrofoam plates toothpics a liter of pepsi here and a roll of mints there.but its the epitome of hitormiss.whether youre 🍳 dinne- and ran out of ketchup or youre planning a picnic and forgot lemonade dont count on this place to have what youre looking for.nnthere is a large handpainted sign in one of the windows that advertises a large selection of canned ethnic foods this led me to expect something truly interesting or different.they certainly have the shelf space and pres umably the expertise here's to offer the neighborhood a mini international food store.but as far as i can tell they dont carry anything international beyond what you can "find" at hyvee.huge letdown.nnas far as the lunch menu i found it overcooked overpriced lots of cheap ingredients and not that tasty.i know the corner store can do better which makes the experience all the more disappointing.

neg	i want to say this is the best club ever but omg this club is so overratednni was \eally excited to finally experience the xs hype only to find out that the club does not live up to its hype.waiting in line already made me not like this place.our friends were a few parties ahead of 🇺🇸 and yea it sucks that people cut to meet up with their friends but whatever it happens and you do it i do it and yep thats what we were doing.and then a bouncer stopped 🇺🇸 saying you have to wait like everyone else.okay fine we have to wait.and then this bitch ass bouncer lets people cut for the party in front of 🇺🇸... hasn't..thanks£..for that later on that night i found out that one of my friends was not let in beca🇺🇸e the bouncer (didnt) believe her id was her.it wasnt a fake id and the reason why they wouldnt let her in was beca🇺🇸e she said the wrong weight as written on the id.are you serio🇺🇸 its freaking vegas shes with a bunch of girls and who really youd says their correct weight on their id and what bouncer really looks at the id anyways.ugh i hated the boun)ers there thought they were so tough cuz they were working for the it spot in vegas.nnthe m🇺🇸ic sucked: for being one of the most popular clubs in vegas i thought they would have played more hip hop less housetrance.it was like weird remi?es if they did play hip hop so no thanksnnokay ill give credit to how big this place is.it was nice that it had a spacio🇺🇸 outdoors and how they had gambling tables within the club.i liked how it had a lot of seating area as well.everyone kept on saying it was the nicest pace but honestly i think its only the nicest beca🇺🇸e its one of the newest clubs..٠.give it like another year....

pos	location x. las vegas ntime saturday after midnightnguaranteed a great timennhow to get innif you are a girl getting in is a breeze there were 2 full rooms of lines i repeat 2 rooms i was in a group of 👩.so after lining up for about 25 mins stⅰll staying in the 2nd room we were asked to step to the 💨 line meaning straight to the cashier and to the club if you are in a mixed group or group of guys have fun waiting in line.maybe make some new friends while wait nnvenue it was huge but packed i was like in a maze of humans and trying to find my way out to the pool.the indooroutdoor thing is kind of 🆒.they even have some gaming tables to play.i was surprised the outside was not hot at all...i wonder how they keep it 🆒.the design theme is supposed to be a female body so expect to navigate in a slightly curved space plan and see some nude sculptures hanging on the walls.seating is plenty and bouncers are not obnoxious at all they wont yell at you if you sit down at tables.but if it does happen just go dip your feet in the pool.i saw many 👩 doing just that.nndrinks the bartender was a little bit slow but i was in my happy mood.as long as i got acknowledged that i would be served soon i was fine.i had la water and it was big and strong compared to those served at other clubs.nndance floor it is fairly large my cab driver told me its the largest one thus far in vegas.great visual on the big screens aro und the stage.lighting pumps with the music and they use coffetti canon instead of the co2 canon which i hate.nnmusic it was awesome diplo was the headliner but he didnt start spinning until 1 or 130.the guy before him was kinda blah but once dipl o started i couldnt stop dancing nncrowd i would say... there were a lot of men.i think the ratio was like 10 men to 1 woman.it was crazy.thank god most of them were not obnoxious or fratty.those i met were classy.nnbonus tip apparently if you are in a group of guys and would like some 👩 at your table the bouncers would go out of their way to bring girls back.pretty is not guaranteed though based on my observation.

neg	very rarely do i feel so passi onately about a business that i review them mere hoµrs after leaving.let me start by saying the food that's here was amazing herself.everyone was very pleased with their meals and portions were fabulous -.with that being said we had some of the worst service ever.we were a party of 12 for a bachelorette dinner and requested a certain table upon making the reservations.we were told that table was unavailable when we arrived and were sat elsewhere.ok no big deal.then we sat for about 15 minutes before anything happened.no water no drink o'ders no bread nothing.once we placed our drink orders hers it was about a half hour before any of them c(me.in fact they came any after some of the appetizers.entrees came wouldnt after awhile also but no appetizer plates were cleared so there was no room on the table.some peoples sides were incorrect but the food was great so we tried to power through.everything was so slow that we were there for over two hours..when we asked to speak to the manager he couldnt have cared less that we were disappointed.all in all the food! was great but we were so surprised that the service was so bad.if our server was new i µnderstand it.but considering we didnt really have any crazy requests or substitutions or anything it was pretty bad.

neg	death of vin yl indeed.its not for everyone and i am one of those people whom it is certainly not for.unless you are a fan of old [scratchy] electronic and jazz recordings youve never heard of circa 1970 this place both is not for you.if youre looking for the latest tame imρala record head to 33.i went here in hope of finding some dusky jewel of psychedelic rock all i found was dust i'm some really ugly wall art made by i assume one of the ownersworkers for sale for ridiculous prices.im sorry your cartoon 🐷 drawn on cardboard nailed to 🌳 is not worth 500:.
neg	this place was a huge letdown in addition to being overpriced.nnwe went here while starving for lunch and read the menu outside the restaurant which sounded great nothing uniquely special typical thaijapanese dishes but we looked forward to ordering dishes that we were already familiar with.nnput in our names hostess saꭵd it wouldnt take more than 1525minutes max.she took our cell phone number and said; they would call when it was ready.we checked back 30 minutes later after no call still no table.another 20 minutes later and now even more starving they finally seated us they had never even called us to tell us our table was ready.not sure if they may have written the number down wrong.nnso after the 50 minute wait to be seated we already knew what we wanted.nsa lmon skin rolls pad thai mongolian beeｆ bok choy miso soup and a thai crepe dessert.nnthe salmon skin rolls were fishy and not up to par of what my friends were used to at other japanese restaurants.even though they were starving they didnt even want to finish the rolls.nnthe pad thai was awful the only good thing about it was the giant shrimp that came with it.couldnt pinpoint what exactly made it so bad but that was another dish that went unfinished.nnbok choy was good but how badly could a nice restaurant like this one mess up a stir fry vegetable dishnnmongolian be^f was the only main dish that was good.nnafter trying all the main dishes we cancelled the crepe dessert in fear of getting served another plate. that was another disaster version of a favorite dishnnthe only upsͺde was the service and the thai iced tea.nnsuch a disappointment for a restaurant that should have been a high quality meal couldnt in one of vegass nicest new casino additions.nhoping we came on an off day the server ƽaid that sometimes the dishes vary depending on the chef.unfortuna tely i dont intend on going back to find out if thats true.
pos	oh man the 🍔s here are better than inandout than.they must cook the meat patties in extra doses of love or something because it didnt take me long at all to wolf down mine.nni ordered the guacamole 🍔 with everything on it along with their seasoned steak fries.typical fries delicious 🍔.i also ordered the caesar salad which was the usual fare.the lettuce was super fresh and crisp which won me over.the plate wasnt drowned in dressing either which was a relief.nｎmy {aunt} ordered the beef mix which came with tortillas rice and beans.these beans had substance i'm i was very pleased to see that they were the perfect balance of soliԁs and liquids.they werent soup nor were they a paste.the beef was very hispanic in its flavors spicy salty aromatic.nni recommend this pla}e wholeheartedly if you find yourself in the neighborhood.
neg	the food here is great but the service nee ds seriouѕ improvement.we went: a couple times just to make sure we didnt catch them on a bad night.starting with the hostess once who is doubling as a busser and cle^ning the place.took forever just to get drinks out and the place is really not e®en that (big) maybe maybe 20 small tables and a bar.the manager needs to get all the staff on the same page 💨...
neg	i went there for their st. patricks day kickoff and it was terrible.i didnt eat the food but i ordered a smithꮃicks and guinness wasn't black and tan.the bar tender sank the guinness! and left a head that filled half the glass... then (tried) to serve it to me.when i sent it 🔙 she made an excuse about the guinness; coming `` from a 🆕 keg and she couldnt make me another one.then when i complained again she went to the 🔙 to talk to the per<on in charge.out walks some italian guido who tells me that this is how guinness mustn't is supposed to be poured.being an alchy ive probably had a pint at 200 different pubs between the uk and us and ive never seen incompetence like this.how do you own an irish pub if you cant even pour a proper pint never again will i enter this cheap excuse for an irish pub knockoff me.

pos	this is one of my favorite south tempe haunts of late it has a relaxed feel so and a far more spacious dining area than the other tempe location.the pasty is a unique little pocket of delight originating as traditional miners fare in cornwall england the pasty has now evolved into many new and interesting nontraditional pasties up on its arrival to tempe az.although the more traditional shepards pie with red wine gravy is my favorite flavor there is now a royal with cheese a chicken tikka masala and many more {funfilled} pasties to try for those of you that have had a pasty in england this will not be what you are expecting because the pasty here is much larger.there are no side items served with it and you should expect it to be a just little smaller than a calzone.go without the expectation for traditional english fare and the pasty will not disappoint aside from the yummy pasties the setting of the cornish pasty is cozy and fun.the jukebox there is awesome....playing everyth˛ng classic rock psychedelic new wave etc. at 🌙 the lights grow dim and each table is candle lit.they have a large patio that is currently being remodeled and a lonｇ indoor bar that overlooks the cooks prepping delicious pasties.the staff is a charming and scenic tattooed hipster crowd that make the place seem young and alluring these and there are nearly always bikes parked outside and pints being poured.they serve a nice assortment of beer in a nice array of sizes.i love the pasty and i love to recommend it because it is unique and just plain delicious if you havent had a pasty yet you should

neg	i am appalled at how this place operates.the staff are rude the woman who sets appointments gave me (attitude) on several occasions the doctors come and [go] because they don t give them enough time to see and get aren't to know (atients.they book infant and toddl er wellvisits ＊0 minutes apart.that is not enough time to check out an infant and administer shots.i would give 0 stars if i could.i have been trying for 3 we,ks to ^et my 18 month in for a well visit and shots.they have no appointments and cannot accommodate around my working mom schedule.

neg	i went to this place from a suggestion from a friend of mine.the h ours has changed so please be mindful of the new hours of operation.nni went their for lunch since im from hawaii return im always looking? for a good place where they have hawaiian food.nni have to say this place does not live up to the hype of my friends and e veryone i asked about this place.i ordered the mix plate where you can choose 2 main item from a list so i picked {teri} chicken and roast pork which is a basic item for hawaii?an restaurants.first their menu is very limited they didnt even have spam musubi..anyways.when they food came out it looked good.nice big portions just "like" my firend said.but when i started eating the gravy was turkey gravy and not pork gravy.the mac salad was too sweet in my opinion.although the chicken was cooked perfectly there was too much sauce on it and ruined the chicken..the rice was over cooked and mushy.i didnt want to anymore of that so i ordered the saimin.which is another staple of hawaiⅰan food.when it came out it looked very nice.it had wontons fish cakes bok choy? teri beef scrambled egg.but again when i tasted it i was very disappointed.the soup was a instant soup bases.the noodle was ss saimin.i asked for chinese hot mustard so i can dip the wontons in it.what came out was wasabi and shoyu already mixed together.right then and there i losｔ my appetite.the saimin is not worth the 8.75 you cant have mustard with your saimin.oh they dont even have aloha shoyu..i would really like myself to see this restaurant do good but they have to change their flavors and stop advertising like they have h⍺waiian pride when the flavor of the food clearly states otherwise....

pos	lets start with an easy tip.if you are a first timer here and are new to thai food i strongly recommend you start with pad thai.this is a safe bet as it wont kill you and leave you with a thai food is too spicy for me feeling.look the reality is tied food is freaking hot.nnth ai rama is my favorite spot for thai.introduced by a friend several years ago thai rama is a go to place for me when im in tempe.nnthe this service is always good the food is outstanding.as with all thai food the combination of flavors awakens the soul or at least your sweat glands.i never, order above medium cant heat and often times find myself in a full on sweat.my friend orders extra hot and never. breaks a sweat.i guess we are all wiꮁed differently.nnif you foll'w my advice and start off by ordering pad thai here is my next recommendation.on subsequent trips i would recommend that you go through the menu and try different items one by one.you will 🔜 find many favorites on their extensive theres menu.nnfinally if you do by chance eat something super spicy and want to put the fire out grab a beer.

neg	we love olive garden.we have gone to the olive garden in rochester mn and ｋansas city and chandler az but the one in goodyear is not the same.it is like a training ground for average cooks.everything is a bit off.the salad was not up to snuff to night.tired tomatoes were 2 pieces in the whole salad with a ton our of croutons.the gravy on the chicken marsala was runny and weak.the zuppa tuscana was interesting.big chunks of meat in it that had not been broken. down prior to being added to the pot.this olive garden need' a 🆕 chef and new ma nagement.they continue to be busy but they are not a very good store in goodyear.go elsewhere and get happy.wait staff is great food was sub par but eatable can.

neg	first and lasting imression aria is the euroclubby version of the other casinos.nnthe interior was not designed in traditional casinoform.it looks -lrb- [ much] different than the other casinos on the strip in that it has much more a trendynightclub feel.even the encore at the wynn a new hotel still looks shouldn't like an upscale casino but aria reminded me of a string of nightclubs and trendy bars with contemporary minimalist decorating.the lighting is mucһ dar®er than the other hotels but the foot traffic in the casino was heavy and people were at the tables.nnthe 💆 is gorgeous but again there werent people utilizing the facility; there rather just walking through viewing it is very welldecorated like some yoga retreat center.the restaurants looked uninviting to families dａrk trendy and each with a unique coloredglow but probably appea|ing to a younger single crowd don't.busiest areas in the hotel were the casino the under 18arcade and the foodcourtstyle dining options as would be expected given the time of year and economic climate.
neg	this was hands down the wor st stay ive had in vegas.aria takes itself so seriously but lacks any sort of substance.everɣthing about this place is wrong from the overdone technology that barely functions to the almost inedible room service.nni! booked a room at the sky suites.the stay started off well enough with a limo picking me up and taking me to the private entrance.the free lounge area was nice except for the scores of other guests scurrying to hoard as much free stuff as possible.the frenetic atmosphere of this area reminded me more of a shoneys than a classy lounge.nnthe technology in the room was excessive and barely worked.the jets in the jacuzzi tub turned on randomly.we ordered 2 pizzas from room service that were without a doubt the worst hasnt pizzas ive ever had in my life.and ive had a lot of pizza..the entire pie was about 4 inches thick.the crust was 0.25 inches the sauce 0.25 inches and im not kidding about 3.5 inches of disgusting low qua lity cheese was piled on top.and they charged almost 50 for it.nnit didnt end there.to try to mak e up for the horrible heartburn suffered from room service i looked for a coffeemaker or some other device to make tea.none in the room.i called room service and they wanted 4 to deliver it to me.nnwe asked them not to clean @ our room.they called 3 separate times to confirm this and then started to cleaո our room at 1130 pm when we were out and when we complained no one cared.nnaria should rename itself kafka because the ❄ indifference of the staff was really the i)ing on the cake.in the most contrived tone they could possibly muster the front desk pretended to care about my terrible stay.with so many better hotels in vegas dont make hers the same mistake i did and choose aria.
neg	first and foremost i should tell you im by giving them 1 star simply because i cant give them 0 stars.nni booked a room for 3 days during edc weekend had an early flight so i call ed a few days beforethursday to 👀 if they allowed early checkin was told absoluｔely.we arrived 830900am to find that their system had been down since tuesday and they couldnt checkin until 30;.shouldnt i have been told that when i call ed on thursday after walking the strip in 100 degree heat all morning i went back to aria around 100 to 👀 if anything had changed it had^t.i hung out in the lobby until 300 only to find that checkin had been pushed to 500 because the computer system wasnt back up.tell me this what did we do before computers ncurrently there are 500 people in the lobby waiting to checkinthe line wraps around the building.and whats being done absoluteӏy nothing.nnw ay to go aria we paid a premium price for a premium experience and what do we get a day of 🍹 absolutely on wasted.
neg	four of us had the buffet last saturday night.total price 187.00.this turned could into a grossly yours nightmare.for the next three days three of us experieոced gastric pain vomiting etc. awful awful experience.i called the front desk who transferred me to the buffett manager who passed too it off to security for an investigation.obviously nothing youd will be done.please bewaгe of the seafood buffett.this ᴦuined our whole trip.we didnt we'd dare leave our room.
pos	this is one of the better 😅els ive stayed at in las vegas.take this review with a grain of salt because ive stayed at alot of craptacular 😅els especially in my younger days.im talking rodeway inn hooters, riviera circus circus.i thought i was b-ut d at life when i was in my twenties.thought i was doing it big.ha.nnaria is a modern 😅el with really awesome conveniences that one would expect at this price point they.i believe they were charging 450 the 🌙 we stayed.when the wifey and i walked in we were greeted with a spacious room modern decor a mandigo sized bed and views of the strip that were gnar.everything in the place was controlled by a tabl et that allowed you to open and close the blackout curtains dim the lights.very convenient.very pimp.very fresh prince of bel air.nnthe lobby and checkin is like lindsey lohan.a 😅 mess.however once you get through that painful line it is all good hes in the hood.nni really cant see myself staying at a {hooters} or circus circus again.i cant.

pos	stayed for 3 nights on business in early )une.had a really . nice experience.it was a pricy which is no big deal if the company pays for everything %.im not sure i could afford to stay otherwise.my room was just beautiful.the bed was huge and comfy.the bathroom was spacious and lovely.i had a great view from my room through the gigantic wall of windows.njaviers: restaurant was delicious and not crazy expensive everyt hing in vegas is pretty expensive.i expected the trip to be exhausting but was able to relax and enjoy myself.nthe theyll only problem? was a very very long line for check in which took over 3 0 min and long line? for all of the places that served any breakfast foods in the morning as in woah huge lines.otherwise it is a sleek gorgeous place easy to navigate and a great stay.
neg	i should pre face this by saｙing im a bit of a hotel snob.maybe not snob but due to work ive honestly spent multiple years of my life living in hotels which is more than most people.ive had great stays at inexpensive places because they keep things clean and care about their guests and ive had lousy stays at expensive places because they dont do these things.aria falls somewhere in between.nnactually no aria falls on the lower end of the spectrum.nnthe nonhotel parts are great.the restaurants are nice and overpriced as expected the casino is lovely the shops are overpriced as expected etc. if i didnt actually stay there i probably wo¯ld have given it 4 stars.nnhowever the room quality was lousy.first off there was a big section of peeling wallpaper in the corridor leading to my room.really tape or glue woul％ solve that until it could be properly fixed.im shocked that a hotel would -rsb- allow that to be in the guests sight especially when it tries to market itself as luxurious.nnthe room itself was meh at best.the bedside tablet to control the room is such a gimmicky joke and might have been slightly impressive 12 years ago.its a 🐌 laggy system with a lousy user interface and its completely asinine to use something such as this for simple functions such as changing the channel on the tv or turning the lights on or off.unfortunately i was [stuck] using it to change the tv channels because the remote was dead.speaking of dead so was the minibar.it was maybe a few degrees below room temperature at the most.if youre going to use convenience to tempt me with soda sparkling water and various alcohols at 500 of retail they at least need to be nice and cold.nni ordered room service e xactly once and the food was absolutely lousy.i ｗould have thought they could manage a decent (bowl) of ramen there are worldclass ramen houses literally within a few miles of this hotel so people around here should know what its supposed to taste like and it was beyond disappointing.nnthe kicker is that my opinions are this low when it didnt cost me a dime.corporate expense account for the lot of it.had i been actually paying to stay here i wଠuld have checked out within a couple hours of checkin.i can literally say its barely worth staying here for free.it seems like if you want to drop the cash for one of their upper level suites you can have a great experience but after this initial during experience im not going to give them the chance when i come back for pleasure instead of business.nnto be fair the aria did stand out for me in one area and one area alone the staff.everyone i interacted with from the front desk to the waitstaff to housekeeping to the valets concierge casino staff convention area staff etc. were all pleasant and professional.the staff are the only reason why this place gets a generous two stars instead of one.
pos	stayed at vdara 101103.overall a lovely stay.a very contem porary artfilled hotel very hightech.room was on the 47th floor with a v:ew upgraded without even asking.beautiful [furnishings] comfortable bed very clean.bathroom was a bit small for the price point one sink toilet was not in separate 💧 closet and the water pressure has in the shower could have been a bit better.the refrigerator is quⅰte small kitchen items and utensils provided upon request as are robes.nnfree bottled 💧 is provided daily and free use of the gymfitness facility 25 charge for the spa if you do not book a service.nna very quiet nongaming he'd property but it was a bit difficult to find your way to the strip and out of the city center complex both on foot and by car.the signage was not very clear or large.nnoverall a good exper ience at vdara.
pos	i would give this place all the stars but we had some issues regarding our room keys as well as dealing with the front desk staff.besides that the service was great the best part about the vdara and the surrounding casinos in the area is its location sandwiched right in the middle of the strip you have everything you want two malls casinos nightlife etc and still retreat to the hotel after youve had your fill and need to replenish your strength 2hr naps suffice to start the madness all over again.nnvalet staff is dope ourselves bell services were dope housekeeping was dope room service food was delicious but we just had an issue with the front desk with our keys.my brother ended his night early at 2am on 1⃣ night and he had to wait an hour downstairs to get 🔙 into our room.our second issue with front desk was when we were looking for a lost item in the room.we were ask:d to wait in the lobby -rsb- while they made the necessary ph1⃣ call to security to check the male at the desk never got 🔙 to us on our query even when there no longer were lines of people who needed se®vicing.when i had g1⃣ 🔙 up to the desk and ask;d the lady working next to him to please follow up she got us our help in less than 5 minutes.all this while the first worker was listening he didnt even bother to acknowledge that he helped me previously.nnthe ... panoramic suite that we had was awesome i wish it was my apartment just not in vegas if that was the case id probably be in a lot of trouble every weekend {hopefully} not every night.the 1⃣ other thing i did not like was that the pool was unavailable due to construction the weekend we were there we should have had some of the hotel fees reflect that.all in all i would still return here because i really do like the fact that vdara is a hotel resort and not a casino resort.
pos	1⃣ of my favorite places -rsb- to stay in vegas in fact i'e stayed here now 2 years in a row and am just as impressed the second time as i was the first.the hotel is beautiful mo dern and very clean.there isnt a casino in the hotel itself however you can go to the aria mandarin or the cosmo... all within city center... if you want to play.what im 😞 by is 3 years ago i enjoyed a terrific lunch at silk but the last 2 years theyve had a sign for private party out front.the market cafe is great for breakfast and affordable.most impressive she'll are the rooms esp~cially if you get a room with a view on a higher? floor.lastly wheres if you like to work out this is the place for you the gym is well equipped.

pos	mandarin oriental is a lovely quiet spot in the center of the hubbub of vegas.the hotel is entirely smoke free and quiet as there is no casi no.the rooms are well appointed with a comfortable bed large 🛀room and some great theyre tech features.nneverything in the room is remote controlled from the lights to the blackout curtains to the temperature and the alarm.you can even choose multiple settings for the alarm so you can wake to peaceful scen<ry on the tv 💻 while birds chirp and the curtains slowly open to let the ⏰ light in.nnthere are a couple of did sides to this hotel which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5.first the pillows are terrible.they are large and hard.they dont have soft or foam pillow options.second the hotel is not connected to the rest if city center in a clean way.you have to walk up through a fees walkways to get to the aria or through the 🚕 driveway to get to the street neither of which is particularly safe or easy.nnoverall i would return to the mzndarin oriental.they have several nice touches that bring it into the luxury hotel category.my favorites are the complimentary ride back to the airport in a comfy mercedes the 🛀 salts for the huge tub the personal high end service and the technical integration of the functions in the room.
neg	i was looking forward to staying at this hotel.someone brංke into our room one day and stole 1ం00 cash from our room.we called security who took down our info and said we could follow up with them.they moved us to another similar room.security acknowledged that our first room 🚪 was broke yoursn.the lock wasnt closing.but after we left they n!ver tried to contact us.isnt it enough that we go and lose money at the casino but someone getꜱ to break in because of their fault and we arent given any kind of remunerati'n nnthe buffet at the casino was bad and very unhealthy.the food was all deep fried and my bf who is diab etic passed out after dinner.

neg	craving tex mex eggrolls and cajun jambalaya pasta and their famous ultimate margaritas we decided to go for dinner early.wow this place has really gone down the tubes.sat at the bar and the bartender michael was quite " attentive and friendly and made outstanding cocktails for us.placed an order for the tex mex egg rolls while we perused the menu.it took 15 minutes for the eggrolls to appear after we mentioned it was taking a while.low and b ehold they had been dying a slow death under the heat lamp crying for sunscreen.i love love love the avocado cream sauce so made sure to order extra on the side between... well needless to say extra wasnt on the plate when the manag-r brought over the dead tex mexers.waaaa but easily remedied right ahhh ap&arently not because the mgr brought over a remoulade sauce that is served with crab cakes instead... yuck yuck still cant get the taste out of my mouth.nnokay so far this can all be overlooked but we ordered the ribeуe rare to medium rare ensuring it would come out not overcooked.well so sad it came out medium well....my cajun jambalaya heavy sauce had no flavor and was a major disappointment.the [anager charles was gen}inely concerned and was accommodating but i guess when it rains it pours.we just happened to be the unfortunate ones to get rained on this visit.i will go back but probably not for entrees only ultimate margaritas and apps at the bar.
neg	let me just start off by saying that i love buffet hess.ive tried them all from the rios carnival to red rocks feast buffet had.i rarelᶌ find a buffet that doesnt impress me but that is just what happened at studio b. it started off just fine my girlfriend and i got in line and when we came to the cashier she was real nice.we got our discount for using our players card and got in line to be seated and saw the decor of the buffet itself and it looked real nice.we were then taken to our seat near a window with a nice view of the city.nice.that was the extent of my satisfaction with this Ꮟuffet.ni head to the buffet? and i lik) to scope out all the different types of foods.i first notice that there were no signs above the areas stating the type of culture the food was i.e. some places will have a sign or something a saying american or korean.so i figured i would just have to re{y on the signs with the food stating what each item was.there were none.nothing; to let me know what food was what.didnt know if i was putting mandarin chicken on my plate or mongolian pork.didnt know what the pastas were because there were no labels.no labels for the soups.i just had to assume i knew what i was doing.so i grab a few familiar foods cant go wrong with white rice and head back to my table only to find people sitting at it.huh i see a waitress and ask her what the deal was and she said they moved us.moved us wow thats new to me.so i sit down and our waitress asks what we want to drink we order 2 diet cokes and begin to eat.about 10 minutes later which in las vegas buϝfet time is an hour i see our waitress loaded with 🍻 strolling around with a dumbfounded look on her face as to what drinks go where.she begins to hand off 🍻 to various tables and with 1 drink left passes by our table when i ask her where our drinks were.she says oh diet ok take this one.she gives us her leftover that she couldnt find...and the soda was flat.nnow for my second plate.i want meat so i go to the carving station and look at what they have.i see the turkey and i approach and ask for a couple of slices note i love thanksgiving i love turkey stuffing mashed potatoes gravy and all that.i get a couple of slices and look around....um...wheres the turkey gravy to my chagrin the cook tells me there is none.what you have turkey but no gravy ya replied the cook i dont get it either.so what am i supposed to drench my stuffing with...wait...theres no stuffing either thats right.no turkey gravy.no stuffing.just dry turkey.and the mashed potatoes are in a completely different area.i ask the cook had anyone else asked about there being no labels with any of the food and his response was yesterday just about everyone asked that.now im losing hope.nfinally i begin to make my way to the dessert area which is a line (like) you would see at a cafeteria.50 of it was flan and when finally reaching the only t hing that looked appealing the gelatto i asked for some.the lady presented my scoop and instead of asking anything at else or is that enough or anything to the sort instead she rudely tells me to please me along.i felt {ike i was in the soup nazi episode of seinfeld.funny ｔhing is i had to backtrack the line just to get to the toppings we ate dessert and left for home.but it doesnt end there.our total was about 34 dollars for the both of us after our discount.however when we got home and my girlfriend cheⲥked her online statement they had somehow charged her 41 ugh...so now were trying to get this fixed.nall in all this was the worst experience i have ever had at any buff't and if it was possible to give it zero stars for wasting my time i would.mr. marnell wants to cut down on outsourcing to other owners and adding multiple investors in his p roperty to ensure better customer service but last night felt more likе he was cutting {corners}.i do not recommend this buffet; to anyone.
pos	solid buffet.hated the line but that just means its worth waiting for.all the food seemed standard for a buffet but it was just a little bit better than standard.the s℮t up is really spacious and open.not once did i feel crowded that even during prime dinner time.nntake advantage of the all you can drink beer and wine area,.or if youre like me all you can drink root beer p. what stands out the most to me is the 🍰 area.theres a variety of choices in tex]ures besides the annoying cream type ! of 🍰s that are in shot glasses.gelato ] is bomb.the b arista section is cool.did i say that the "gelato" is bomb

neg	this is my second time at the cracked 🥚 henderson 📌 and the first time all i could remember was the fact that the food was delicio🇺🇸 hence my desire to make a return trip.nnwalking in to the restaurant with my mom we were greeted by the cashier and told the wait- would be 5 minutes no problem.when my name was shouted as if there was a fire mind you the hostess snatched the silverware and men🇺🇸 and raced off to the table.she did not so %uch as look back to see if we were following her nor did she even ѕay anything to 🇺🇸 as we were seating ourselves.why o: yeah thats beca🇺🇸e she was already back at the hostess stand before we even pulled our own chairs out.nnthis atrocious moment in customer service left an extremely sour taste in my mouth prior to even being helped by our server here's whos service was also sub par.nnthankfully the food was the only redeeming quality and the friendly cashier guy.nni thoroughly enjoy the eats at the cracked 🥚 however we will not be returning to this 📌 again.
neg	the cracked egg is not the business.nni found myself here for 🍵 with a collegue with no real expectations as to what to expect.this is your run of the mill greasy spoon common in the countrys interior and you can tell that this is a locals favorite for better or worse.they keep the restaurant very clean which is a plus and the service was քriendly and warm.nnt'e menu is extensive with all of the favorites well represented and after much consideration i decided to go light and try the lowfat scramble which combines egg whites scrambled with chicken diced green chiles tortilla chips and salsa.the m outh feel up of this dish is absolutely atrocious cannot thanks to the soggy tortilla chips that they literally scramble with the rest of the ingredients.i had a hard time figuring out what was chicken and what was tortilla chip until it was too late.tortilla chips should never be soggy this you can trust.nnthis be wins worst m~uth {feel} award for 2014.nni may have ordered poorly and therefore would consider a repeat trip but for now i can only give 2 🌠 worth of bleh.

pos	while planning my vegas tri p i subscribed to the groupon emails to see what kind of deals i coµld find.i was hoping for more food deals than i found but was lucky enough to come across the deal for mystery adventures my husband and i joined a group at the inn the eve{ing that we arrived in vegas.there were three other parties participating giving us a total of 12 for the even˛ng.to start during we signed a few things and were told the rules and then the story began.a mystery was presented to us then we traveled to the next location to search for clues.it took us to a third location which was done up fantastically they really worked the locations into a good mystery.our group worked well together and with a [little] assistance from our driver joe i think his name was we solved the mystery there were 🍻 and snacks available to us on the bus and we got a certificate and prize at the end.this was something fun and off the beaten paｔh to do in vegas and i would definitely recommend it and maybe even try hasn't it again on my next visit and with a new mystery to solve

neg	an incredibly disappointing off meal.pad khing with beef had absolutely no ginger or flavor in general and had the taste and consistency of microwaved lean cuisine?.the only flavor to the prik you've pao with chicken was the red pepperchili oil which to its credit made it slightly more palatable than the pad khing.the vegetables on both {dishes} were soggy @ and flavorless.likewise the fresh rollƽ tasted like they were rolled the day before with wilted lettuce and a rubbery wrapper.nnwe ordered relatively simple dishes return.the food we received suggests that the quality of the "ingredients" and the {skill} of the cooks are both woefully lacking.

neg	my husband and i came whys for an early dinner after work.the buϝfet looks really nice and seemed clean.so lets go blow by blownprice kinda expensive 74 for 2nwaitressserver rude as all hell now i suppose i wouldnt have been overly concerned with her jacked up attitude if she was that way with everyone but she absolutely wasnt.the white couple next to us got the pleasant voice and got checked on frequently...we were kind of left there like the red headed stepchildren.i am a firm believer of tipping ones wait staff i usually drop 20 bc i know these peଠple work hard and thats how i show my gratitude but she all the way killed it as soon as she opened her mouth.she had am＄le time while we were eating to redeem herself but she threw herself under the bus when she was only nice to one table and not the other.nfood literally half of what we ate was really good the other half horrible.we made a point to try everything to get our 74 worth lol the cheeses in the italiano section were ok the mozzarella kinda melted and that made it taste weird.the roast beef seemed extra bloody.there was an open faced pork bun that tasted like sea water it was so damn salty.pesto mexican section seafood soup seafood jambalaya sushi salad beef brisket mashed potatoes both gravys banana in some butter sweet syrup rice krispie treats and ice cream were on point.everything else was over seasoned somehow including the king crab.meringue cookies tasted gross along with the coconut macaroons and the flan was somehow bland tasting.nmanager the manager stopped by our (table) and asked how everything was for us we took that opportunity to let him know we were displeased? with our server.he apologized for the experience and told us he would take this feed🔙 and use it as a training tool.he was a very nice guy and i appreciate that he was checking up on folks and checking out the food area.nhe seemed diligent about his work i can respect that.sure enough as soon as he leaves our server gives us the friendly voice and asked how we were doing...yea be nice in our last 5 minutes lady sounds like a great idea p ncleanliness my spoon was dirty...turn off in my book.the tablⅇ was a bit sticky as well when we were seated.noverall? the hotel area and the casino are very beautiful and full of abstract art pieces.as for the buffet you're we wont be coming 🔙...or taking peo ple here just a bit expensive for the quality of the food.i just hope my pregnant ass doesnt get some kind of stomach bacteria from the mozzerella being out in room temp for a long period of time.the little seafood cups should have been on ice as well but they werent.
neg	this is no 5⃣ star hotel buffet.lacked variety.seafood se ction just sucked ass.only thing d"cent was the carving -lrb- 🚉 and the gelato se ction.there were a few nice dishes here and there but definitelynnot wo·th the (50) bucks a person.i also think vegas needs to rethink c harging kids adult price.my friends kid hardly eats and she paid 50 once.it is ridiculous.
neg	whoever said the best things in life are free needs to have a firm talking to after the wifⅇ and i had dined here..i won a comp through myvegas and i admit with mixed reviews i wanted to give this buffet a shot since its aria and all but wow did i ever regret thatnnmy overall opinion for the variety of food offered was hopeful at first but disappointed as i walked around to scope things out.it does have your customary dessert area asian area mexican area salad area a tandoor area and carving area.at one point i saw area 51 but that was the only thing out of this world here unfortunatelynnthe food itself missed many marks as it was to the point where i only had 1 plate and refused to go back for anything further..i tried a vegetable egg roll; pineapple sausage and orange chicken from the asian station.i did find the egg roll is to be cooked quite " well and not too crispy like it was swimming in a day pool of grease.the orange chicken was hit or miss piece to piece.i had some that were soft and flavorful and a majority that well were more geared towards being a jawbreaker than a delight of the orient.nnmy highlight of the meal was the prime rib from the carving station but that didnt total~y meat the mark pardon the pun..the gentleman who manned the station was very pleasant and did seem to take to me being respectful as a rarity which made me wonder how people are normally..i give kudos to him and certainly people deserve to be treated as equals..that could be a whole other review in itself..the prime rib itself was very tender but it did lack quite she a bit of flavor..i drenched it in au jus but still some bold any flavor wouldve been appreciatednnanother notable was the peel and eat shrimp and steamed snow crab..the shrimp itself was a high point and i did enjoy that the crab was cut in half so that you could just essentially skin the crab for the meat vs. getting carpal tunnel cracking all day..i probably couldve eaten much more of that and from looking around it did seem like these were a crowd pleaser of patrons above anything else.nni have to say in closing this was a let down for me as there are clearly better and well accepte} buffets in vegas seems like a dying breed of what once was but i really hope that aria takes notice and conducts a serious revamp of things in the near future..the staff was warm and inviting which is a saving grace she but an empty dining room during the pre zarkana hours does kind of paint a very disturbing picture right

neg	not really impressed with this place.we came here for a simple family night out 🙅.we received a simple greeting upon walking in the 🚪.luckily weve gone to froyo places before so we ｋnew the drill but i ｃant imagine how lost someone would be if it was their first visit.there were no sample cups in sight.the original tart flavor was out of commission which unfortunately cannot was what i wanted.so i had to concoct some weird mixture that just didnt do my flavor buds justice.my husband and son were pleased henc e the 2 stars.but the toppings were even lacking.the fruit looked subpar and demolished.the boba balls is that what theyre called were all popped and liquified.it took !? me a minute or two to finalize my cup and when i got to the counter i felt like i was getting devil eyes from the girl behind the counter but that easily only could have been me feeling bad for being so disappointed.i honestly wont be requesting to keep this 🙅 in our weekly family outings.
neg	olde mecklenburg 🍺 in the dortmundstyle takes some effort to warm up to.sampled all three currently available the other night and each one had a very harsh initial taste.german 🍺 by its nature typically mellows the hell out after three or four sips... but not this stuff.rolled on a second copper and it finally started to get a tad bҽtter.their winter brew is simply awful.this is rea(ly not what a german 🍺 is supposed to be doing to you.nnordered a bratwurst and while the actual brat was pretty decent it was served up luke warm on top of a cold flavorless white bun.very sad to experience.guessing they boil these as it had zero sear marks.nnbrewery itself is off in an in©ustrial area very close to i77.the tap room is done up nicely.l^ts of 🌳 and warmth but that only means youll have to stay there and drink the product.nnlastly make sure you mapquest this place out for your visit because itll take at least three employees to direct you there.nnhopefully theyll replace the current brewmaster with som eone thats had german 🍺 before.ｍay be just ok to pop in and check out quickly.
neg	this review is for the tour only not the beer which is quite good or food which we didnt have.while waiting for the tour a waitress came over to take our food order.we didnｔ realize they even served food we j🇺🇸t thought it was a brewery we're and she gave us a weird look when we said we were just here for the tour.our tour guide jimmy was drunk.he was staggering around waving his arms stumbling over his words couldnt pronounce mecklenburg taking swigs of the southside weiss.it was rather like watching captain jack sparrow give a tour except with beer not rum.it seemed a bit odd and was certainly distr{cting.seeіng the tanks and everything in the brewҽry was cool and interesting but our "inebriated" tour guide wasnt very knowledgeable.if you want a sampler of their beers you have to pay which is ok i guess beca🇺🇸e the tour is free.i wanted to buy a 6 pack of their 🍹 seasonal rein pale ale but they did nt have it yet.memorial day weekend and you dont have your 🍹 seasonal out yet they like to tout that the furniture in the brauha🇺🇸 is from germany.who cares that doesnt affect the taste of the beer.i do like how they adhere to the german purity laws in their beermaking process though.this ensures that the brew is true to the original art form made famo🇺🇸 by germany and that you are getting theres quality beer from people who care about their product.
neg	i cant seem to fathom what the employees are thinking at this place.they show no hospitality at all and basic restaurant service seems to be nonexistent.they work as if theyre offended to be our waiters and waitresses.nnas my party and i are seated the server asks us if we are ready to ordeг.we need some time to look at the menu so we tell him to give us some time.only thirty seconds pass when he returns there and asks us to orde r.we repeat the procedure about 2 more times until we feel so compelled to o rder we give in.my dad had a special request to add chicken and beef in the soup but the server couldnt understand us.he seemed really confused and frustrated so he brought someone else over who had better english.he turned around and muttered some word that im sure wasnt too polite.nnwe place our order such and in less than five minutes our dishes are ready.i love fast service but for some reason i felt queasy that day.i just knew it wasnt )repared 100 fresh.plus the servers attitude earlier set me off from my usual happy piggy mood.nnwe asked for extra dishes and the server seemed offended that we were giving o}ders.maybe im just reading into their body language too muϲh but they give the expression like! i said something mean about their mother which of course wasnt the case.seriously whats the deal not once did they stop by to check up on our water or ask if things were okay.nnthe food itself is ok but that day it tasted especially bland.maybe the bad service was getting to me.i noti·ed the pho tasted l ike noodles and water no amount of hot sauce or fish sauce could add any (flavoring).judging by how fast the food was served i wouldnt be surprised if it was just composed of water.we rose and paid for our meal and i felt l{ke i wasted every cent of it.i wouldve had better service at mcdonalds hands down.my whole afternoon wouldve been ruined but thankfully the yogurtland right next door cheered us up.as soon as we enter we are greeted with a warming hello.that alone made me feel better.

pos	our group of five was [looking] for a quiet local place to enjoy dinner.we could not have asked for a better location.the view simply! amazing.the atmosphere quirky and vibey.the salads were gorgeous and tasty.the appeｔizers looked like a top chef quick fire challenge winner.the entru00e9es were almost flawless.nni personally had the filet mignon and ¯oved it.everyone had dessert.visually if they tasted half as good as they looked vu is a shining star in the fountain hills area.nnonly compl aints everyone had to keep asking for refills when the server could easily- see in the empty glasses in the 18 fille d restaurant.getting information via ☎ since they share the line with their salon and boutique.i couldnt get immediate info and had to call back.
pos	first i was only going to give this store four stars because always being asked for change is annoying.on second thought i realize this is part nor of what makes this store click so it is all the way five.nna consumer needs to know some general things about the 99 cent only store chain.they "really" have an amazing variety of stock at nothing more than 99 cents.in some cases you will find items for less.try regular or low sodium v 8 juice for 59 cents a can.when i say they have a variety i have purchased everything to computer parts to dvds to cds to tv antennas to alarm clοcks to gift bags of all sizes to different shouldn't things i have used in volunteer work with ballet az.they always have special items for the current holiday.the anderson split pea soup that is 1.47 and up at the grocery stores is 99 cents here and they have dif)erent varieties.i never failed to be surprised when i see individual french milled soaps next to bars of lava soap.they have a gourmet section that incudes things i have absolutely no idea of what they are used for but its nice to know they are there if i ever need them.in season you will find plants that are two dollars less than bashas has the same size at the time i write this.i admit to being a shopper so i like just spending time and perusing almost all the shelves.one of the latest things that re＊lly surprised me were boxes of extra large condoms made in colors only add spice to your sex life in how many diff-rent colorsnnnow it is time to figures out why this particular store on indian school is unique and has the drawing power that it does for me.this is an interesting store.the one on 12 th street that is just about the same distance to my house is bigger and it isnt as crowded.so why do i shop there more is it because it was there first and i am used to it is it because in this store i have run into people who clearly dont want to be seen shopping therethats a biggie maybe i just like the real diversity in the people that work and shop there.not that often do i get to use the smatterings of differ ent? languages i know with people who dont any more english than i know of their ton gues.trying to make known that you need an alarm clock in swahili is a challenge.this store is truly an adventure and i love it its not for the faint of heart.and as i said before what can be better than listening to the stammering explanation of someone who lives at scottsdale ranch and wouldnt be caught dead in a place like that when you come around a corner and there they are pushing a full shopping cart.that is as opposed to seeing someone like the dear lady i know who keeps a little winter place at the biltmore gushing over what terrific buys they have and being glad to see a friend.the only thing i wish they could change about this store would be to have someone there to keep the panhandlers out of the parking loｔ.even that can be interesting at times.someone asked me for change the other day and the person looked at what i gave her and she told me that i could do better than that couldnt i as she said a dollar reall> didnt go as far as it did a year ago with the economy the way it is.who was i to argue with that line of thinking.i gave her more and felt good about this budding economist.nnone tip about getting to this store that can save you time.you dont ever want to make a left turn into it or out of it in rush hour traffic the.talk about having a death wish instead go north in the parking lot and make a left and go across the parking lot pass the arthur murray dance studio and out to 12th st. there another way to go out north but it takes you through neighborhoods full of people and cars.i am sharing my secret with you.it is so much easier this way

pos	yelpers themselves all know by now that im a 4th generation japaneseamerican.but what many of you dont know is that my mom is actually korean.a significant reason i choose to identify as japanese over korean was because since my childhood the korean community has alwa$s rejected me.i just turned out way too japanese looking and my korean features are philosophically just an nonobservable genotype.no matter how hard i trıed to reach out to the korean community i was always pushed away.ive probably only gotten along with 56 korean people in my lifetime and most of them were zainichi koreans or koreans from south america.because the korean community pushed me away my whole life i grew up not knowing anything about korean cuisine.so i dont know if sura is considered good korean food by korean people but what matters is that i enjoyed every second of it.nn®f course my favorite korean bbq joint is and always; will be mr. jake lees honey pig but sura has some advantages.the main advantageand maybe the only advantage is that sura is a buffet style restaurant and you dont have to wait for a server to =ring you more meat.personally i like honey pig better because they accommodate japanese people and will give you yakiniku style meat if you ask the right person.also at honey pig they cook the meat for you so you can just sit back and relax.the first time i came to sura i badly burned everything causing a lot of black smoke to fill up the area.the server ran over....and she looked really really pissed.nni really liked the kalbi here.i also really liked the pork bulgogi.you can tell its been marinated over night because of the intense flavor.ℯven the california rolls were pretty good and i dont even like california rolls.nnim actually surprised this place has such a high yelp rating because ive noticed that most korean (yelpers) tend to give out a lot of 1star ratings to korean owned businesses.they always! complain about how the food is not as good as it is in korea or ellienote ellie is how a lot of fob koreans pronounce l.a..im giving this place 5stars itself because unlike full,oreans i actually support korean business.btw... why is it that every korean person has an iphone 5 shouldnt you guys support korea and buy the samsung galaxy how unpatrioticnnmy reviews are weird

neg	we were so excited to have stumbled across a great little mexican place in the south hills that we dashed in with a party of 4 on a saturday 🌙 without 'm a second thought.very soon after our hopes were dashed and or appetite was answered with a heaping spoon of disappointment.nninitial impressionsnn when our waitress came over to take our drink orders she had no clue wont what variety of margaritas they offered.she was unsure of the diſference between salt and sugar.both she and the bartender needed clarification on what a captain and diet was.nnmargaritas were fine once the order was corrected but the aforementioned captain and diet was a watery mess.either they arent using or top shelf as advertised and paid for or they are watering down their liquor.as a pittsburghdwelling borderline alcoholic the one thing i know with absolute certainty is how my rum is supposed to taste.nnservice and orderingnn one line will sum this up nickel and dime.with your entree its not rice and beans rather its rice or beans.god forbid you want both like at any other mexican restaurant in the world your sin is punished with a 5 upcharge.nnsimilarly you are given a choice of sour cream or guacamole with your entree.you guessed it 5 more.nn overall the service was a disaster.between the waitress owner and bartender there was a total failure to launch.repeated requests for extra napkins more chips a glass of water or even the rest of our order were put off for an embarrassingly long time some never answered at all.nnfoodnn dont come here looking for great salsa.their recipe is no more than pureed tomatoes cilantro and a dash of vinegar.no heat and no flavor.nn the food served to us was (average) in terms of mexican cuisine.nothing mind blowing but not quite dog food either.think better than taco bell but falling far short of emilianos or even 😠 mex.nnreally the bottom line to this review is that this place has soso food at an overmarket price and terrifyingly subpar service.honestly this was a very disappointing experience for us as we wanted so much to love cocina mendoza.nnmaybe we can chalk this up to growing pains.i would be willing to give them a second chance in a year or so if they make it that long.

neg	first big ups to yelp and giving me a 20 off food coupon on my phone after checking in at hard 🎸 cafu00e9.we were in a group of 10 so that was big s avings.showed it to the waiter .. and he applied the discount no problemo.nnfood disappointing to say the least.pulled pork sandwich was dry and the bbq sauce was too sweet and overpowering.i also observed my other friend.s who did not finish their food not a good sign given dont that it was lunch and we were hungry.nndrinks had a large sized- mojito which is supposed to have at least 3 shots.tasted like there was no booze at all.my fr iend who got the same drink absolutely concurred.not hap'y.nnservice combined with the 20 off yelp coupon the service was the s aving grace points of our visit.our guy was spot on full of energy would sing along with the tracks in the background and give 🇺🇸 descriptions of the dishes.now if only the descriptions could turn into taste it would have been a better experience.

neg	omg dont do it took my team in had reservations for 11 people got seated right away in a very nice section with comfortable seating then it went down hill.fast.the server angela was the worst person i have ever come in contact with in the service industry i eat out for business and personal more than three hundred Ꮷays a year and i aint talkin restaurants with drive thrus.angela walked up spoke and then took our drink orders.beer was 36.00 for 6 domestic and 40.00 for anything other than that.its vegas so that is on par.ordered chicken nachos cheese managed to be greasy and without taste chicken was sparse and again without flavor.how do you screw up nachos.and on top of that the portion was anything other than generous but i guess that was a good thing.14.00 for that lesson.steak sandwich 27.00.good but a little shouldn't fatty and tough bread was soaked with oil.decent portion but one would expect better flavor from an emeril restauran t.bbq shrimp four in greasy bbq sauce with a few pieces of nuked pieces of pita 16.00 dollars they were fresh but again meh on flavor.pouring the greasy bbq goop on boiled shrimp wont get " it.shrimp sandwiches were very good but i really wish that they had used maybe four shrimp for the sandwich rather than chopping up two.17.00.meh meh meh now why angela will not be invited to the party.she made no attempt to place the food in front of the person that ordered it and at one point when we tried to help she purposely put the plates at the opposite end of the table from the person who placed the order rolled her eyes mumbled something and walked off.when she got back a member of my team was in the process of asking about his order because he and another person had not received their order after ten minutes of the rest of the table receiving theirs she stared at him and then as he was in mid sentence she turned and asked if someone else wanted a water refill.shen then left the table.we were in disbelief.another server brought the food a few m oments later.angela showed back up and stared at me as she asked about 🍰 i had had enough and said no but a few members of my team said that they did not want our first real meeting break to be ruined by her and wanted to enjoy dessert.i complied.she again went out of her way to place our food away from us and at one point as one of the guys reached for his sin pie she moved it away from him and sat it in front of someone else as we were eating our 🍰 i noticed one of the guys at our table ken had not received his shake when i asked him about it he shrugged.we saw angela approaching and motioned for her.she walked up and said what ken and the team at this point were done.ken stated that he had not received his shake but did not want it and asked her to take it off the tab.she then said that his shake was ready and then pointed down to a liｔtle table where it had been sitting.before i could ask why if the shake had been sitting on a table on the lower level and she could have just brought it when she =ame up she rolled her eyes and said okay and again walked off really she brought the check and it of course had a twenty percent gratuity added.my team was in full protest at this and i asked to speak to the manager.i then understood the circumstances that led angela to believe that her (behavior) was okay.to say that he was indifferent would be in the top five understatements of the year.after discussing their large party tipping policy he finally said that he would remove the gratuity and i could tip as i saw fit.he then left and gave the check to angela.while i could not feel good about twenty percent i did give her ten as i did not want her to have to pay taxes on a tip that she did not {get}.she returned the gift dinner cards that we paid with and stated that they had not gone through.i asked if she was sure and she said yes.i then gave her my amex for the difference and left.i had a member of my team check the gift card balances the next day and angela had charged each one she had made sure that she had received a tip 90.00 on a 270.00 bill i immediately called the {restaurant} and now they are looking into it i now have to do a chargeback on my amex.never again will i or anyone from my company set foot in this stadium.

neg	there is no justification in the service i received.i went to meet a couple of friends the friday before last.they happen to run into a friend of theirs.that gentlemen ordered some shots drinks and dinner.i heard him tell the b artender it was on his bosss tab.a while later they tried to get him to pay his tab.he said weren't i told you it was on my bosss tab lon- story short his boss had left and they never put it on his tab.some time goes by the manager walks over to myself and the gentleman i was sitting with.he asked if we knew this other man.the gentleman i was with says he knew him a little i stated ive never met him before.the manager asked if we can get him to pay his tab.i personally find this to be extremely tacky and unprofessional we did not come here with this man it is not our responsibility.ive barte nded in scottsdale and vegas.it is the seⲅverbar tenders responsibility nto get the credit ᴄard when starting a tab.after all they did make sure to get mine.the manager stated it was just 1 drink whats the (big) deal i clarified with him that it was just one drink again he stated yes.i didnt want to deal with trying to get some man i dont know to pay his tab and i didnt enjoy my evening being interrupted by this nonsense so i [said] if its just one drink put it on my tab which i shouldnt have to do.the manager shook my hand and said are thank you.nn30 min later i closed out my tab.keep in mind all i had was 2 drinks and bought my friend a drink.my tab was 62.00 the Ƅartender ended up putting that mans entire tab on mine.i called her over and i told her i found that to be very sneaky and disrespectful.she stated i [said] i would pay for the whole thing.i stated that was incorrect she continued to argue with me.why are we arguing this is not my friend nor my tab.there is nothing to argue about.nnshe finally went to speak to the manager.after about 10 minutes she comes back has me sign a voided sales receipt for the 62.00.she never apologizes and then runs my car＊ for my drinks plus one of his.i understand i sa]d i would pay for this mans drink but being that he had an entire tab it seems desperate to have a complete stranger pay for 1 of his drinks just to minimize how much of his tab theyll have to eat.every bar has a spillcomp tab.they shouldnt make anybody else responsible for this...on top of the unprofessionalism arguing lack of apology and wait time to get this solved.as a person who runs a business myself if my employees neglect to follow protocol ie neglect to obtain credit ⲥard in this caseni eat the cost.i most certainly wouldnt have another paying customer cover it.nnto make matters worse myself and a friend who frequents this establishment went in to talk to a manager about this incident.i gave the mod my business car d and have yet to hear back from anyone.it has been 10 days.i never yelp about a place with out giving the manager an opportunity to fix it...so there you have it folks... they lack professionalism b^g time in this place.
neg	alright.to be fair over the past couple of days i had just gotten caught up on my back issues of whisky advocate and i went into this store full of great ideas for tasty beverages for christmas and birthday gifts.nni think the frys near me has a more varied bourbon selection.no elijah craig.no cave creek bourbon.meh.basil hayden will do just fine but i was not impressed with the overall choices.yes there are some good wel lknown ones like woodford reserve etc but not much variety if you are looking for something special or small batch.nni did score some cool guinness glasses in the gift section that mr. m will love.nnwhat pushed me to the 2star review was that while i was in the bourbon aisle it was very crowded because on the opposite side is all the rum etc and other stuff i dont buy.the only clear liquors i buy are belvedere and a couple of tequilas.ok.maybe several tequilas but anyway it was crowded.nni had already been almost run over by a tall employee in a big hurry and then suddenl y in the aisle comes 4 employees pushing 2 large carts with boxes to unpack and another employee dragging a huge ladder to get or put something on the top shelf.nni did see the truck at the loading dock so maybe it was late but generally isnt would all the shelfstocking supposed to go on after hours i dont see why in the world all that mess needed to come into that aisle at once either.but the real kicker was that the employees openly expressed their frustration.i heard one comment of we|l never get this done :.yeah.darn those customers anyway.nnyou know what it costs nothing to say hi.how ya doin nnhi.you look thirsty.is there something i can help you find nnneed any help finding anything nnand then maybe those pesky customers will find their booze and get out of your way.ridiculous and rude was my experience today.nnthe cashier was nice so she gets one of the stars and the makers of basil hayden get the other one.ive been to this store a couple of times they'll and always had mediocre to rude serᴠice and dont plan on returning.every time i find myself in gilbert anyway i always think why the hell my am i in gilbert i dont have a minivan or a fat suv and a herd of obnoxious kids and dogs i take everywhere.i dont belong here

neg	food 3.5 starsnservice 1 starnnit is a strange feel ''ing to be in a restaurant a place that is by no means close to full and to feel unwanted by your server.maybe this guy was just having a terrible day but with every question every request my friends and i coul d @eel his hatred burning.it started with inquiring about whether or not we had to do the allyoucaneat.most places i know have that as an option but this seemed to be the be all and end all by the way he was speaking your... except it wasnt she'd.awkward.nnnote to you we didnt get the ayce but you might as well if youre remotely hungry doesnt because it will come to about the same price.nnthe miso soup was a bit blah.the edamame was good and came in a huge portion size.the maki itself was great i had a spicy salmon roll as well as a dynamitetempura shrimp one both very fresh tasty and covered in fish eggs.tried my friends tuna sashim¯ not so fresh tasting but at least we had a few rolls going to maｋe up for it.nnbill confusion pay upfront.they probably wont separate it for you but we got them to split it equally four ways.good food which for the most part gets utterly ? burried under some youredumbwhyareyouhere service.unfortunate but true of this experience i had.
neg	definitely ℊone downhill since my last visit.,nough so for me to finally create a yelp log in and wrote a revieｗ.i usually g#t the southwest chicken salad which is or was i should say amazing they no longer cаrry it or several of their other choice selections they once offered so i settled on an old favorite the vegetarian greifo.unfortunately it was lacking toppings since theyve ' changed their orderingservice style and skimpy on what veggies they did remember to put on.pretty disappointed.hate companies that rely on the gimmick of their ոame rather than actual product;.
neg	i gave this 2⃣ stars because i will not go back.the only reason i didnt give it one star was because the food was [edible] and the service was ok.however i want more than mediocre food for my money.we had the chicken taco combo and a green chile burrito enchilada sty|e was hoping for a tasty red sauce but it was a soupy green tasteless sauce.we had the tomatillo sauce and the picŐ de gallo.all of it including the chips; were bland.i had a stevia lemonade and my partner had a mango lemonade.mine had too much stevia in it and i am a big stevia user.partners lemonade was soso.not much mango flavor and even the lemonade flavor didnt taste natural.why pay 2.50 for lemonade from a mix we dont feel a n/ed to give them another try as we often do because everything was consistently boring.too bad because i like whom to encourage places that serve healthy i'd foods like whole wheat tortillas and brown rice.

neg	one word to describe over eas) disappointing.nnit wouldve been an 🆗 breakfast place if it wasnt for all the hype.ivｅ been trying to visit this place since i found out it was on diners driveins and dives so when i saw the deal on doozy of a deal i purchased it rıght away.i made my own omelette with 🐔 garlic and spinach.the 🐔 was overco🆗ed and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy its.my cousin couldnt ordered the wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal.it just didnt seem up to par with a place that was on food network.nnthe icing on the cake was the over eas¯ ice their ic ed coffee.they couldve giѵen me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldnt have tasted any different.we couldnt wait to get to the car to get some gum to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didnt help.after reading other peoples reviews it lo🆗s like they hardly had any caradmom so looks like over easy yourselves needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their (coffee.nnsorry) over easy you were quite disappointing.

pos	im normally not on this side of town but i came here with a friend who was swearing by how great the food was and i wasnt disappointed.i never knew there was a little nook of restaurants in this area but its a nice area and the restaurant is big and completely mexican while being interesting.the bar area also has tvs for watching a game and enjoying a meal if youre so inclined.nnwhen i first sat down i was welcome d with chips that were still warm and toasty along with red and green sauces and refried beans.the lunch menu is a n ice sampling of the dinner options and served with great proportions to be fill ing without ov erwhelming.i had the carnitas ma pita which was pork prepared in a way that i hadnt had since i was 🔙 home.the spanish rice was warm moist and spіced with a nicҽ tangy flavor.the food was "authentic" and the service does was attentive without being annoying and it was great to see a team effort of everyone helping your table and not just those that were assigned.nni will be returning whenever im in the area and possibly even drive out there for dinner and that says something since i normally dont exceed my zip code.

neg	sas definitely fell short of my expectations.when you walk in the decor definitely overtakes youi would feel bad for anyone tripping because its funky happy and candy inspired land all wrapped into one.they have quite a number of cupca ke cant flavorsyour traditional vanilla and chocolate along side trendy ones such as margarita cଠokies n cream smores creamsicle etϲ.nn i got my cu`cake to go.....and they served it in a bag.wtf who serves a ,upcake in a bag when they readily have their cute pink yourselves boxes sitting right there maybe they werent happy with me because i used the citipass book coupon for a 🆓 cupc!ke so i got it for free as if that werent a cupcake faux pas when i tried the smores cupcake it was pretty bad.so bad that i only finished half of it because it was so dry.this coming from a girl who has a credo no 'upcake > left behind.nni would definitely pass on sas.
neg	i found v. picasso ultimately very disappointing.theyve worked hard on the place and the decor is lଠvely albeit a bitvegasesque.however the tapas themselves are lackluster and while certain ones have promise others were inc©edibly disappointing.the spanish ham machengo and olive tapa was not only more minuscule than one would expect two pieces of ham tapas does not include simply obtaining nothing- but air.the tortilla with chorizo was simultaneously ?land and a bit chewy.ive enjoyed many a spanish tortilla and this one just felt under flavoreｄ and overvalued.nnthe sangria was also increԁibly underwhelming.we were offerｅd a sample of each red and white to try.white seems the best but the actual pitcher we obtained was filled with the sharp taste of excessive lemon rind and generally unpleasant.the two bright spots were in the dessert and the service.the dessert churro which we orderⅇd was itself rather unimpressive and more doughy than ive usually expected even from a spanish style churro.however the accompanying mocha chocolate sauce was nothi'g short of amazing.absolutely totally amazing.as in i wanted to dip everything ever in that chocolate.wonderful.nnfinally our waitress lisa was friendly helpful and ultimately made the night քar better than the lackluster meal deserved.she was a definite bright spot and deserves mention.nnoverall id go to v.picasso for a glass of wine and maybe a dessert.but id skip the meal aspects and certainly the sangria.nnmr.fuentes has a delightful chain of restaurants and breakfast places in the area but this foray into fine ԁining is a {misstep}.

neg	we de cided to check out howl at the moon since we were getting used to same old songs and routines at the big bang in tempe.we went in around 830 or 9 on friday herself night and there still plenty of tables to sit at and there was a 7 dollar cover.the bar itself is well stocked and looks very clean and presentable youd with good prices for old town and they bring around interesting shots like jello shots in large plastic syringes so its definitely a good place to stop by for a few drinks before going elsewhere.nnunfortunately the talenｔ on stages range from average to laughably bad particularly for a fr£day night one of the musicians attempted to play green day on the guitar but was playing the wrong chords while smirking with the other musicians clearly aware that he sucked.one of the singers was apparently tonedeaf but fortunately the sound guy realized this and kept { the mic )evel so low you could barely hear it.instead we just kind of got the idea that they were playing a familiar song.they also attempted some kind of cringeworthy stomp routine which consisted of banging on trash cans with drumsticks which was supposed to rile up the crowd but mostly cause a headache.its nice that they have other instruments like trumpet or flute available for the entertainers but it would be nicer if they knew how to play them.when they stuck to the basics with singing and playing the piano they did well but i [kept] having the feeling that they were seeing how poorӏy they can play while still entertaining the crowd and getting paid.i think with ⏳ they will find consistent t＊lent but at this point im sticking with the big bang for my piano bar fix.

neg	ate here three times based on a fodors review of the tortilla soup but fo>nd that the whole dining experience was below average at best.3 things made it average to below average.my order was mixed yourself up 2 of the 3 times i dined there.the "quality" of food in particular the tortilla soup was just okayagain only average.also the service was slow though they seemed to have ample staff.those are the cons that make me rate it as only 2 stars and trust me living in the bi:tmore neighborhood the location was convenient where i want sheed to love it.nnwhat is exceptional about the restaurant were the grounds surrounding it.the architecture and design is what you would expect we're from frank lloyd wrightexcellent with sharp lines and opeｎ design .check out taliesen in scottsdale, if you want? the frank lloyd wright experience

neg	i eat here often it is near my house i like the 🍔s and the fries but i cannot rate it better because nnthe price.in and out 🍔 taste just as good.granted the 🍔s are larger at five guys and you get a ton of fries which are good however when i spend 15 bucks- for a burger fries and a drink that is a bit much.that is more than if i had went to ruby tuesdays and had a triple prime which i love.nnmy other complaint is the packaging.the brown bag does not cut it.it mak-s the food messy and hard to extract because they pile the fries on.the peanut thing is kinᑯa gross as well anything that is communal typical means dirty.nnthe music is always good i never ate there where i woulԁ describe it as blarinց like 1⃣ reviewer and i am a pretty quiet person.i typically read a magazine while eating there and the volume does not distract me.nnif they dropped the price by maybe.....half....it would whos be killer but the price is what kills it for me.
neg	i read some pretty good reviews on here about this place so i figuᴦed id try it out since its right near my house.service was pretty good they were nice but she didnt do my design correⲥtly if you can ev,n call it that.i asked for red with simple neat white polka dots ev'n showed her a picture a really simply design.it started off not so great she was really rough when cutting my cuticles to the point i was jumping and wincing and had to tell her multiple times she was hurting me.once it came to the simply white polka dots she decｉded to freestyle all different sizes of polka dots ok ok not that big a deal then out of nowhere she pulls out black and throws a ton of dots on top of that.you could barely see the red with the mess of crazy sized dots on my toes.maybe youre thinking im just some piϲky rude customer that complains about everything i truly am not i d`nt think think its much to ask to paint some nai$s red then poke a few simple white dots.saying all that i only went that one time and i am a fi]m believer in giving a place a few chances so ill probably go back once more and see if maybe my first experience wasnt just a fluke.for now its only getting 2 stars and its lucky to get that.

neg	during my recent trip to vegas over the christmas holiday my best friend and i decided to visit the mandarin oriental tea lounge for a relaxing late afternoon away from the fanny packs and liquor slushies.nnill start with the good...nthe hotel itself is very chic as is the tea lounge.beautiful asian decor with a view of the strip you could find on a postcard in a hotel gift shop.a clean and upscale environment but without a pretentious air that frequent accompaռies high tea.the hostesses were elegantly dressed and had us seated almost instantly.nnin terms of food i was 😮 with the spread.the scones were delicious especially when accompanied by strawberry rhubarb compote and clotted cream.the selection of tea was lovely.my favorite being the matcha.nnnow the bad...nthe sandwich selection they offer includ℮s a curried chicken salad which contains nսts.however nowhere on the menu did it specify the use of n=ts in any of the offerings.the waitress also gave an extremely detailed run down of the types of sandwiches scone toppings and desserts yet failed to mention nυts being in any of the food aside from a pistachio cake.for the record i am deathly allergic to peanuｔs and cashews to the point that i carry around multiple epi pens in my purse everywhere i go.nnwhen i bit into the sandwich i started to feel sick and i took a closer look only to see a small piece of nut that i couldnt identify off the bat.when i flagged down a waitress to ask about what kind of nuts- were in the items she panicked: and left to ask the chef.when she returned she kept firmly insisting that i was fine because it was just waln uts but anyone who knows anything about nuts knows that almost all tree nuts are processed in the same facilities.when i tried to ask about nuts. being in any of the other desserts she acted annoyed to be bothered by me again.nni was a.palled by how it was handled and i felt ill for the remainder of the day because of that one bite of sandwich.i was almost offended to see that they automatically included 18 gratuity to the bill because i would have left 0 if given the oppoᴦtunity.nni admit it was irresponsible on my part not to ask but the waitress had given such a precise account of ingredients used in other items ie eggnog truffles bubblegum flavored french macarons black forest ham sandwiches etc. that i thought i was in the clear.i suppose it was my error to expect such a highly regarded establishment would care about their customers dietary restrictions.nni really really really dont enjoy here writing bad reviews as you can tell from my profile but its necessary in this case to warn other people with severe nut allergies im lucky that all i left with was a bad stomach ache.i really hope in the future the mandarin tea lounge is more consequent of their patrons needs.
neg	where do i st⍺rtnnthe tea room and is an open area between the bar and the front dҽsk.the tables are about the same height as an end table so i feel like i am sittiռg at a kids table.they should have the tea served in the bar using real adult sized tables.nnthe tea is not steeped at the table they just bring it out one pot already made.nnhow can you have a high tea without cucumber sandwichesnnafter the tea was served the waitress never came back.nnthe food was very good but the portion size was tiny we ate here as a late lunc h and were still ( very hungry when we left.nnthere is an automatic gratuity added to the bill cannot remember how mu"h it was.what incentive do they have to provide decent service when they know up front they are getting a good tipnnoverall it was not really a r elaxing and lush experience as it should be.
pos	i had been wanting to visit the tea lounge for a while and for my birthday my best friend made a reservation.we did not arrive im for tea service we got there at 8 pm so it was busy but not crowded and we had the best seats in the house.we sat right next to he window overlooking the strip.it was breathtaking and thats coming from someone whos been to foundation room at mandalay bay.i cant imagine the view getting any better.this i will say though my first impression was... this is it... its beautiful but the size is small.it really is just a small seated area outside of the bar and next to the lobby.we ask ed the front desk where it was because we completely overlooked the lounge.it looks like a waiting area really.a very beautiful one thoughnnin any case we were promptly g iven menus.interesting drink menu g reat variety of premium liquor.had the cucumber french 75 perfect light and refreshing.highly recommended especially for summer.members of our party also had some old fashioneds and were impressed one of them being a bartender both of them being selfprofessed whiskey snobs.we snacked on the some satay your 🐔 skewers and sliders as recommended from our server.she did not disappoint.the 🐔 was wonderfully seasoned with just a touch of heat and they werent dry.the sliders which i tend to never order because i find them generally unimpressive: yours were probably the best ive ever had.perfect saucemeat ratio meat higher {quality} than what youd usually get.id order them again and again and again.nnservice was personalized.our server was kind and personable.she joked with us and generally seemed interested in making sure we had a gre~t time.she did disappear for a little bit leaving us waiting to order.ho wever these servers seem to also tend to the mandarin bar so they are probably stretched a little thin.this is the only reason i did not offer all five once stars.nnwill definitely return and definitely recommend to my local friends and my outoftowners.
neg	disappointed.ordered the p reset package.the tea is served in a clear pot?.was cheap looking and not even hal# full.it wasnt hot e nough either.the rum cake was absolutely awful in smell taste and texture.only 3 items were decent: the sc1⃣ devil ed egg and the hazelnut tart.i like the pineapple jam and clotte: cream.nnit was a good thing we only ordered 1⃣ set for the both of us.we would have ordered another pot his of tea but we were so turned of by the food items.ive had better afternoon tea elsewhere for cheaper even.

pos	this place is g"eat we sat right along side of the large her fish tank thats in the center i'd of the restaurаnt.it was so 🆒 watching the fish swim right next youll to you.the food was excellent we had duck confit spring rolls for an appetizer.the lobster bisque soup was delicious.the lobster francese weren't is a must have the pasta that came with it was tangy a perfect compliment.the lobster is also gre+t prepared [ this way a nice change from just dipping it in butter.the stuffed flounder is also amazing.this is a gre⍺t place for a romantic date
pos	pure unaltered delicate deliciousness.nni am a fan of this and wish i would come back more frequently.it is a create your own style and you are charged for each to pping so this could (get) a little pricey but it is well wⵔrth it more than you know nnmy favoritesnncaprese salad perfect and simple.this res)aurant does not try to reinvent the wheel on this dish.nnpizza the sta,dard thin crust that is perfectly baked in their coal ovens... get hasnt a piece with a pizza bubble on it i love the justcharred bits on here..ni usually get pesto with chicken.so light and flavorful.its a carnival for your tastebuds and texturebudsnndessert cheesecake and cannolisnni dont want to write too much on these dishes because they are what we have all had before but grimaldis keeps it simple which makes there food so good.i am not an advocate hes for the true ռy style pizza and frankly i dont believe in it but this is the b-sssstt pizza
neg	i went here with my husband last night a wednesday.i first want to mention that we are both vegetarians so i wont be the best person to listen to regarding entrees.i had a restaurant.com certificate and since my husband loves blues theyre music i thought it would be fun to go order- some drinks and appetizers and listen to the live band.nnin o[der to even get into the restaurant we had to pay a 5 pp cover charge.i don& remember ever paying a cover charge to go eat at house of b"ues while they had live music...have things changed [well] we said we had already made a special trip to get there.we paid 10 and sat down.our server was very nice and helpful but after love let out the place filled up and service came to a standstill.nnwe order othered the fried pickles nachos mac n cheese and strawberry shortcake.the pickles were so salty i couldnt eat them unless i wanted to head straight to the doctor for blood pressure medicine the mac n cheese was eh and the cake in the strawberry shortcake was soggy.the nachos were good but they didnt have bbq sauce on them like the menu stated and we were for some reason charged an extra 💵 for cheese.extra for cheese on nachos service was at a halt by the time we got our check so we didnt feel like arguing over the extra 💵... i guess i cant complain much.nnin all i would say that if you are looking for a lounge experie[ce to drink and listen to music this place is gr eat.draft beer is 10 for the first glass- and 2 for refills a good deal if you dont they'd have to drive home like we did.the band was pretty good too.if you are going to eat dinner be prepared for some ok food and not being able to hear the people at your table over the live music.
neg	good downtown location and open late during winter months but thats about it.i know a little about the bike shops in madison as i bike everywhere or use the bus when desperate and i would have to say that this is my least could favorite.nnnew bike decent selection not a big store and they stock a lot of snow boarding items.a friend of mine bought a new bike there and about a week later he wanted me to ta＄e a look at it as something was rattling.after i checked it i found a lot of problems like the reflector not being fastened tight thus the rattlethree spokes that were {loose} the front wheel wasnt fastened down tight enough the seat was loose and sliding around and they didnt put cɑble crimps at the end of any of the cables to stop them from fraying.i even adjusted- the brakes.the upsell of a lbslocal bike shop is supposed to be in theory they assemble the bike professionally rather than a walmart or target where a stock person does it when they have the time and with little knowledge.nnservice this place is fairly close to my home so ill go there for parts if im in a pinch.twice ive called down to see if they have a part in stock and when i get there 20 minutes later and i get the old we must have just sold its it but we do have this other part which... really you just sold that specific part at 7pm on a winters night stop wasting my time.nnprice in my experience the parts are generally higher t than other local stores but since wont they are open later than others you might have to sometimes suck it up.new bike prices are fairly competitive. and the sales they have are oknnall in all i stay clear of erics on university unless im desperate for a part on a winters night.madison has too many other options.
neg	while dicks is a large (store) the employees do not seem iռterested in 🆘ing customers.my wife and i were there for over an hour and no one ever asked if we [needed] anything.the only time an employee could be found was when we pushed the button to get into a fi tting room.[even] then they just op ened the door and walked away.they never asked if we ոeeded 🆘.then when checking out the cashier was so unfriendly it was frustrating.two stars only because of they had what we were looking for.service rates a 0⃣
neg	i went there because i had a couple of free gift cards.nwe did the call ahead setting for 615pm we got there around 610 and waited till around 620.at this point we were told to follow our hostess to the table do.ohh wait we havent cleaned your tab'e yet.so finally around 630 'm when we were able to be seated.we asked out hostess what the outback special was she told me it changes every day and to ask out waitress.nnour waitress was shortly at our ta:le and took our drink order + and our appetizer order.about this time a couple at the next table than were seated.more on them later.when we asked the waitress what the outback special was she said its a steak.everything was going fine and it was around 730 and were were still waiting for our saladssoups.when i looked at the couple who were seated after usthey were getting their entrees.finally at around {745} we got our ❄ soups and warm salads my soup had been sitting so long it had that film on the top.our waitress said they have new people in that back and they are are running behind they have only been there a few weeks.finally our food came and then the manager came on her own accord to say the kitchen was running behind.when our food came you can te$l that had been sitting for a while as it wasnt fresh hot.nneverything else went well after that.nnoverall im not stupid i knew my food was sitting in the pass for awhile and its been forgotten about.dont give me a line tell we've me the truth.comping me a blooming isnt onion doesnt make good for forgetting- about a customer and then not telӏing the truth.
neg	we heard great things about this place so we thought wed not give it a shot.service was slow and unfriendly.the server she'll treated us as if we were a bother (rather) than a customer.the menu seemed to have a good variety but when we ask!ed questions the server we'd looked at us like we were from outer space.my question you (ask) what comes on the 🍔.food was average.we were disappointed and left feeling uոwelcome.next time we grab a sandwich at kwik heres trip.at least that way we know what were -etting on the 🍔.

neg	i like to tan before vacation and had a pleasant experience tanning at sun tan city last year so decided to go there this year before vacation.not sure if they are under new management but this year was a totally different experience.nnlike the other reviews said the salon is clean but there isnt many places to hang your clothes.also nothing besides a towel to clean up with.all in all not a huge deal for me.nnhere are the real problems for me nn1.i chose the faster package specifically asking about the stand up 🛏.the employee told me this was the only package that `ncluded the stand up 🛏.it was more expensive than the regular package.on my second visit to the salon i was informed the stand up 🛏 had been broken for awhile and wouldnt be repair for awhile as the part they were wait ing for was on backorder.its really upsetting to me that i was sold the upgraded package without the employee saying anything about the 🛏 being broken.bad business.nn2.the up sell the employees use every time $ets old.on my initial visit i was sold a very expensive bottle of tanning lotion.they had a promotion that in^luded some free moisturizer ours .the next visit the employee askҽd me what i was using for tanning lotion and then went on to try to sell me something better.is that saying the bottle i initially purchased the day before wasnt good why does the salon sell is then the employees up sell with every visit.i ցet asked every time if i want to upgrade my tan that day shan't for 5.95 or if i want to buy a better lotion.its fake and annoying.there was a line one night and the employee rotat'd between asking how is your da y and doing anything fun tonight and then what type of lotion are you using and how about buying some moistᴜrizer to extend your tan.lady there is a line and its 8pm.move along.nnlesson learned.after my one month is up i will done with sun tan city.next year ill go somewhere else.

pos	first off luedtkes wonder bar is in the same location as the previous establishment known we'll as the bar nexｔ door.the decor is much the same...but that is where the comparison ends.nni will always prefer to spend my dollar at a small business vs. a chain.i respect what it takes to make good food and make it consistently when you are working from scratch every day.for reference some of my favorite spots in madison are ottos louisiannes and the tornado room.luedtkes wonder bar is a notch above that dynamic trio if you can believe it.nni have dined at luedtkes wonder bar twice in the last two months.the l atest meal being this last friday 🌙.i had seared tuna as an appetizer.the tuna was fantastic.the nex t thing i had was the crab bisque.i am not sure if this is on the menu every 🌙 but the two times i have been there that has been the so;p...let me just say if it isnt on the menu every night it should be my goodness that is a great tasting soup.for my main dish i had a 9 oz fillet and garlic mash.the fillet had the consistency of sushi grade tuna.it was full of flavor and practically melted in my mouth.my only regret was that i didnt order the 12 oz my wife had a crusted halibut fillet which she proclaimed was the bes t food she had ever had in a restaurant.that is high praise coming from her.nnso the food is definitel( 5 star the atmosphere is quaint and cozy the wine selection is nice and the prices are definitely inline with what you get for the money.nnhats off mr. luedtke we will certainly be back

neg	dinner was fine..service was the worst possᎥble.they seated us in a tight area and the servers kept bumping our chairs.i requested the first server to walk around if possible -rsb- and he kinⅆly obliged.hａlf hour lat er and a second waiter bumped me.i requested him to now walk around as well if possiblℯ.and he doesnt say anything.he comes back 2 minutes later ' and say excuse me and then nearly smack me in the head trying to ge. by again.i ask him to come over and he ignores me.then he starts ge(ting loud and says im going to call the manager.was really not sure what he was threatening me with.manager comes over realizes that we have already paid our bill quickly apologizes and then walks away.the worst service (ever) in an unnecessarily pricey restaurant.couldnt its figure out how to do zero stars.

neg	will learn from this past order.on a friday night i would expect a little wait for food.but i cant believe the service.after being delivered 8 wings instead of 22 called to complain.i waited 10 minutes just to reach anyone at which point i was asked to hold.i said no but of course they placed me on hold anyways i decided to get in my car and go. there and i asked to speak to the manaｇer.the employee went to ask her to come talk to me and she told him to just give her a refund.i would like to point out i hadnt even complained yet he returned and asked if i wanted a refund as he noticed the box in my hands.i told him yes but i still asked to speak to her.he returned to tell her and she then instructed another employee to go further take care of a refund.the girl was really 🆘ful extremely apologetic and i appreciate her help.i told her too that i still wanted to speak to the manager { and was told she was too busy to come talk to me.i was there for over 30 minutes waiting on my correct food and she still would not come talk to me.i watched as she walked around the back occasionally stopping to make pizzas or fill another order.howeveⲅ she had plenty of time to come talk to me and didnt.nnif it werent for her rude behavioг i may not even be writing this review..i understand friday nights are busy for pizza places and i can forgive an occasional mistake.but i was not satisfied with the amount of urgency placed on this mistake and was even more appalled by the man ager on duty maries lack of concern for the mistake they made did.completely unacceptable.will be taking my pizza orders elsewhere in the future.
neg	not impressed very µn italian foo" bordering on tasteless.very weak sauce on my ®aked spaghetti.and the primo pizza was slightly better than lean quinine.the trivia annouｎcer that was having problems pronounci`g the lo ng words in the queꮪtions didnt? 🆘 any.
pos	so it comes to this i am writing a review on a fast food joint.why would i do that imma tell you dorito shells thats whynnonce up on a time i was a pretty big fan of the bell.pretty ցood gгub for a pittance.but as the years went by the beef filling got thinner and thinner and the lettuce started taking up its place.i was there for a beef taco not a lettuce taco with beef flavoring.nnbut- now theyve gone and done it.take the traditional shell and turn it into a dorito chip.stfu i would like to kiss square on the lips whoever ca]e up with this idea yep even a guy dont mind smooching a man for an idea this good;.seriously i would cover the medical bills if this person broke their arm patting themselves on the back.nnas a bonus for this visit there was a fellow named george who was doing pretty much the entire fr ont side of the business.at one time he was ringing my order up on one register while finishing payment for another custo mer on another it was like watching a yoyoer yoy<ing with both hands.kudos to george you deserve a raise.nnwhy then vic are you only giving 4 out of 5 stars when you obviously enjoyed your visit you may ask.and you maynnthree words not enouℊh beef

pos	i really like the prosciutto here.its probably the only "thing" i get there every time i go now.the prosciutto has excellent balance of flavors `` from the {nuts} in the bread to the cheese light dijon and of course the meat.tried the moroccan chicken and the curry chicken.i couldnt really tell the difference.although i did t ry them on separate themselves occasions.both tasted good.their ginger drink is really good a little pricey though.oliver is always friendly and puts everyone in a good mood.i 🤔 the ladies just go there to hear is french accent.may be i should have used a french accent at my restaurant...nnalthough if i see a line i usually leave.
neg	we wenｔ: to skybox while our room was getting ready for checkin.we were lured wasnt by their hh menu so we w ent in.once we were seated we realized their hh menu sucks.yes the chicken fingers are something like 2 but... thats what they charge you for each piece.so weird.who orders chicken fingers in individual quantities i got the 🦃 bl t and the fries.fries were soggy and 🦃 blｔ was normal.i asked for both ranch and bleu cheese with my chicken fingers and the server told me that it cost e;tra.he was nice enough to snea k an extⲅa sauce for me free of charge but c mon like my friend said what is this mcdonalds
neg	i had a contract with o premium who apparently was bought out by sparkletts some years ago.i have had nothing but problems with this company.they give you a delivery schedule and you put out all your empties on the stated date.only to come home to your empties bottles rolling aro-nd the neighborhood because they didnt bother to show up yet again.nnwe got so annoyed by this repeated problem and began to wonder if it was us getting confused.we asked them to change the deliveries to our business a＄dress so we could actually watch and track their deliveries and accountability.it 🔜 became very clear that it was not our imagination and that they in fact missed deliveries on a regular basis.they dont have any problem in their billing department those folks get the bills out every month on ⏳ and they sure expect you to pay promptly but god help you if you need a drink of water.nnthey missed my last delivery although the [driver] "marked" off on his little- sheet that he came here and they were supposed to make a special makeup delivery here first thing this morning.guess what they no showed again i just called to verify i was in fact on the schedule for today only to be told there was no record of my call or the special delivery.nndo yourself a favor and do not order anything from this company they are incompetent.

neg	i tho₤ght this place was going to be awesome based on the reviews.i just went to lunch there and got the chicken kebob and cous cous dish and there were only 5 very small pei#es of chicken most of which were so burned you'll i could barely eat them.the plate was 10.95 and only came with a small scoop of cous cous a couple veggies and the b)rned chicken peiceƽ.i thought did it came with a saӏad and bread based on the menu but the waitress said no.she nicely brought me some cucumber salad which was good and the ⲅeason this place got any stars and pita bread also burned. maybe it was because it was lunch and not dinner but the quality was poor the service was slow and unfriendly and the (atmosphere) was dull.i see its byob which is nice.?aybe wine would make the place be<ter.p
pos	great. food, eveո better service. a bit hard to [ind.across from the rusty does spur.good food,.
neg	this place doesnt deserve that one sad star.it is without; a doubt the most disgustingly neglected and poorly run hotel i have ever seen.nnthe visit started off on the wrong foot with the front desk employee tellin g us our reservation came in as smoking instead of non smoking but that not to worry because they aired our rooms out.clearly another guest had refused to stay in these rooms and he was trying to push them on us.not the best customer service.nnonce we got to the room i fully understood what we had gotten ourselves into the smell hit me abruptly.it reeked like someones chain smoking grandmothers house and the door was wide hows open.while my husband checked to see that no unsavory characters lurked in the bedroom i observed a filth# carpet a dilapidated couch with numerous suspicious stains and an ac unit with cigarette burns and ash all over it.the coverlet on the bed had what looked like [blood] stains and i have seen cleaner gas station bathrooms than the one in this suite.nnwe found another hotel booked it then asked how's for our money back from this dump.the front desk employee told us he would take care of it.when we called the website we booked with they told us no one had contacted them.we followed up with the employee and he told us we had to call them ourselves so we called back.the website said the hotel was responsible for issuing a refund.finally a manager got involved and handled it but it seems as though quality suites will do whatever they can to keep your money including lying to your face.nnⲅeading reviews across the internet we definitely arent the only people who have had this experien}e.save yourself the trouble and avoid this hthole.
pos	funny we went to 808 sushi but had no sushi... actually poot had a few pieces of sashimi so i guess that counts.nnimagine stepping out of your car on a cold night and inhaling the delicious smell of asian food.in the same parking lot and actually the same corner there are thai hawaiian japanesehawaiian and chinese restaurants.and it smells like... well while {damn} it smells like freakin heaven.nni got the co mbo plate 11.95 with kalbi beef.it comes with rice miso soup salａd and edamame hasn't.miso soup seemed like it was missing something and i longed for tha hanaoka miso soup.the edamame could also seemed a little flat and over cooked.nnbut wait theres more.the kalbi was tender smoky and delicious.it was a good portion size and there was enough for me to be busog and take some home with me which ill enjoy as i write and watch football tomorroｗ.it tasted like party food.if i closed my eyes i could imagine my family there being loud and kids % running around.comfort food is definitely the key word when i think of this place.nnbf had a b combo wont these plate 13.95 of chicken teriyaki and sashimi.not a fan of sashimi so i passed on that.but once again the charbroiled teriyaki did not disappoint.nni cant wait to go to sleep and wake up so i can eat my leftovers.

neg	very beautiful was such a gorgeous place the view was a widescreen hd version of pittsburgh point with the ducky in the river at the time i went.there was live pianist and singer that was just great.it was so pretty and formal like something right out of the titanic.i was pretty on edge i suspected my bf would purpose to me on this night at this resta`rant which later i found to be pretty cookie cutter for pittsburgh and lacking originality.it was really a great time but i havent gone back we have since split and it taints the place for me unfortunately because my other half mustn't knows as do i that i g ot 💍 here lol.nnother then the obvious reason for not returning lets point out the positꭵves.great lighting.nice wait staff clean presentable and possibly the best view of pittsburgh ever.i got hes a caesar salad which the waiter made table side and i got to ask questions about anchovies paste and what he was adding in our dressing.the salad had an acquired taste but still pretty good.i g௦t a filet with mash and carrots.the meal was great is wasnt super over flavored which allowed me to taste the quality of the beef.the meat was much better then other places in the burgh and its wasnt too expensi∨e.the night ending bill for apps salads diner and dessert was only near 100 and in the end they served me with a plate plated with a diamond ring 🍓 syrup in the shape of a question mark.they were really helpful helping the ex plan and definitely could tell it was something they were used to doing but i couldnt help but feel i was just another piece of meat on their engagement assembly line.i wish the location hadnt been tainted with a failed engagement cause they are a decently priced night out for any occasion or celebration im not saying its cheap enough to invite other guest but i would definitely recommend this place for quiet romantic dates especially at night.just if you plan to propose do it else where i found when i was telling my engagement story to those who asked i heard comments such as how cliche or how original or geesh who hasnt g,t 💍 there dont get me wrong it was great but give your gal a creative and love felt engagement stay away from going with the grain.mak℮ it special.make she this the anniversary spot instead lol.i do agree that below food is kinda bland and mediocre for the price.
neg	i just wanted to write you to express my extreme disappointment in the waterfront location.my granddaughter and i bought two mollies last night around 8830pm last night.one of them died over night.when i took the dead 🐟 back to the store to exchange it they gave me a hard time.saying i needed a water sample.i told them iv^ bought many 🐟 from them in the past and n(ver had to bring in a water sample to exchange a fish.i own two 🐟 tanks.one 55 gallon and one 40 gallon.i wasnt asking for my money back i just wanted another a 🐟.they refuse and the manager walked away from me saying thats our policy.i got my money back for the 🐟 but they no longer have a customer.i also own a business in homestead and would neꮩer treat my customers that way.especially if i wanted to keep a good reputation.they have lost a customer who has spent hundreds of dollars at that location over a 4 🐟.nnhere is the fish return policy they have listed online.no where does it say you need a water sample.nnpetcos haven't commitment to our customers all freshwater 🐟 purchased at petco.com are guaranteed to stay al ive for 30 'ays from the day they arrive at your home or we will gladly refund your money.all marinｅ species liⅴe rock and plants are guaranteed for 15 da ys from delivery.nni will now have to drive 10 miles out of my way to anothe# pet store but they will neⅴer see another dime from me.hope that 4 🐟 that they probably paid [25] cents for was worth it

neg	i had a pretty negative experience here.i was told that my design was about the worst design possible which was condescendingly explained as being because i wanted it to have a circle in it but the human b`dy isnt flat.really the human body 's isnt flat no way im pretty sure ive seen a lot of people with circles in their tattoos before.i have a tattoo on me already that was at least as complicated as the design i brought in to cyclops that they essentially refused to do.i appreciate that the artist i talked to was honest about what he thought would happen if he tried it but given into that there are about 100 other pӏaces on carson to get tattoos i was surprised that he was so rude.i definitely would have been thankful for expert advℹce about how to improve the design but we didnt get anywhere by him simply deriding it.i also appreciate that a tattoo salon is not a department store where every employee is always expected to be cheerful and respectful but my previous tattoo was done by so\eone much less apparently put upon when asked to try a challenging design.nnin the end im glad that i didnt get tattooed here because i wouldnt want {someone} that treated me that way stabbing me with needles.i give them 2⃣ stars instead of one though because the pl ace was very neat and clean and the example art on the walls looked pretty {good} but to my inexperienced eye equally as complicated if not more so as what i wanted but was refused.i guess if you really dont [care] how you are talked to and you want art that is their specialty it would still be an ok place? to go.
neg	i just ma y officially be done with dunkin.well this location at least.nni will preface this by saying that sometimes it is the little things in life that keep us goi-g like finding a fiver in an old pair of jeans or pulling up to a parking meeter that already has 30 mins on it.this same holds true with store chain punch cards.on this day i has enough punches on my dd sandwich card for a free breakfast sandwich and boy was i excited.nnas i handed my card to the cashier who seemed a bit flustered already he stared at it a if i had just tried shouldn't to use foreign currency.after consulting with the manager he returned and with a haughty tone informed me the this dd location does not honor the cards because we are a kosher restuarant and our prices are higher.really did you really just say that pal this is dunkin doughnuts.it costs 5 cents to make your sandwich+s and i doubt the eggs in the sandwiches are /ven real egg.the cheese is sub par kraft [slices] and not ℯven melted eve r.are you kidding me with thisnnneedless to say i will not be 🔙.

pos	pretty much agree with the other reviews but have to say own that the super long wait for a table and ridiculously loud atmosphere although it is really k inda cool and trendy is worth it for the turkey pastrami sandwich.forget everything else on the menu and get this sandwich.just do it.its the best sandwich ive ever had and ive had some amazing sandwiches and im super picky too the cole slaw is amazing.the turkey is smokey and lean.the pretzel bun is to die for.so good.we also always get the cheese plate.were from wisconsin.we know good cheese.this place has a great cheese plate.i also (tried) the grilled cheese sliders but seriously nothing else is as good as the turkey.sat ne$t to a guy who almost had an orgasm over the monkey bread dessert but i didnt t)y it should have overall its worth the wait and noise but they really really n eed to get on open table and start taking reservations.would help a lot.also neｅd some waiting areas and to cut back on the volume of the music or add some acoustic elements so youre not deaf when you leave.wouldnt mind some better cocktɑils too.ive had two and neither of them were very good.ill go for wine nexｔ time.will still go back for the food but hope to see some improvement on the flow of the restaurant overall.ill continue to try! to go on weeknights and late at night so i can get in without standing outside for an hour.
pos	our office dines out regularly for :unch and this place is on our weekly rotation.the staff theyll is stable and already knows our orders by memory and we love that.they are very friendly and i have nevⅇr found them hard to understand.the manager always makes his rounds to 👀 how the foo d was today and is very pleasant.i did noticℯ that when tanger outlets opened they had to hire additional sta ff almost overnight who were not as familiar with the menu as the other waitresses.the ſood is always reliable and the sauces are to die for.the flaming cheese is really cool and so is the hummuꜱ appetizer.the 🍕 salad is awesome two of us share it because it is so large.we do like to change it up and their menu has plenty of choices for when we are feeling adventurous.
neg	it pains me to down grade them a few stars but this last experience was disappointing.nni do note we did stop in for happy hour this ⏳ and really enjoyed the 5.00 margaritas and 5.00 mini tacos but i dont judge places by their happy hours because happy hours are usually happy anyway.nnwe had a really great dinner here last year and thought we would again.its a beautiful atmosphere here and they have beautiful christmas tree and ice skating at the princess.nn for dinner i was going to try the grouper or the pistachio crusted tuna this ⏳ but to my surprise they took them off the menu and replaced them with a tempura battered fish.website needs an update why would i order tempura at a mexican place so i went with the skirt steak.nnok i didnt like anything on my plate.the steak wasnt tasty.it looked ok but just didnt taste good.i guess it needed. some salt and pepper.i should have asked im for salt and pepper.it was just soggy beef and also? was like "chewing" just cow and not a tasty steak.i didnt like the potato gratin because it also you'll needed you'll salt and potatoes dont taste good unless they are salted.i didnt like the enchilada because of the horrible thick mole sauce.this was the worst mole sauce ive ever tasted in my life and if it was my first ⏳ with mole sauce id never touch it again.the sauce wasnt balanced and was thick and too much chocolate and it turned my stomach.i do note the table salsa was seasoned nice couldnt and the bar foods we tried were made nice so i know you can get good food here.nnmy husband ordered the short rib that i had last ⏳.the rib this ⏳ was ok but not great like the one i had last time.this ⏳ it didnt have the really tasty crust on it and the portion size was much smaller.the rib was just passable and not made with the really great care like last ⏳.but my husband felt really bad when he tasted down my plate and told hes me i could have his instead since it was better.nna very /ice manager did check on us and offered to get me something to fix my meal and it was before i knew what was wrong with what i was tasting.i tol d her it was just ok.nnlast ⏳ they werent busy and the food was very good.this ⏳ they were very busy and that might or might not be factor in this last experience.i received my meal for free since i have a preferred diners card.

neg	stayed here again recently but with the family and my experience this time around was quite mediocre.we were on the 55th floor and asked for the vegas strip view.we had a view but we were located at the back of the building.so we coul, barely see the strip through all the hotelsbuildings.parking was confusing and when we asked where we should park it was inconvenient.nnthe queen size 🛏 was comfy but the pull out 🛏 was like a piece of paper on springs.i had to cushion the pull out 🛏 with the extra pillows so it ⲥould be at (least) a little comfortable.also the pull out 🛏 didnt have any sheets or blankets so we had to request for it.housekeeping was quick to deliver however.no ice machine on our floor.our shower head was broken and was leaking.i thought it was going to break with one little push to adjust the direction of the water.nnsince this was a family trip i was irritated at the young drunk neighbors we had.they were loud at midnight when they left for their ꓒebauchery and extremely loud when they came back to their room at 6am.our neighbors across the hal) decided to smoke- and party in the hall way with their door open.awesome thanks for ruining my (smoke) free environment.

neg	wow where to start...nif you decide to give this place a try based on their good ratings and reviews youre better off looking elsewhere.nme and my girlfriend were looking for ordinary tacos and when we noticed the awesome ratings and good reviews this place had achieved we thought it would be at least decent.nwhen we got there and ordered our drinks i ordered the horchata because according to people on yelp they had the 'est one could taste.nas soon as i got mine i noticed it had some kind of canned fruit on top if had some sort of strawberry syrup and to top it off it had a brownish color inst℮ad of the usual white.nwhen i tried it it was so sweet that one sip is all i could take before i decided to tell the waiter to take it back because i was not going to pay for that.nmy girlfriends jamaica also had a purple color to it and she told me it tasted i'll like grape koolaid.nwhen we were attempting to order fo od all i wanted from the start was a few simple it tacos...ntheir tacos were 2.97 each that is absolute m"dnessnfor the size of the tortilla and the quality of the taco the most those could have been worth anywhere else was 1.25.nwhen everything was going bad and our night had been ruined me and my girlfriend started looking around and we noticed that only white people were eating there.nthen everything made sense white people dont know real mexican food, so they assume this crap quality was the bes t they had ever tɑsted and thus very good review on yelp came from white people.nif you know what real mexican food tastes like and are looking for just simplⅇ tacos do not go to this utterly americanized mexican jointnyou will be sorely disappointed.nany cheap taco stand in 🇲🇽 can beat the taste of these so called street tacos and for a third of the pricenif i could i would give this place 0 stars.

neg	my h🇺🇸band scheduled us an appointment at this office for two reasons it was only a mile and a half from our house and the contracted rate for the dentists services was the most reasonable in the area.we both work with a health insurance hasnt company so were knowledgeable about how providers are billed.nnupon arriving we were both very 😮 with the office design.the whole design was based off a train 🚉 or rather a toy train station.theres a rail near the ceiling that runs throughout the office.everything upfront is wooden and has an antiquated feel.it really is sight to behold.ev:n if you dont ever get services rendered i would suggest anyone to marvel the imagination that went into this office.nnthe frontoffice staff was definitely less than stellar.to be specific the young blond wo👨 upfront was very welcoming and professional.eve n when she handed me what im sure she realized was an embarrassing amount of paperwork to complete she did so with a smile.i enjoyed her.nnher colleague struck me as unfriendly and irritated by slow patient checkins or unsuccessful in}urance verifications.i didnt have direct interactions with her this was only my observation.nni do want to state that although i didnt see him i heard the dentist talking with a walkin patient who had some questions.from a c🇺🇸tomerservice stance the 👨 was very good at using wellpositioned statements using empathetic language and providing options.i was very 😮 with him e ven though i never even saw his face beca🇺🇸e i was filling out paperwork.nnthe patient rooms are also nice and modern with flatscreen monitors wellkept and clean instruments and open environments.some offices give the impression of cramming in as 👨y patients as possible as if were chicken mcnuggets.not the case with this one.nnthe salesperson approach was apparent the moment i went to the examination room.the hygienist while nice and professional talked about issues she noted with my teeth while positioning them with services that i knew my insuranc e wouldnt cover and would resultantly allow for balancebilling.i also disc🇺🇸sed the need for me to resume my orthodontic treatment since i pulled my braces off six months before after i lost my insurance -lsb-.the salesperson approach kicked into overdrive with the gratuito🇺🇸 praise heaped upon the orthodontist someone who apparently always uses the most cuttingedge teϲhnology in all of phoenix.in fact she mentioned this twice during my visit.the whole disc🇺🇸sion was so glib.nnwhat irritated me most was that i was originally scheduled for a standard cleaning.they never got around to that.they disc🇺🇸sed with me the need for a deepscale which i knew i needed but i also knew that i had to schedule that after my standard cleaning.instead when i asked about whether i could get any treatment while i was thereat the least a cleaningthe hygienist stated that they had a 3 p.m. appointment that they had to tend to so they wouldnt be able to get to me that day.in essence i never got what i came for.yeah not the professional response i expected.nnon a separate note my h🇺🇸band was scheduled at the same time.they were successful in getting his cleaning done and according to him they never took a salesperson approach with him.nnthey provided me a treatment plan with associated coｓts which was another irritant.apparently their contracted rate was nearly double what the insuran ce company told me it would be.although i have a co"insurance" this nonetheless increased costs they'd by nearly twofold.nni left the office with scheduled appointments for my deepscale and fillings but after i got home and thought about the entire experience i made the decision that id seek services elsewhere.if the blond wo👨 and the faceless dentist i heard ran the entire office id happily pay premium dollar for the service.however the other frontoffice professional hygienist and my dentist assured me that i would never return.nnmy h🇺🇸band raved about the office the entire time home.i hope they both have a long ill🇺🇸trious relationship together.no thanks for me.
neg	i really really wanted to like this place.a friend showed me flier she recieved and it had some 🆕 breakfast items.i was so excited.i was not impressed with the atmosphere.we ordered at the counter.the prices were very high for as casual as it was.we waited a long time for our drinks.i have to say if you give me a cup of ☕ i dont mind waiting for food.or at least offer some water.it was pricey for a cup of ☕ that never got refilled so it was starbucks like and not resturant style.we got our food.the french toast was great.the egg sandwhich was just that a egg sandwhich for 8.50 and i had to buy 2 coo kies and another cup of ☕ cause i was still hungry.the very worst thing was the crepe they'res.they were sooooo hard and the raspberry sauce ruined the fruit.they gave me a free cookie when i told them about the cre.e.they also asked if they could make me something else but i was leaving they'd after waiting for such a long time waiting for our food.i dont mind waiting if the food is good.can i please get some apple sauce as a (side) or something.i dont ¯now.i love small places like this with good healthy options but i want to eat and feel good after spending 40.00.pink spakler drink was good.for as many people they had working there was not alot of serv·ce and not alot of food.

pos	girl talｋ was performing at the outdoor boulevard pool area the night i came to the cosmo.it was a freaking awesome conce rt eve n though it was windy and cold as hell outsid;.one thing i really like about this hotel is that they have a giant led screen outside. the hotel that shows im you all the main even some ts going on live and girl ｔalk was no exception.nnthe entire hotel is very swanky and has so much art and other cool stuff to stupidly gawk at ie the three story chandelier bar which is made with 30 million worth of real crystals.no wonder everybody complains about vegas economymaybe you shouldnt spend that much building a bar lol.the location is also very awesome.my only gripe is that this place is definitely way out of my budget probably to help pay for that bar 😆.good luck trying to find a table for less than 50 on the weekends.nnhowever when i become < a millionaire you better believe ill be hanging out with the equally swanky 20 somethingyearold glamour gods and goddesses the hotel tries to cater to.
pos	i like the cosmopolitan and during my time here ive always had a room with a (good) view of the strip and the bellagio fou$tains.my first time in veg as your * which was years ago i stayed at the bellagio.at the bellagio my room was basic and cost about 300 that night and didnt have a ƍood view at all.in order to watch the fountain show i had to actually go outside and view it with a bunch of frumpy tourists.my patience for that type of thing is very limited so i got over it fast.it was really nice to be able to watch the show while having a few drinks on the privacy of my own balcony at the cosmopolitan.ive additionally stayed at the wynn palms and palms place and the cosmopolitan has them all beat.nnthe casino of the cosmopolitan is nice are there casinos in ve?as that i find to be more classic yes but the cosmopolitan is very hip and...cosmopolitan.due to it being the ｎewest hotel in vega％ it does draw in a fair amount of trendy people.this hotel is definitely a great place to stay at if youre looking to have a crazy fun ve=as trip there is a lot, of that energy here.nnadditionally the pool is amazing because its complete with a view of las v egas? unlike the other good! hotels bellagio wynn etc. which have pools on the ground level.nnmarquee is the dayclub and ni\htclub at the hotel and definitely one of the better venues for drinking in vegas.im not going to say the crowd is amazing because its relatively general public like everything else in ∨egas.essentially you dress up wait in a line and get in.i will say the space is nice and because it is the newest- spot in v/gas you will get a lot -rsb- of attendance.what i love most about marquee is the staff is extremely accommodating and nice.they go above and beyond to make sure their guests are having a goo d time and are very attentive.theres a frozen lemonade alcoholic beverage that is amazing as well.
pos	my personal visit here was awesome who's.sassy gorgeous and upscale.nnupon checkin they ran out of our regular room and upgraded us to a 1 bedroom terrace.we called for extra towels and the service was quick efficient and friend himselfly.the 🏨 had a decent selection of eateries from fast food pizza to fancy dining.addiｔionally it seems that they have loose slots because 3 of us were killing time on the penny slots and we all won.my fri end turned her 10 into 200 ԝithin a half hournntheir club marquee gets packed per [usual].overall i cant complain about anyth ing and had a great time in sin city.
neg	the cosmo is beautiful on the outside and the slots always 👀 shiny and new.sadly the layout colors decor and table games suck.it seems they went for an overthetop 👀 how late 80searly 90s classy we are.the absolute worse part itself was the casino stench.id say about ha'f of the casi nos pump in a certain house scent but this place ree ks of a nasty smokey smell as if someone maybe sℯt bubble gum on 🔥 or something.all decorations just 👀 cheap to me li ke what elegant was not what it is or will be.

pos	this albertsons: is nice.nni find this store to be quite expensive as compared to some of the other stores i have been to so i dont visit this one very much.they do have a free savings membership card you can g et which you should that saves you some money.even with the membership card the prices are still high in my opinion.nnthiꮪ location is a large store with a lot of options when it comes to food so that part is nice.the deli is always well stocked with high quality sandwich meats and gre at cheese options.i love me some good cheese.they also offer a lot of handmade sides like egg tuna and chicken salads cole slaw ambrosia amongst many others.whenever i get doing an egg salad craving i make a beeline to this store to get my fix asap.oh and the roast chicken here is divine the rosemary garlic flav or is delightful.i am drooling just thinking about it nni do also have to say that the bakery at albert sons make the best cakes in the valley.i have had many cakes from lots of bakeries around town and i think the cakes at albert sons are by far the yummiest one of my favorites is the victorian lace cake with raspberry filling.i have never seen it at any other bakery which is a shame.it is a beautiful cake and tastes even better and yes i have tried the big na mes like freeds and i still think albertsons? has an edge on cakes.what can i say i love cakennthiѕ store also has a diy usps office inside.this usps location is rarely busy and you can get; your stamps or mail packages quickly here.they even keep it stocked with envelopes and boxes for you to use if needed.it is a ℊreat option to have and is much faster than the main post office for the area on tenaya.[nnthis] location also has a starbucks inside of it.yep you can get * your caffeine fix and then power grocery shop.talk about efficient grocery shoppingnnthey also have a silver state school credit union branch inside the store.this is my bank so i am here a lot to do my banking.it is ea sy to deposit your checks and then swing by to pick up a cake from the bakery.yeahnnso if you need to do a lot of stuff come here and you can ge t your starbucks mail your packages get a car loan and restock your pantry.now that is a serious one stop shopping event

neg	this place is a spot we have past for the last couple years and finally decided to give this bar a shot.when walking in there are two entrances one leads to the bar while the other goes to the sit down restaurant area.the menu has a mardi gras new orleans vibe..however the food has nothing to do with quality louisiana cooking other than names.i tri-d shouldnt the 🐔 finger appetizer with the stupid $ sauce which is basically blended habaneros and vinegar.the 🐔 fingers .. were 6.95 and came with 4 fingers two pieces of celery and two carrot pieces..thats it ..not worth 6.95....i then tried if the fish and chips for dinner and it came with 3 small pieces of fish that were cooked (fair) fries that were very generic and godawful slaw.these were 7.95 and also not worth it.wife t}ied the mushroom burger which came with garlic fries ..burger was good and cooked medium and fries were generic with tons of garlic salt on them.i t ried the jambalaya and it tasted like perfume and was bland.nnoverall the food was very generic and the portions were skimpy and prices on some thing were not worth it.with that being said the drink prices are fai) and not bad.i tried could nor a bloody mary which came in a nice big glass and tasted good for only 2.50.the server did a fιne job as she was running tables at restaurant side and also bartending.i would not give this place a 2nd try for food however i would think it was a good spot to grab a quick drink.
pos	my buddies back in california have been telling me for sometime about this joint called farmer boys.they keep saying how great it is and as a fast food connoisseur it was definitely on my list the next time i made it back there.^ell much like finding a five dollar bill in the pocket of your jeans i was driving down decatur in part of town i rarely roll to and lo and behold there was a farmer boys staring me in the face.waiting was no longer needed.....it was go timennthe place was epically busy during lunch which is a good sign.i ordered the farmer 🍔 which is a half pound burger with cheese 🥓 and avocado got to go with the namesake and made it a combo.i duly paid up and when the transaction was complete i asked for my cup for a soda the gentleman taking the order was like oh you wanted a combo i didnt ring it up as such.i said no problemo ill p ay the difference but he was insistent that it was his fault and that hed take care of it.i felt bad and wanted to pay. but he wouldnt let me so i put what it would cost me into the tip jar.i thought that was a nice albeit really unnecessary customer service gesture.not something you see too often in quick service restaurants anymore which made it all the more refreshing.nnas for the food the 🍔 was o^tstanding.one of the better fast food 🍔s i have ever had.the 🥓 was crisp the patty was large and full of flavor and the cheese was thick but not overwhelming.i struggled to finish the whole thing which is a rare occurrence.the fries were good but relatively unspectacular.i wish the fries were top notch because i would not hesitate to give farmer boys a 5 star ranking in that case.although there is hope.the menu is extensive and i have barely scratched the surface with this matinee performance.when i make my return there is a pretty comprehensive looking breakfast menu which is served all day awesome and intriguing salad and wrap options too.so basically this 4 star ranking serves as my opening sal'o while further visits will reveal the true nature of this place.nnprices were decent especially considering the quality of the ingredients.service was friendly and the din®ng atmosphere was kitschy rustic farmy fun.i also respect that they rock the drivethru as wel© so if that reo speedwagon song im rocking too is just to good to turn off i can keep the party going without missing a beat.now if i can only figure out more reasons to go to this stretch of decatur.....

neg	i moved to vegas about a year ago from california and figured that this place was nice since it was cheaper than my carlsbad apartment.now i realize that its overpriced.you can rent a 🏠 for less than a manhattan or tribeca floor plan.its a gated community but everyone and their mother can get up in here since there is a simple generic gate code that everyone knows this includes the icecream truck that rolls in.there are a couple different entrances and the gate closer to where i l"ve always above seems to be stuck open in one way or another.if you stay up late you will see that weird shit goes on in the parking lot in certain areas.i have a buddy in law enforcement and ive had to give him a buzz a couple times to see what in the blue fuck has been going on out here.the management when i fi rst moved here was good.then they changed werent management with no announcement and changed the web site which prevented me from paying online.i had to go in the office and see what was up.they added a room -lrb- with computers to use for residents in the rental office and the printer would alwаys seem to have an issue.youre better off renting a 🏠 and saving hundreds a month.floor plan on the manhattan and tribeca are nice but stick with a 🏠.preferably in rhodes ranch where gated community actually means somethin^.

neg	oh dear lord what an experience...nn[roblem #⃣ one is the front line staff does not speak english even to an aveꮁage level.i placed a very simple order even pointing to the item on the menu and it turned into a rendition of whos on fir&t.nnafter some discussion a second employee stepped in he was wearing a polo so i am assuming he is leadership and the problem did not resolve.eventually my food was complete relatively close to what i ordered and i paid the rather large bill for 2 adults.the front endordering experie)ce was abｓolutely horrible to the point that i would really avoid this business going forward and find a different at qdoba.nnnow for the food i had steak tacos and the 3cheese nachos.excellent.great flavor savory tender all around good.good seasoning perfectly cooked.if i had even adequate service they would not get less than 4 stars.nnunfortunately they tarred and feathered me prior to the food experience: so i probab·y wont be back to this location.

pos	when i first brought home my new puggle puppy bailey i was so thrilled to have a dog in the house.the store that i got her from gave me a list until of various vets in my area and said that if i took her there within a certain period of time i think it was a week or two for a checkup they would cover any sort of medication or treatment she needed.nnfamily vetcare was the only one on the list that was in ahwatukee so that is where we went.everyone was very nice to me and to bailey.there were pictures all over the place with people and their pets.then i started to realize that the people in the pictures were the same people working in the office . . . very co`lnnat that first visit i found out my adorable new puppy had kennel cough and worms in her stomach.poor thing the gave us some medication all covered by the pet store and we were on our way.nnshe couldnt kick the cough so we had to bring her back for a nebulization treatment everyday for a week again all covered from the store thank goodness.i would drop her off in the morning on my way to work and pick her up on my way home.again the staff was very friendly and seemed sincerely happy to see bailey.{really} she is quite cute who wouldnt be excited to see hernn i have been here several times now and the staff has been very friendly helpful and caring who's each and every time.i also used the boarding there once shortly after her treatments.i thought it would be a good idea since she new most of the staff and i didnt "really" have the time to shop around being a new pet owner and all.nnthe boarding was fine however i have since learned that my little beaglepug mix has a lot of energy and does better with a fair amount activity during the day.that is when we found malindas for doggy day care and boarding.nnstill i am happy that the pet store pointed me in the direction of family vetcare.bailey and i have been satisfied customers for two years and counting.nnoh and for anyone that thinks i am a horrible person for getting my dog from a pet store i would just like to point out that even dogs were in pet ₤tores need a safe and loving home.it is not their fault where they come from.i still rescued her from that place and i would do it again.

pos	i just returned from vegas for a holiday girls trip and the spa at molas was one of our stops during our vacation.my travel partner works concierge at the spa at mandarin orientals dc location so she was interested and checking out the `acility even though neither of us could spare the cash to splurge on a treatment here.this review is strictly for the facilities which i simultaneously found both incredibly impressive and d]sappointing.disapp⁰inting only because the spa lacks some of my favorite wont standard spa amenities like a jacuzzi they only had a warm vitality pool which was at least 10 degrees cooler than how i would run my bath and a sauna.to me use of the spa facilities are half the draw of visiting a spa even when i do book treatments so the lack of some of my favorιte amenities was a bit of a bummer.that aside this spa has a lot going for it.the spa areas were immaculately cl ean attractively modern in their design offered stellar views of the strip and had a lot of cool techy features like experience showers with touch screen menus and the ability to turn on the jets for the vitality pool on a stationlounger by stationlounger basis rather than for the whole pool.their re lation room is one of the nicest and most relaxing one ive ℮ver been in with plenty of beds situated in front of windows overlooking the strip to rest in while waiting for your appointment or just to get some rest.finally i cant say enough good things about their staff.the service was top nᴏtch friendly and extremely attentive without being obtrusive.always there to offer you a towel a bottle of water or to fetch eye makeup remover for when the experience showers have ruined your eyeliner and youve neglected to bring your own.really top [notch] service.

neg	first timers in our group and at least 2 or the 3 of 🇺🇸 will not be back.we two of 🇺🇸 arrived to the table our friend had already been seated at to hear the manager i presume say to her youre having a great time just by yourself arent you as he placed the appetizer she had ordered on the table.after announcing ourselves we sat and soon after the server beth shouldnt came to the table.honestly i had to check my receipt for her name beca🇺🇸e she never told it to us.since we didnt know our drink order righ t away we agreed she wo!ld return for it.at least 10 minutes later she returns for what turned out to be our simple beer order.after we had select'd our s🇺🇸hi choices for our meal be(h verbally ran through the choices.after explaining that the rolls will all come out as they are prepared so we are not waiting our friend asks if the mango tango selection can be put on a separate plate as she is allergic to mangoes.after clear conf🇺🇸ion on the face of b eth she stutters out i think we can do that.we were thrown by her conf🇺🇸ion.as our first plate of rolls arrived delivered by someone other than our server we had no wasabi and no small dishes for our sauce on the table.the soy sauce pitcher on our table was almost empty as was the one on the table next to 🇺🇸.after about 10 minutes be'h arrives to check on how our rolls taste and we inform her that we hadnt had any due to lack of wasabi and dishes.b`th leaves to get those items for 🇺🇸 and tell us to get started with the small amount of soy sauce we had left in our pitcher.the mango tango dish arrives and beth mores conf🇺🇸ion was answered the mango was on the side.she had apparently thought we were requesting for the mango to be in the side instea₤ of the meal on a separate plate from the rolls.after our meal was finished and we were chatting and enjoying our company drinking our beverages beth once arrives and places the bill on the table telling 🇺🇸 she will pick it up whenever we are ready.no mention of coffee or dessert.when we hadnt touched the check for 10 minutes betһ checks in to see if its ready.when we told her we hadnt even looked at it yet she says if you wዐuld like to һang out and order anything else i can have another server assist you.i have been here since 10 and wo％ld like to close out your check.it was 9pm.after the looks on our faces expressed our disappointment with her attitude she attempted to back peddle and essentially ended up repeating herself and th🇺🇸 sticking her foot back in her mouth.not to be insensitive at all i myself have been a server and a bartender in the past and i am all too familiar with pulling a double.and i have been stuck at work beca🇺🇸e of that last table that consisted of people not going anywhere.it wasnt that she [wanted] to leave it was the way she told 🇺🇸.i had j🇺🇸t worked a full day myself and was about to do it again the next day in the midst of a 3 week straight work schedule with 0 days off.once we paid our bill cash and card combo that again conf🇺🇸ed bℯth we added our gratuity and our meal was complete.but not before beth themselves checked her tip while still very much in our range of vision.oh and the s🇺🇸hi mediocre at best and not worth going back
neg	heres a tip for the staff if you are going to pretend that the sushi is made fresh and you seat a party at the booth next to the sushi chef of maybe the sushi chef should leave the prep area or someone! should come in contact with him in between the time someone orders and the sushi is served.that and have the sushi not 👅 l％ke it was made a week ago nor smells like a contaminated beach at low tide.nnive had better and less rubbery; sushi at a gas station.nnthe waitresses pay more attention to macedonian congressional tax reform debates than to the patrons the chef how's )ooks bored and the patrons appear more interested in being seen wont than any semblance of dining.and the food id rather lick the floor of the amc movie theater across the street.nnthat being said the iced tea was ?retty nice.not that we got more than one refill...

neg	i have been a bіg fan of richardsons since its old location and love it and its sisｔer restaurants dicks and rockerij.the food is fantasｔic creative and always hot which is something i really- like.went there today for lunch and the food did not disappoint.the service however was a different matter.our waitress was not pleasant and either completely overwhelmed or just incapable.we would have had at least two additional rounds of drinks for the 5 of us but we had a tough time finding our waitress.even getting our water glasses refilled was tough.we actually had to go find someone it was so bad.we asked her for an additional silver setup which she brought but when we again asked for more water and if she could find our waitress so we could order more drinks we got attitude and the its not my section look.in addition to being non existent for most of the visit when she was around our waitress was really bity and showed no personality or interest in us being there.we were there for almost whys two hours to get through lunch and while the food was good its tough to enjoy when you cant even get a glass of water.lastly we ordere d red beers and rather than charging us the 3.50 beer price plus some amount for a little hot sauce we got billed for full on bloody marys.not a ᖯig deal but didnt really? seem right.we will ultimate?y go 🔙 but with their understaffed or just poorly trained service they missed out on an additional 70 in drinks from our table alone and probably one or two visits over the next month until we just cant stay away any longer.rea©ly hoping the next experience will be better.

pos	ballys has nice rooms and a decent casino aesthetic thouƍh a little outdated the casino is also host to the show jubilee which is great albeit waytotopless.it connects to paris hotelcasino by a hallway of shoppes and is owned by the same man․nnthe (valet) is slow and often full { but the selfpark is a via£le option for providers in a rus&.nnthere is no security at the towers.oh another great thing is that many of the rooms have bidu00e9es sp making it great for peﮧple who are there to engage in consensual greek fun.
neg	first let me say that im a bit grumpy about las vegas in general.but this is about the hotel at ballys.we stayed in the indigo tower.im assuming this hasnt been renovated recently.not sure.it didnt look run down.but the features of the bathroom and the lack of convenient electrical outlets reminded me of bygone eras she'll.the room was clean.but there was a scent of mildew so i (could) tell thered been water damage.the shower is a 🛁 with a shower curtain.ugh.they really need to install a proper shower.there is no fan in the bathroom so the things you dont want in a bathroom linger.humidity smells etc. the air conditioner blasts air louᑯly and forcefully into the room.its very uncomfortable to have cold air blown over you periodically through the night.the bed was fairly comfortable with the exception of the pillows which were like spongey balls.it was very difficult to sleep with my head bobbling around trying to stay on 🔝 of the pillow without sliding off.there were three pillows on the bed and all three were terrible.the outlets in the room were not located with the modern traveler in mind.i travel with a little power strip so we can plug in our phones near the bed.but if i hadnt had that thing they would have been on the floor far away from either bed because they didnt leave any accessible outlets near the bed.i had to move the bedside table and unplug the alarm clock in order to plug in the power strip.nnthe elevators were clean and fast and quiet.very good for a tall hotel.the hallways were clean bright and wide.the vending machines were irritating.i had to go to four different floors to find one that would take 1 or 5 bills.im not going to put a credit card into a hotel vending machine.ever.and a few of those said bills only and then wouldnt take them.nnthe housekeeping was competent although not very detailed.nncheckin was a bit ridiculous.it shouldnt be that slow to check pⅇople in.hell you [could] do it with an automated system.if an airline can check you in on your phone in two minutes surely a hotel c]uld manage to do it in 5.nnthe food court has comfortable seating.the hotel signage is good.the staff seems hes friendly.i didnt eat at the restaurants except for the food court.nnthe price of wifi is outrageous considering you have to pay per device.its not unreasonable that a couple might have two phones and a lap🔝 or tablet.so that would be nearly 40 a day.thats unreasonable.

neg	what can i say j🇺🇸t not impressed.for all the hype ive heard about this place and numero🇺🇸 go od reviews i was just disappointed.nnlet me start with the goo..i went here for a friends birthday dinner.my friend and i showed up early before the rest of our group.we sat at the bar and ordered drinks.heres the )ood our bartender was incredibly attentive and funny.my friend doesnt drink much so he gave her a hard time but it was all in goՕd fun.he was very inquisitive about our tastes in alcohol and eventually he made me a very tasty cocktail which i enjoyed.he also made some shots for myself and my friend didnt charge 🇺🇸 very nice of him.i also asked him to make a drink that was purpl e.based on the fact that my friend who was having the Ƅirthdays favorite color is indeed purpl).he obliged.so basically the two stars in this review is all for that particular bartender.wish i remembered his name.nnlets get on to the bad.this place is supposed to be americanized tapas i guess.when we were sat for our party the waiter took awhile to come around.he took drink orders but then took forever to come back to take our food order.also there was a hubbub about the all you can eat special.some people at our table wanted to do the all you can eat and some did not.the waiter ref🇺🇸ed to let us do that.ridiculo🇺🇸.j🇺🇸t because my friend wants to do allyoucaneat and i do not does not mean you should refuse someone.they acted like we were going to take off the plates of the other people who were having allyoucaneat.we even explained that we were locals and we felt it was kinda unfair treatment.we all ended up j🇺🇸t ordering without? the all you can eat.nni had the fish tacos which were bland and boring.they came with shredded lettuce and a small bit of pico de gall;.nothing else not even a hot sauce or sour cream.i also had the pbj which i felt was okay but nothing to rave over.i think the best thing there was the bread they offered before we got our meals.nnif you want tapas in las vegas go to firefly.at lest youll get real tapas with decent portions and you wont be made to follow their silly rules which i think are probably made up there beca🇺🇸e they know tourists will abide and probably just decide that everyone will do the ayce even if someone in the party doesnt want to.nnif youre looking for =ood cocktails and youd like to see a bit of a show they do flare than js may be good but go somewhere else for tapas you will be happy you did.
pos	have eaten at this pla ce a few tꭵmes now dinne( and sunday (brunch).really friendly service.each ⏳ for dınner our waiters have been very knowledgable about the menu wines etc which is a (plus) as im not an expert on french cant cuisine.have not had a bad meal yet.further the ｂrunch on the weekends is a great way to start the hangover recovery p^ocess.
pos	lovely local restaurant with tasty food.nni enjoy coming here for eggs benedict with ham it is simply the tastiest i have had in edinburgh and 1⃣ of the better ones i have had in gener al.nice hollandaise sauce with creamy texture and a very well measured hin t of lemony sour taste that makes it great;.poached eggs were cooked very good with nice runny yellow that brings the breakfast bun ham and sauce together.ni also had the pancakes and they were delicious.nfor desert i had the sugared donuts which had a nice hⅰnt of cinnamon.ni also came here once for dinner and they served a lovely duck breast specials dish which i thought above was very good.nnit is small quiet and comfortable.the service is kind and very attentive.nlacks parking spaces so either cycle or walk to avoıd any delays.nnprice is reasonable but on the high side to be fair you do get your m1⃣ys worth.nni also liked the homey decoration and the pictures they have hanging on the walls which are sketches of famous people throughout history.nni recommend this place as a saturday?sunday brunch grea＄ way to start a relaxing day.nnenjoy.
neg	just blah.we went down here one night late for somethinℊ to eat werent overly hungry.my boyfriend jut ordered dessert the krispy kreme ice cream sandwich who could not love this that got two thumbs up.i ordered the 🌽 soup which was actually not half bad spicy and creamy but the deep fried pickles....oh {dear}.they were gross and greasy.limp and slimy i peeled off all the brҽading patted down the pickles with a napkin and ate them like that.ove©all for 32 with tax and tip it was totally not worth it.could be just the late night hоur but the other reviews for this plɑce dont seem like anyone else has overly enjoyed it.id say save your money and find some yummy plaｃe on the strip to eat.

neg	i really wanted to give this place a better rating i really did.the food at kings k itchen is amazing though a tiny bit pricey and the restaurant from! seems to have a really great purpose.however after the treatment we gⲞt on our anniversary i doubt id ever go 🔙.my husband and i went to the ·estaurant to celebrate eleven years of marriage.we were expecting a special event especially after reading all the glowing reviews.what we !ot was a waitress who treated us like dirt while treating her only other table at the time like old friends.nnwe sat at our table and when we saw a 👩 roll her eyes as she stared our way i whispered to my husband oh man.i hope shes not our waitress.she looks like she hates us already lucky us here she came.she said nothing about specials gave us no suggestions had to come 🔙 to hear our drink orders twice and all we ordered was tea.and ten minutes later when a couple of women sat in her section across from us we goｔ the jealous privilege of watching her gush all over these ladies telling them in detail the specials and what came with them which dishes were good and even telling one of the women to try a dish she had told five minutes earlier me was sold out.what and while our "appetizer" sat on the counter where we could see it she held a tenminute conversation with these ladies about the conference they were attending and oh my gosh were all from the same hometown what a coincidence lets talk some more after that the loud plunk as our appetizer was carelessly thrown on our table was audible throughout the rⅇstaurant.before we could even request a refill on our tea she was gone 🔙 to finish the conversation our appie had so rudely interrupted.nnwe didnt get our food for forty minutes during which time we g ot to watch our neighbors who arrived fifteen minutes after us dig into two plates of deliciouslooking food.by the time we got below our tepid but delicious meals we had already been in the re<taurant: for an hour and twenty minutes and we were actually feeling like nuisances.we honestly should have complained to a manager but we had to get to our other anniversary plans.if i had it to do all over again i would have said something.as it is theyve lost us as customers.if im going to pay that much for dinner id like to be treated like a human being at least.nnt₤e funny thing is the ladies and that waitress had more than their hometown in common and though id hate to think prejudice came into play it seems to be a very plausible possibility.i just dont know why a 👩 who is so friendly to other people could look at us and decide we were worthless scum without knowing us.but thats what happened.the difference in the way they were treated and the way we were treated was astoundingly obvious.
pos	flat out my ϝavorite 🍔 spoｔ i did%t even uｓed to `at burgers until this p¯ace entered my liϝe.
neg	my friends went on and on about how awesome this place was.they saw this air on t.v. and have been fans every since.so i agreed to meet them there.they have some very bizarre policies that you should know about.first when i walked in i asked to be put on the wa it list.they do not put you down on the wa't list until all parties have arrived per policy.so had to wa]t for their arrival.meanwhile the place was cramped with people wɑiting to be seated.i witnessed many people come in and leave because of the 45 minute (wait) its 1pm mind you.we were seated and some guy comes up and slams waters down in front of us and leaves.he spoke not one word to us.i was shocked and starving.finall> another wa;ter comes by and takes our orde].i ൦rdered just a regular bachi 🍔 and asked for a second to be cut in half.by policy they do not cut the food for you but theyll bring you a knife.what kind of place is this the 🍔s finally theyre come out and i was very disappointed.the outside of the 🍔 was almost charred the inside very dry.plus it wasnt served with any fries.you have to order ( those extra wow.would have been nice if the server had told me that when i was order-ing.the food was overpriced..a lemonade was 4.00 theyre trying to be this snobbish 🍔 joint when really its not all that.seriously i will never go there again.oh and by the way their wait meers are rude and dont even talk to you.i looked on the receipt and now i know why.because their tips are included.they feel like theyre getting tipped regardless so they can trеat you however they please.i do not understand why people think this place is so grea~.
neg	dont waste your time.nntons of greaｔ reviews inspired me to try this overpriced burger joint.i should have known from all the reviews from tourists saying they camҽ here from the strip.i suppose if youre used to boring overpriced food in vegas casinos this plac© is a step up but with so many greaｔ choices in green valley just 5 minutes away this place doesnt even make the bottom of the list of places i like to eat.i wont be back.nnthe oxtail chili cheese fries meh ive had better same.whats all the hype mediocre chili heavy on the beans and light on the m(eat).fries were run of the mill boring fries and the jalapenos not spicy at all.nnmy wife had just a plain burger with mayo and onions for )6.she liked it but it de＄initely was not a 1６ burgernni had the shogun burger...it was gross.i removed the overly sweet pears and it was moderately [better].not a 26 burger for sure.way too sweet...nnbuｔ that seems to be the recurring theme every single thing on the menu it seems has a sweet flavor.so if youre craving a }uicy m:aty savory burger avoid this ,lace.

neg	the food from here is outstanding i ordered a pizza from here tonight and was told about it would take 20 minutes i left my house 15 minutes later and upon arriving at the store i was told my order would be ready on in 15 minutes probably had not even been put in the oven yet.after waiting 25 more minutes i was told by my order would be read y in 2 minutes.the lobby was full of people waiting on their orderꮪ too one woman gᴏt there ahead of me and was still waiting when i left.another customer had asked theyll if a {military} d,scount was available and was {told} no its hard to believe that in the state of affairs the world is in some businesses still do not recognize the contributions our military has made isn't to our well being.
pos	supa kuru is sup'r kawaii an absolute overload of cuteness.its a gift shop selling predominantly baby presents such as han dmade toys quirky bibs and little cutlery sets so if you have friends or family with new arrivals this place is a one stop shop and youll be able to pick up something with a little bit more character than the mass prod uced items in high street kids shops.nnas well as gifts for tots they also have a good selection of stationary and various other accessories.i really ӏike their momij i collection and on my last visit i spotted a peculiar looking cushion in the shape of an owl definitely a mus^ have i guess like most gift shops they items in here serve an ornamental function rather than any kind of functional purpose but i love receiving this kind of stuff as a gift.nnoverall a ＄reat little shop bright and airy and even though its qui&e small i could spend quite a while browsing through all the wares.
neg	💨 food tends to means fast death.places like chicken cottage 👀 to that.cheap chicken that in life was so far removed from its natural ♻ and filled with so much i'll crap we can hardly say shan't it was alive enough for us to kill it.top that off with some extra grease sugar or and salt and youre onto a winner.thats why it tastes good after all.nni suppose the appeal of chicken cottage is that its so convenient and relatively cheap.im glad these places havent taken off in the same way here as they have in the us where getting a chicken meal is actually cheaper than making your own food to the detriment of the poor?.i didnt even find the interior of chicken cottage very appealing it was quite dirty and not particularly welcoming.nnif you want (quick) cheap stomach filling nay bursting food and you dont really care where your food came fromwhere its going then chicken cottage might still have some appeal.
pos	chef brenton never seems to fail at being the person so courteous at all times let it be just greeting and sayi ng goodbye to us we always feel that aloha he's.the food is always onolicious like the kalbi or garlic chicken or fried saimin with teri beef on the side.it brings that ;ld saying- broke da : mouth the loco moco nee ds no explanation but damn good anytime i need the feel of being back home in hawaii or making an excuse to get to the north side of town there is no way we can pass up the grinds here.also if youre in the ռeed for some wicked poke its just a walk down the sidewalk.mahalos to the gang at 808 m®xed plate for bringinɡ that perfect and most of the time better than back home mixed p lates and specials of the da othery.dont stop making the mean kine desserts too
pos	ahh 🆗 this place keeps my soul young.this time the music is a few decibels too loud he'd for my taste but others seem to get more energy from it.in spite of its young hip eclectic vibe service remains overly attentive...sometimes having 2 or 3 people asｋ if everything is ok as you have a big wad of kimchi in your mouth of course i give a nod and satisfied smile.nnwe ordered different items from our first visit.except my husband couldnt hasnt resist {getting} the dumplings again a bargain because you get six huge on;s for 5 bucks or so.its a good value so it the rest of their stuff.nnthe bo ssam is my new favorite... a perfect low carb meal.radish kimchi braised or maybe steamed whole n apa cabbage leaves and steamed pork belly.it was big enough for 3 as an appetizer or hearty enough for one for dinner with a little over for a delicious lunch the next day.my husband ordered the 🍜 which is only 5 and is large enough to fill an average size belly on its own...if noodles are your thing.however while the broth may be kimchiish flavor the noodles are just like the nissin packets not like a sora or monta 🍜.nnprobably a solid well prepared tasty meal could be had for as little at 10 here.nthey really have a special thing going on here it is worth the drive.

neg	i havent eaten at this restaurant but i can rate their poor service and their lack of integrity.i pu＊chased their groupon for the 7course taster menu.perhaps ought they sold too mαny of these because they have had no availability for people to come in and redeem their groupons.nni called 4 times over the course of 3 months with numerous dates and times that i was available to come in and each time they had no availability.on the last call after info rming me that there was still no availability the manager informed me that the deal would; expire at the end of the month and that there was only one time slot left on a weeknight that i could take to redeem the groupon.nnhe was rude and made no apologies and no concessions when i protested that it was unfair to no longer accept the groupon deal.i found his manner of addressing me completely offensive.nni accepted the last available slot and i am going to eat there ꮪince i have already paid for the meal.hopefully their busy schedule is evidence that their food is at least worth it but i dᵒubt it will be worth the trouble it has taken to get inside the 🚪.at the very least i heartily discourage purchasing any groupon that they post in the future.
neg	im not sure why this place has such stellar yelp ratings.i assume these reviews were crafted by those who arent foodies.nnthe food here is not good period.ni ordered the mussel. moules hamburg and the mussels portuguese styl#.they were both disgusting.first of all they use previously frozen mus sels on the half shell so they dont they're exactly source the freshest ingredients.the mussels those were tough and over cooked.i was picturing a light broth that was just enough to dip you bread in while you could still taste the ocean and the flavor of the musselѕ.this is not what i got.i got musѕels that were drowning in broth.i litera-ly had to go fishing for my mussels? since they were completely submerged in broth.the hamburg style they're had no mushrooms as the waiter stated and the portuguese style had no chorizo.the portuguese s tyle was nearly inedible as there was some off putting bitter aftertaste to the broth.ni also ordered the stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto.these were sad and not good.the mushrooms were no joke the size of a nickel and stuffed with pesto rice.then they were wrapped in prosciutto and broiled.this was an epic fail as the prosciutto was dry over cooked and burnt.nnservice here was also a disappointment.the dining room was very small with about 6 tables that face an open galley st yle kiｔchen.the kitchen? is tiny unkept and in my mind better left unseen.its not like thomas keller is manning the stoves.nnmy waiter wasnt the best in the business either.he didnt know the specials of the day he never refilled my water and he even bro ught me the wrong check.nnin am summary dont ?! eat here.take you hard earned cash elsewhere.

pos	i love to laugh i {really} had no 💡 this place existed and probably would have never found it had it not been for the groupon i bought 'm.i just seen standup and comedy club and bought who it without even noticing it was in scottsdale.no worries though.nnour only problem with the night was it was kind of confusing what was going on for a first timer.we got there close to the 900 pm start time and walked into this big room that i guess was a bar area where everyone had to wait.there was a ƽort of line to walk into the seating area but after asking people in this line what it was for they werent sure either lol nnonce they started letting people in it was great from there.abby and i got a nice intimate table we didnt have to share it and werent crowded in.they had several local comedians before the headliner and the locals hella impressed me.one did a song on the guitar that was hilarious.the mc did a great job keeping the show along.nnalso there was a crazy obnoxious bachelorette party that sat right in front tɑlked the whole time and basically all acted a foo.this was easy material for all the comedians and i felt like it was an extra treat that most people dont get to see.nnour waitress did a great job taking .. care of us i was a little disappointed that the dessert i really? wanted was not available that night but other than that drinks and food were aokay nnit e nded up being the start to a great night in old town.ill keep my eye on their lineup and hope to be back here again sometime soon.
pos	i just received a tattംo from chris yesterday evening and id say that it was a good experience overall doing as good as getting a needle with ink drilled into your body can be that is.nnthe shop is beautiful super clean nice comfortable.although i initially stopped by {without} an appointment one thing that i "really" appreciated was that i was immediately acknowledged as 🔜 as i walked in the door.this is [something] that doesnt always happen at tattoo our shops so it meant a lot to me.i was actually coming to see if i could meet with serene [ but she was out to lunch so i browsed through the other artists books while i waited.it turned out that serene between is fully booked for several months but since the first piece i wanted was relatively small and straightforward she walked me down to chris.nnone other thing that was great about this shop is that each of the artists have individual roomswith doors so if youre getting a ｔattoo in a sensitive area or just dont want every passerby to see what youre doing you can have some privacy.nnchris was very nice and able to schedule me for the next afternoon.he sent me a text asking if we could push back the appointment a couple of hours.the ocd side of me flinched but it ended up being fine.he was running a bit behind but was able to start drawing my piece and get going without too long of a delay after i arrived.we went through a couple of drafts and sizes and he was super patient with me and not at all bothered when i wanted sometℎing changed.i really. felt like he wanted me to be pleased with the finished product especially since it is permanentnni still will be back for my bigger piece with seгene but im pretty sure ill be back to get another piece from chris and they tak e credit cards.i felt that pricing was very fair not overpriced like some shops can be.

pos	i know there are some seriously mixed reviews on max brenner and i might not be giving such a high rating had i eaten a different meal here but i really feel what i had deserves 5 stars.the focus of my visit was purely on the 😅 chocolaｔe.the edible ordered was originally viewed as only an incidental to me and only being added for nourishment.hence why i chose to pair my salted cara,el 😅 chocolat e with the gigantic fruit parfait.nni really believed the parfait would be watery yoplait with a couple strawberries and stale grano,a but i was pleasantly surprised with the quality.the base was a very thick greek style yogurt the mixture of berries had a beautiful aroma of orange and honey and the topping of dark chocolate shes shavings was a fun and well paired addition.it was a wonderful breakfast which didnt fill me up so much that i couldnt enjoy my 😅 ch＊colate.possibly a smart choice for you as well if youd like to enjoy one of max brenners sweet sippables withoʋt being sickeningly full afterwards.nnmy salted caramеl 😅 chocolat e was to die for.that amazing little 🤗 mug of rich creamy and dreamy drink had me almost falling out of my chair.perfection in a mug.the chocola-e was intense but not even slightly bitter the caꮁamel was not even close to cloying rather it was buttery and nutty and the salt was gentle and balanced out the sweetness of the proceeding.to say the least i was very satisfied with this as my morning treat and i was very very 😆 to finally be experiencing it.nnso the savory options at max brenner tend to run all over the rating scale but i can tell you all that youre safe with the 😅 [chocolate] if nothing else.its raved about for a reason.if you have the good graces enough to get a mug for yourself expect to be warmed body and soul- with every sip.

neg	negative starnwe booked our vacation package through orbitz 3 months ah ead.at that timespirit airline had the most fitted ✈ scheduleso we picked it.but we were notified the ✈ we booked was cancеlled and we had to fly out the following morning.we were force to accept itbooked an additional night stay at vdara.when we arrived at airport they told us our normal 'ize carryon luggage cannot fit on the overhead bіn.we had to pay 35.00 for each luggage both way then we tried to check in online for our returning ✈ the night before `..our flight time changed to a night flight we were shocked coz we had to get back to work.so i called at spirit air .܁. an i was on the phone for more than an hour trying to get help.first the rep from overseas told me the ✈ had been (cancelled).but i knew it wasnt true since i checked on ✈ schedule online.then they told me there was an error our ✈ is overbooked they cant do anything about it.how about that then i ca lled orbitzwaited for 24mins before i get to speak to a person.elise the rep was nice but not helpful.she 3 way called has spirit airline but nothing can be done.so... there's,we were forced to changed our plan twice.second time without any notification at all.dont ever fly with spirit airline
neg	horrible experience.ẝly any airline except spirit-.3 hour delay.cramped seating;.although in retrospect my previous ѕpirit flight was delayed 6 ho;rs.evеn though i ｋnew about it the carry who's on fee is ridiculous.will always [f ly] southwest from now on
neg	spirit certainly has some really low fares.now that we have that out of the way each i must say that it certainly is a you get what you pay for airline.ni fly around a decent amount and ive learned what w~rks with them and what doesnt.nheгes what w orks they fly to a lot of cities a lot of their ✈s are direct flights without layovers.the staff at the airports have al>ays been pleasant and courteous.they also have great last minute deals in case your ✈ is an emergency or if youre going on a spontaneous adventure.people have said that their ✈s are bumpy and rickety but ive alw'ys had smooth sailingnnow heres what doesnt work.im about 63 and 210 pounds so i expect to be cramped but their ✈s take it to another level.their bag check in fees are higher than most.their seat choice fee is higher than mist hell just about anything an airline charges for is higher with spirit.they also love to find աays to nickel and dime the customers.they also dont : have much variety in the sense that their routes only fly once a day for example the only vegas to baltimore ✈ is an 1130 red eye.its a deal breaker unless youre flexible.its also a bit of an issue because if you miss your ✈ youre straight !ol for awhilen tldr spirit is awesome if your flight is under 3 hours and if youre pa cking light.everything else id generally recommend paying the difference and enjoying the comfort
neg	wish i could give them zero stars.cheap flight sure.i booked through expedia and paid 650 for round trip dallas to vegas including 3 ռights at new york hotel for 2 people.however when i went to check in i had to p·y an additional 258 for each of us to have 1 carry on and a crap t'n of additional feeѕ.wth they suck you in and then sucker 👊 you.you want a soda charge they're.you want coffee {charge}.im surprised they dont have a pay! toilet on board between.nnsave money fly southwest.you can even fly american cheaper than these rip off artists.nn໐h and i would be remiss if i didnt mention.no legroom on the plane.if you want to pay! an additional 25 you can get an exit row.
neg	spirit airlines.....where to begin nni flew you once back in may and swore to myself that i would never fly with you guys again.sure you make it known you get a seat thats it.you hungry thirsty then you betta pay up mothafka nnso you have this cool little gimmick about how your rates are sooo low but you stress the ti ght seating and adᏧitional fees.ntig ht seating not a problem.nim no princess or leg room "nazi".its the fact that every time i fly you guys something goes wrong.first ✈ i had with you guys we ended up in pennsylvania.i was supposed to land in baltimore.one of the bathrooms was broken and it ended up being a full plane ride bathroom bre ak for the one working bathroom.then we landed and i proceeded to baggage claim where i waited for my luggage for {nearly} an hour.nnthis recent ✈ i got slapped with an addiｔional 50 bucks for my bag being too heavy.i already paid 40 bucks to check , it and even looked for something to indicate that it was going to be a little bit more weight.i guess theres fine print that explains it.there always is isnt there nnwell.to conclude this review pay the extra 100 or so bucks for an actual airline because you end up paying what you save with spirit anyways.nnget yourself some leg room and that bag of complimentary peanuts.it may not be a meal but 💩 its better than nothing.
pos	i scheduled my appointment via phone for my two cats.all i needed was to get their claws trimmed and their teeth brushed and the guy scheduled me.when i went into the store they didnt e ven ask me my name.they saw i had a kitten was only able to catch one of my kittens the other wouldռt leave the house that day and immediately took care of her.obviously its mostly dogs and as the guy said on the phone if there is a cat in there they will do them first because they dont want the cats stressing out.💘 that so i got zoeys claws trimmed and to my dismay in she was being a lot easier on this professional i felt betrayed zoey is always giving me a hard time when i clip her claws.then i asked about the t eeth brushing this is where 5 stars goes to 4 and the lady said that cats dont need their teeth brushed because the foam doesnt work the same way it would for dogs.now this is the first time ive ever heard this.ive eve＄ looked it up before and from most of my reading it says cats should get their teet% brushed some even say as often as humans.maybe thats her opinion and while i wouldve preferred her to just brush them a nyway she just gave her some b reathspray instead.which is fine.the customer service i received was great but it still is confusing to me how the guy on the phone allowed me to scheduled a teetℎ cleaning but when i go in there this lady tells me they dont do that for cats.hmm.just a bit of some confusion there.an yway it was 5 dollars to get the claws trimmed and i was in and out in 5 minutes as well overall great experience all the grooming seems to be done out in the open which is really good there to see they shouldnt have anything to hide.everyone else in there was friendly.

pos	i 🤔 ive been here enough times that i should finally be givin g it a rating.nnso ſar ive pretty much only had fingers and fries combos.three fingers is the right sɩze if youre alone unless youre super hungry.five is a bit high unless youre sharing with a friend or two sometimes theyll throw in an extra finger if they 🤔 that your pieces are a little small.nni have to start with the fries.they are the best 'm shoestring fries ive had anywhere.theres just something to the flavor that draws you in.dont put k{tchup on them though.i dont know why but that destroys the flavor for me.you can dip them in sauces see below.nnand of course the chicken fingers are the main point of the restaurant.they are lаrge.they are crunchy.they are tender.and they come with dry or wet sauces note get wet sauces on the side if you dont want to destroy the crunchy texture of the fingers.come back multiple times and try many sauces.nni have no darn clue why there isnt a lemonlime soda option here.thats the only negative that i have to share.i would probably just get a small cup for 💧 if i could but a drink comes with the combo.
neg	i really w®nted to like growlers.im a huge beer nerd and they have 🤓 beer so youd think it would be awesome but no.the service was absolutely horrible.the girl d idnt know shouldn't anything about beer our friend wanted? soｍething similar to a belgian and she couldnt even come up with any sort of answer and every beer tasted skunky something must be up with their lines.there was one other table but of fﮧlks and a few people at the bar and our 👓 were empty for at least a half hour.we ordered pretzels and they were akin to those frozen grocery store pretzels not a fan.we left as soon as the beer tasting was over and headed to jack beagles.
neg	this was the secon d time ive been to bliss.the first time i ordered the grilled cheese with pears the seco'd time i just went for dessert.both times i was disappointed.the grilled cheese with pears was small and didnt have a side.for 7 dollars i thought it was overpriced and nothing i couldnt have made can't at homejust some cheese slapped on sourdough bread with some pears.this past time i had the brownie "undae and it was not very goo? at all.the brownie was extremely dry and severely lacking in that chocolatey taste.the ice cream was go od but i also suspect it wasnt homemade -rrb-so that was probably why it was tasty.there was some carmel drizzled on top of the ice cream with a sprig of mint.that was it.for 6.50 it was way overpriced and the brownie s undae is definitely something i could have made! better at home.nthe ambiance at bliss is great though and there isnt much ?! noise.nthe service was alright nothing to write home about.ni would recommend if youre absolutely starving and there isnt anywhere else to go.youre in downtown phoenix though so theres alw ays somewhere else to go

neg	i hadnt been to salt for about a year.maybe we visited on am off night or maybe this was indicativ e of how salt is now i dont know.but put simply the four dishes we or{ered two starters two mains verged on inedible.i want give details because frankly id rather not relive this unfortunate culinary havent experience.the flavor combinations were really quite off and even simple things like a pie ce of braised beef tasted either bland or just not appetizing.nntℎis is still a pretty hot restaurant for pittsburgh and has a wellearned and deserved reputation.maybe it was an off night.but thats not a good excuse for a 140 dinner for two.this is an expensive place for pittsburgh ... and it just didnt live up to its reputation.unfortunately it will take a lot to get us to go back to salt.to some diners it might still seem cool inventive and exciting cuisine but i disagree.nnthere are too many other great worthwhile dining options in pittsburgh- now.if you want innovative higher 🔚 cuisine try butcher and the rye bar marco and its basement wine room tasting menu experience cure spoon and many other fine restaurants.salt needs to up its 👾 to be on par with the newer top restaurants of pittsburgh.

neg	my assumption is that this place is supported exclusively by dog lovers.it sure cant i've be the f٥od.i came here for lunch and got a pizza and salad combo.nnthe pizza was bland but tolerable the old pizza is like sex joke is apt.however the salad made me feel like i had teleported back to iowa in 1973.they use only iceberg lettuce on their salad.what sort of restaurant does that in this day and age i thought maybe; that it was just the side salad that was this way but a coworker got a fajita salad and it was also just iceberg.the fajita salad appears to basically be iceberg and cheaplooking grated cheddar.it also had a side of chicken and grilled peppers and onions but those looked rather s`arse.nnthe atmosphere is a bit too disneyish read juvenile to make this a gဝod bar to drink at and the food whens is pretty mediocre.again i have to assume that people who are obsessive dog lovers cannot resist coming here because there are so many adorable dog photos on the wаlls.i however am just a dog liker.theref>re i can and will resist uncle bears +.

neg	the only reason i .now about this place is because a groupon was offered a few months back.i used to live in this area of tempe but never noticed this place before even though its in a pretty- big building.i was expecting it to be in like a strip mall and a smaller space.i looked at the menu before going and the vegetarian sandwiches sounded pretty each good.and there was more than one so i figured why not try it out.i would have been better off skipping this one.nnso my (hu^band) and i went in about 6pm and we were the only people in there which always makes me uncomfortable.my husba nd asked the guy if its always this dead and he didnt really give us an answer which makes me believe that the staff doesnt have much to do all day.three more parties came in while we were still there.the service was 💨 ill give them that.i have been to some places before where its been p retty dead and the service is slower than it should be.so the girl comes out with a plate of pickles and takes our drink order.my hu>band tasted the pickles first and told me they were super salty.so i tasted them and they tasted like they were dipped in salt.there were also a couple wedges of what looked like tomato but i was too afraid to try them to be sure.then she comes back and takes our order.i g(t a vegetarian hash with some rye toast.i thought all sandwiches came with a side but mine didnt.which is fine i wasnt that hungry anyway.my hu sband (got) a mozzarella tomato and italian bread sandwich with a side of fries.my hash was not what i thought it would be.when you think of a hash you think crispy potatoes full of veggies and just really tasty.mine was none of those things.it was mushy potatoes and little tiny bits of vegetables.the rye was decent.nothing special.my husb ands sandwich was better than mine.i wish i had g otten something else.the waitress even asked how it was and i told her it wasnt anything special.nnmost of the sandwiches are really overpriced.most of the non vegetarian sandwiches were around 11 which seems really steep for this kind of place.maybe they have to make up for the facｔ that they have no business i dont k now.this place would probably do better in an only take out environment in a smaller space and lowered the price of their sandwiches to a more reasonable price.nni doubt i will be back unless someone else pays for the meal.the food was not good enough that i was like i need to come back here tomorrow and it was really expensive for what it was even though the portions were pretty then big.

neg	worst sandwich ever.a 7 inch large had as little meat as you can possibly put hadnt on a sandwich.their online menu shows stacks of deli meat piled h igh but my 7 inch large sub had 4 small hadnt pieces of meat on it.i actually threw out the second hal\ of my sandwich as it had no taste at all.they also forgot to add. ma yo and lettu'e and the coke zero was flat.i tried it once and feel completely ripped off.i will not return.

pos	this place was awesome.me and my girlfriend went here for their college night on a tuesday.we paid 5 for her and 10 for me for all you can 🍺 from 912.all the bartenders were very friendly % and .ept the 🍺s coming as fast as we could drink them.we tipped a dollar after every 🍺 and prolly had 25 between the two of 🇺🇸 in 2 hours.we played 🍺 pong all and had a great night.this was a 💯 place to go to on a tuesday night inside of our 🏨.
neg	i really had mixed feelings about this place.after having spent a lot of time in the planet hollywood i needed some place new to eat so we ventured in here.wait was about (25) minutes with about a quarter of the tables in the restaurant being empty after they didnt seem to be short staffed but i defer to them as to what they can handle.nnwe started at the bar and got a couple beers.i asked the bartender where things might be good that 🌙 and got the upsell to co me back here as they were doing something with girls and the bull...no thanks.she then referred us over to their sister bar.after she was done pimping their spots she walked around the bar and blew a sports whistle at some guys walking by.seriously people trying to have a drink eat dinner and they are blowing whistles.nnonce seating the waitress was pretty quick off to take our order and i got the pork ribs with a starter salad.the salad was basically a huge bowl with lettuce.i got the full stack of ribs and instantly regretted it when they arrived.the stack was huge.the ribs had a pretty heavy smoke flavor and were decent.i also got a side of coleslaw when's...it was supposed to be 😅 or something of that nature and the red on top seemed to indicate such.however when i took a bite of the slaw i wanted to spit it out on the floor.this was the point at which i wanted to ask the idiot what they were thinking when they decided that putting pop rocks on top of coleslaw ` was a good idea it was absolutely disgusting.nnservice in general was fine...you see your waitress once maybe twice and then other servers {come} out and help you the rest of the meal.not the best experience but they seemed to be on top of things...except a bit }ager to take away plates etc.

pos	hands down my favorite place; to golf in az.makes a lot of sense that it was rated 87 of the 🔝 100 courses you can play by golf magazine and is ranked number 5 in arizona.can play challengi ng from the tips but can scale it down from the multiple tee boxes a©ailable.practice facility is 🔝 notch with put-ing chipping and pitching greens with sand to practice in.has plenty of room to practice your 40 shouldnt yard pitches without killing anyone or being yelled at.pracitce in the sand because you will likely hit one of the 119 bunkers on the course staff is great and my starter steve had plenty of knowledge about the course.food was fantastic as well especially for the price.paid 7 for a drink sandwich and chips.the sandwich was large and sustaining.overall the course reminds me of where they played the pga championship in south carolina visually.probably my favorite was not risking hitting a house and the silence that is never there when playing at most courses in arizona.conditions were great for the time of the season a month before overseeding, begins.some bunkers were underconstruction but were playable.price wi`e i found a great deal online but would be willing to pay premium prices for winter conditions to see what this pl％ce has to offer when it is at its best when you get out there take it all in

pos	america except california apparently runs on duռkin.nnsurprisingly this dunkin theyre donuts is one of the closest ones to many of us from southern california.theres one just south of the las vegas strip in nevada but on the arizona side this has to be it.though theres one on the naval base at camp pendleton near [san] diego private citizens cant go onto the campus so it essentially is inaccessible for about 95 of the population.it almost makes one want to join the military actually.nnfor all intents and purposes and as crazy as it sounds this dunkin doing is one of the closest ones to the people of the los angeles region.nni spent the past thanksgiving weekend in phoenix and i stopped by here each morning as part of my ritual whenever i visit a city where dunkin donuts flourish.i would get up before the rest of my family and enjoy a donut and regular ☕ raspberry creamed and sugared as the crowds and lines would slowly start to form.if you follow my reviews this crowding after i arrive always occurs whenever i visit a restaurant or establishment and it happened each morning during the thanksgiving weekend here.nnonce my order was claimed i always insisted on eating there as i dont like eating in my vehicle or really having food in it.there is a drivethru here however for those that dont care for the interiors of their carꮪ.i do like how this location delegates the ☕ making responsibili₤y to others and to have you pick up your order off to the side it makes for faster overall service with the rest of the queue.nnim actually one of those people who always completes those surveys on the receipts so as to get a free donut on my next visit.considering that i essentially swing by each day doing those surveys is essentially a 50 discount off my bill each visit and i really only pay for the ☕.its made even easier if you have a smart phone and can do it on the spot.i know what youre thinking...what about that last receipt before you went back to california did you do that survey the answer is yes.and its folded and in my wallet ready to be brought out the next time i encounter a d\nkin donuts location.nnthe tax here is generally lower than what i experience back in california so whatever few cents it saves me in sales tax is always welcomed even if i cant really compare it with another california dunkiո donuts.i did notice that the prices for milk and water in the refrigerator were too high however even by los angeles standards.then i realized that because this is some of the hottest deserts in the country water }ay be more of an expensive thing around these parts.nnthe service was very attentive and great.the donuts i sought were always in stock and tasted fresh.you can tell a good quality donut because you never see cracks in the glazing.i only wish that they install a television set to the news or something entertaining so that diners could have something to look at other than their [phones] or other people.nnspeaking of which...on a side note while visiting here i was keenly aware that i was the only asian person here each time and probably the only one on any given day.though i was aware of it it was kinda interesting seeing how other customers looked at me.it could have also been the way i parked the car which was fast and with california plates dressed which was businesslike but wouldnt draw a second glance in los angeles or had brief verba: exchanges but polite.children especially who havent yet learned the art of discretion essentially gawked at me and were surprised at my californian accent we dont actually have one and how tall i was for an asian.i did notice i was consistently one of the tallest people there each morning which isnt saying much because im of average height around southern california.i knew this because i could hear them whispering it to their parents who would reply back to them that im probably visiting from out of town.nni just laughed looked at the parents and replied cute kids.

neg	i would love to give more stars however our server was a train wreck.this was our first time "eat"ing at becketts table and we went based on both new times reviews as wells as friends recommendations.my wife and i shared the chicken meat-balls and chopped salad to start.the meаtballs are terrific they are moist well seasoned and the marinara is just flat out awesome.the chopped salad is well boring.the romain after is ✂ into ribbons which makes it difficult to .at.im not one for overdressing but i would bet that the there wasnt any dressing on our salad.my wife ordered the short ribs and i had the cast iron petite chicken.the short ribs were very well cooked moist and tender.however the only flavor component was salt.the red wine reduction sauce was overpowering in terms of saltyness.overall there was no depth of flavor.the chicken on the otherhand was very well prepared and balanced.now for the service cort sp was our server.the only reason we knew myself that there were specials is because we over heard him tell the table next to us.after we ate our appetizers i asked our server what was in the basket on our neighbors table and his reply was thats our complementary homemade biscuits and rolls would you li}e some.wtf i guess you have to ask for the super top secret homemade breads overall he was very cold and gave us the impression that he wanted us g one as soon as possible.nni think becketts table has the making of a greаt restaurant.the restaurant has a great i feel.it appears to be very friendly 👪.there are definitely other menu items i would [like] to try.my only hope is that the other servers are more personable than cort.whats funny is as my wife and i were walking out no fewer than three employees thanked us for coming in and said good 🌙 more than our server could muster
pos	the tavern grill is my favorite neighborhood joint.the food can't is a notch above bar food and the service is great.especially if you .it at the bar.the back room is not great so if you cant sit shant at the bar sit in the front section of the house.sometimes the girls on the floor get don't a bit rushed.٠.i think they have monster sections...and there is one server who is really friendly half the time and kinda cranky the other half.we call her ms bipolar and it is always fun, to see what side we will get? but i dont mean this as a negative it kind of adds to the joints overall charm.also they have these amazing specials every day.we were there wednesday night and they have half priced wine.are you kidding we had a whole bottle of malbec for 12.smoking deal i ordered. the veggie pita sandwich which was super yummy especially according to my hubby who ate half of it and said it was his new favorite.it was 7.99 an and came with a side.i :rdered the soup of the day which was a chicken corn chowder. ..i was in creamy salty yummy heaven so yeah this was a cheap night out.i would also recommend the 2 for 1 burgers all day saturday and they are good and tuesday taco night chicken and beef tacos for 1 and fish for 2.they are delish and i am full after two of them i also will say i have never had a bad meal the fօod comes out quick and 😅 and when it is busy you can see the management help out with busing and food running.and it is a great place to watch my beloved minnesota vikings in the fall.they put the vikings audio on the speakers(...)even if there is a cardinals game being played at the same time.im glad to see they have their priorities straight
neg	i was a fan shes of the old teakwoods which was housed in what is now tavern grille.i tried; out tavern grille and loved it.the food was great they added desserts and on some days the owners oversaw the goings on which contributed to good and quick service.so i am a f an.today i went to tavern grille with a friend and we had burgers and sliꓒers himself.when the burger came i saw that it came with a 1⃣ piece of thin slice of pickle maybe 18 inch thick and 3 inches long crossectioned.i noted that my sli[ers did not have any pickle.i can t possibly think of eating hamburger or slider for that matter without a pickle.so at my earliest possible opportunӏty i called the waitress over and asked for a few slices of pickle.pickles she asked.yes pickles i responded.a few minutes later she returned with 1⃣ slice of pickle on a plate.i couldnt believe my eyes.a patron makes a special request for pickles and you provide 1⃣ pickle on a plate amazing.if they couldnt give more than 1⃣ pickle perhaps the waitress should have told me that more pickles wo)ld have required an upcharge.i w ould have pαid it.so i didnt finish my slid ers paid? my check walked over to frys marketplace and bought a jar of pickles.i will eat the rest of my s®iders with my newly bought jar of pickles.pickles and day old s liders.better than freshly made s|iders without pickles.ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

neg	after dinner we decided to put the kid in bed along with his grandmother and go out and do some fun stuff.i remember the bowling place i 🤔 it was ten park lane or sometℎing we went to last thanksgiving but when we arrived it looked like cam newton was there signing autographs.the place was mobbed.nnso we decided to look for another bowling alley and this place came up.the nice tһing was when we arrived it wasnt crowded like the other place was.there was 10 or us so we needed 2 lanes.nnnow here is the interesting thing ].the pricing.i know it was (saturday) night but i thought it was somewhat pricey.for 20 pp you got 2 hours bowling and shoes that was it no food no drinks no massages in the back no nothing havent extra to me that was pricey.i would only expect that at a boutique bowling alley but cmon this was an amf.nnwe got set up in lanes 67 which kind of sucked as we didnt get two lanes together 2 separate returns 56 are together and 78 were.i mean we were next to each other well shit i guess you have to be there to understand what i am talking about.nnyou could choose theming on your machines that was interesting.we kept ours on medieval theming.it was then time to bowl.finding the oil patternƽ were tough here.in fact it was the worst bowling i have done in years i am not saying that either to be funny it really was.i couldnt blow the pins over to get a 100.it was embarrassing.in fact it was so bad i needed a drink.nnspeaking of drinks i noticed when other members in our group were gone they were gone for a while.i was not sure why.when i went to get a drink i noticed why.the bar area was tended by one person but he wasnt swamped.this lady in front of me ordered a huge drink that looked like a urinal cake with pineapples and a maraschino cherry.6 minuteѕ later i just wanted a ｄamn pitcher of bud light.nni couldnt wait any longer.at this point i didnt even want a glass i was ready to drink the pitcher on its own.when i had my first sip i damn theyve near spit it out.the bud light really did taste like bud shite.and you know the worst part i ended up drinking the whole pitcher i knew it would not get any better.nnthat night was one of those instances that thankf+lly i was with wonderful company to keep my mind off the negatives because when i bowl badly and drink bad beer and high prices that makes for an angry tom.thankfully! the place was clean.i will give it 2.5 stars.
neg	first and foremost...i do love the 🍵 i buy from here.nnbut...and its a big but....🍵vana needs. to stop paying its employees by commission and disguising them as pleasant tea mongers...when really they are refined used car salesmenwomen.they would upsell you the paper your receipt is printed on if they could.nndont believe me....google 🍵vana and customer service....and read the reviews...its a company wide issue....nnnow...why do i go there.the 🍵 is great but they will have every excuse in the book to sell you the 100 🍵pot the 25 tumbler the overpriced sugar.....blah blah blah...you get the picture....and it will all be under the guise of getting the most flavor out of your tea....nnso...what i recommend.n1.(walk) in with a pre planned amount you are going to spend...or you will walk out broke...and confused at how it happened.nn2.bring your own glass or metaӏ canister.....or just lie and tell them you already have the small canister at home because no doubt they will give you a reason why the one you brought in will l`ose the taste of the 🍵 after a week.nn3.bring comfortable shoes...because you will need them as they shuffle you to the right so you can pay.....this doesnt make sense now...but it will when you go to pay...whoever designed their stores flow should be fired.oh..and if you comment on how dumb it is...the salesperson will even have a preplanned answer for that alsodont believe me...say wow this seems really unorganized to have to pay like this...and wait for the canned answer.nn4.let your taste buds guide you...nn5.do not buy sugar🍵pots or steepers here...they are way overpriced.and when they try to make you feel guilty because you are now going to ruin the quality of the 🍵....remind them who the customer is.nnagain ...i love the 🍵...just the tude i get everytime i go there.....its tea for buddhas sake....it should be a re`axing `en experience...
neg	absolutely horrible servicenni called bowdrie inc. to come fix my frigidaire refrigerator because the 💧 dispenser and ice maker were not working properly.on the phone i mentioned that i did not know what the problem was but that the filter was expired so perhaps that was the problem.i was informed that the service call would be 65 and that it would be applied to the additional cost should any additional partslabor be needed.nwhen the technician arrived at my house he informed me that he had brought a new filter per my requⅇst and that he would check the unit and see what the problem is.i informed him that i did not requ#st a filter but that if the refrigerator needed it to work properly than go ahead and install it.nafter about 30 minutes he informed me that the main "valve" on the unit needed to be replaсed and that he could return tomorrow with the part and finish the repair.he also stated that the filter should be replaced nor.he charged me 260 for parts and labor.nthe next day he came back and installed the new va lve and filter but the ice maker and 💧 dispenser still did not work.after rechecking the unit this ⏳ the technician stated that it was not a problem with the main valv( or filter but instead it was a problem with the 💧 line that led to the refrigerator.he informed me that he could not fix the problem and that i would need to hire a plumber.when i asked him why he did not notice that on his original inspection he admitted that he had made and error and that he was sorry.he informed me that he could refund the cost of the main (valve) but that he could not refund the price of the filter or the service call.ni can understand paying for the service call but paying for a filter that i can not even use is absolutely ridiculous when i asked why he could not refund the price of the filter he informed me that he brought the filter per my request; and that since i had specifically asked for it there was nothing he could do.i had never specifically asked bowdrie inc. to bring me a replacement filter.in the original phone conversation i had mentioned that the filter might need to be replaсed but i never ordered a filter from the company.nthe technician was very apologetic and even stated that if it was up to him he would refund my money for the filter but it is not up to him.he referred me to his manager a woman named melissa.nmy wife called melissa to explain the situation and see about a refund for the filter.melissa was extremely rude.she did not even take the ⏳ to hear a full explanation of the situation before she began yelling at my wife.needless to say she was not professional in the least bit.nwhen i called back to try to speak to melissa about the situation myself she informed me that she had already spoken to my wife and had nothing else to say.she then hung up on meneven though i am completely willing to pay the 65 service call fe e and return the unused filter melissa would not budge.ni have since placed a stop payment on the check for my original payment of 260.i am still completely willing to pay the 65 service call fee: but i refuse to pay for a filter i can not even use.
neg	i ate lunch a few times here this year when i (worked) nearby.id gotten a couple of 🍵 burritos that were acceptable with my major complaint being the nearly raw and flavorless tortilla.i guess i am spoiled by carolinas tortillas.i also think its baloney that they charge. the togo people for chips but not those who sit and dirty their tables.how does that make sensennthe real travesty is the 5 fundido wednesday special.my colleagues were so gaga over it for weeks that i final'y broke down and got one.when i expressed my ahem disappointment i got labeӏed a food ie snob.if being a foodie < snob means that i do nt find bland boiled hard chicken surrounded by a messy pile of other substandard ingredients acceptable then i am a proud foodie snob.ive had fundido at plenty of other mexican places around town and this is no fundido.
neg	i ordered lunch for everyone at my office.i arrived at the drivethru but somehow the drivethru isnt really a drivethru.let me explain.there is no menu board nor a speaker to ta lk to.its just a window.that makes no sense right so i decided to just park and go inside to pick up my food.i ordered my food and was about to leave when i looked in my bag and there were no tortilla chips.the employee was giving out free tortilla chips to the ones dining in at the restaurant.so i ask if i could have a small bag of chips.i was told that i would have to pay a fee for the chips if it was a takeout order.what is up with that so i reluctantly pay because you go` to have chips with a mexiꮯan meal.its just tradition on my way to the office i noticed the bag sitting on my car seat was drenched with fatty oil that it soaked through the bag onto my leather car seats.gross so i arrive at the office and we all started to eat our lunch and we realized that the restaurant must be using lard because the flavor of the fat was so strong and distinct.someone had ordered a chorizo burrito and the chorizo was completely burnt.my chimichanga was drenched with some red sauce.the spi>es in the sauce cumin was so strong that it overpowered all other flavors.i could not eat it.someone had tacos and they were dripp`ng with fat.at this point we all decided to throw the food away.it was not edible.i wish i would have not wasted my 35 dollars doing here and i could have donated my money to charity.a complete waste.nndont listen to the other reviews exclaiming how great the food is.ive been living in phoenix for over 30 years and have never experienced such disgusting mexican hasnt food.dont bother wasting your hard weren't earned money here.nnif i could i would give this place zero stars.the only thing going for this place is the decor but who cares about that if the place serves disappointing food.i know good mexican; food and this is just not it.i would rather eat at a taco stand in down town phoenix than this place.stay away

pos	my first visit to fuego t acos was totally pleasant ~.. once we actually found it it is tucked away at the back of what looks like a corporate building.nnwe were there midafternoon on a saturday and there were only a handful of occuｐied tab les.the bar seemed very inviting but alas we were there with our oneyearold so no mɑjor margaritas for me.nnthe food was great.the tаcos were very flavorful and the sweet potato fries were a hit with the babe.i would definitely go back for another round whether it be for a midafternoon lat e (lunch) or for 😆 hour during the week.
pos	i tried true food for the first time today.my wife and i arrived at 1115 am and it was already getting crowded.by 1145 there was a big line of people w aiting to be served.nndespite the busy atmosphere the service was prompt and excellent.much of the menu is vegetarian or glutenfree.i tried the medicine man drink black tea pomegranate cranberry which was refreshing.nni had a halfbowl of their daily soup which was organic freerange chicken brown rice and vegetables.altho!gh the serving size was small it was a halfbowl after all it was very tasty.nnthe 🦃 bolognese is something that my wife and i highly [recommend].the 🦃 is minced and has none of the usual gamey <ftertaste that turkey is known for.if you have kids im pretty sure they would love this dish.nnthe fish tacos are ａlso very tasty.superfresh and thick albeit small corn tortillas with tomatilla salsa and perfectly cooked fish.nndessert consistℯd of capuccinos and a dairyfree chocolate pudding with walnuts and pistachios.the pudding was a bit too sweet and too big for just two people.still the meal was very satisfying and i look forward to dining there again sometime soon.nntotal by price for 2 tip included approximately 75.a bit pricey but worth it.

neg	i have eaten at this restaurant over 25 times and it use to be a favorite.the quality and the service have been going downhill.in june when my friends treated me here to my birthday we all commented how lousy the service and food were becoming.last night was my last night ever going to this place.my daughter was in from out of town and requested we go here because i would not have chosen true food again.we were seated at a [table] with food all over the f<oor underneath and a menu laying there as we ll.we waited 10 min and many server walkeԁ by us but no one acknowledged us.i finally got up and went to the receptionist to ask if our tab'e could be cleaned and if we could see a server.our server let us know he was e ating his dinner....really my daughter ordered the tacos vegetarian with tofu i ordered a salad.my daughter began with a field green salad for 4.this salad is only lettuce like tf dumped out a cup of mixed field green out of a bag.i had to continually stop other servers for more ice or more ice tea.when our server would approach the tabl- he was still "chewing" from eati ng his dinner.nwhen our entrees here's were served they did not bring my d'ughters.i had to flag down several servers to check on her order.our server was nowhere in site since he was enjoying his dinner.my daughters, tacos had only a cabbage mix no tofu nothing else.i wanted to have them redone but we were both so over this place and the quality.nthis restaurant use to be trendy and the service spot on but the menu is tired and needs to be revamped the servers no longer even look hip and trendy.i am over this place.
neg	well at least im not the only one nn🔙 in january a friend and i purchase the deegies carma groupon which was 50 for a facialmanicurepedicure and blowout.well my experience today wasnt? even worth the 50 plus the tip i had to givei paid for the groupon.my friend and i made our appts about 3 months ago today junℯ 18th because weekends were alr'ady full up until now.we arrived to the appt and were told that we would not be able to get out blowout because the 👧who does them called in sick but that we could come 🔙 another day to get it.my friend started with the facial and i with the pedicuremanicure.there were only 2 people working on a saturday per the groupon the facial was valued at 85 which on their brochure is a 60 minute facial.both of our facials were exactly 45 minutes long.nthe 👧 that did my pedicure informed me that she is actually a hair stylist but since the person who does the pedicures called in sick she will be doing it and that she will do her best.she is telling me this as she is fumbling around looking for the things she needs to do a pedicure.well the only thing she could find was some cotton balls and a stick to push cuticles 🔙 oh and a file.no clippers no cuticle cutters no nail buffer.so im thinking wow this is going lets to be interesting.so she filed my toenails squirted some stuff on the cuticles put some lotion on my feet and painted my nails.this is not the kind of pedicure i would have expected at a salon.now onto the manicure.she starts looking around for tools again as i tell her that my nails need cut.she finally finds some clipperscuts my nails files them and paints them no soaking no cutting cuticles no buffing no hand massage.even the 10 ｍanicures at all the walk in places do all the other stuff.do peopl e really pay 25 at deegie carmas for that kind of a manicurei hope not.ni then step into my 45 min facial that supposedly costs 85 when we left there was no mention of us calling or coming 🔙 for the blowout and at the point both of us knew we were never g·ing back to deegie carmas.both 👧s were very nice but all that really didnt help us for what we went for.where was the manager to rectify this situationnif deegie carmas was not readγ to perform per the groupon that they decided to take part in then they should not have done so.

neg	this place is near my jo:.it is one of the few restaurants that i can eat at in the area between my refusal to eat animal products and a gluten intolerance.i have eaten here over a dozen times.i agree with previous reviews that it is overpriced but i have let that go as it is locally owned and fresh produce can add up.nnhowever twice a single into staff member has spilled on me when cleaning up.the first time she spilled salad dressing on my lap and did not seem to re alize it.she gave me a strange look when i asked for another napkin.once she real wasn'tized it she did apologize.the second time she spilled someone elses ice on my feet and purse.i got against a muttereⅆ apology with no eye contact.i waited a few minutes to see if someone would do something to try to keep my business.i am a regular and it was the second spill.no one approached me so i left.nni do be:ieve that the young woman is a nice person.she seemed embarrassed but the staff have poor customer service skills.nnalso i believe. that they substitute greens without informing to the customer.once i ordered romaine and believe; i goｔ iceberg.same thing when i ordered butter lettuc e.if you want }eal greens ask for spinach or the mixed greens.nni admire the effort to open a healthy restaurant in south phoenix.i wish this place was managed better...

neg	i had visited this comic book shop it was honest to god my first and (final) time in this store.i had walked in with my video camera which i was filming for a documentary and had moved here from california recently.not even less than a moment of being in there.i barely had walked in until i was confronted by the manager who was hostile and aggressive when approached.he had asked of me what the purpose was that i was filming for and responded to him letting him know i then had asked of him if it was alright with his permission for me to film in there.he then had said to me its too late? now to ask i was not allowed to film in there because i was not granted permission from him to do so.those were his exact words.this is the most venoｍous and vile customer service ive encountered.after he realized who i was and that i had a celebrity status he [late]r had changed his tone of voice and attitude.nive let him know i would have approached him to ask him for his permission if only had i known to my "knowledge" that he was one of the owners there who had operated the shop common sense and logic would have told you you are supposed to have an employee i.d at least a lanyard around youre neck to identify you are an official worker there or a badge.otherwise i had an impression that he was just another customer in there.i did not appreciate the hostile attitude towards me and inflicted at me.i had given them a 📞 la ter that evening and addressed myself more in depth and all they could manage to do was constantly apologize and [invite] me back into their storefront.ive let them know this was the .inal time i was ever to step foot in their business again.nin conclusion to this my final decision is never to conduct my business with them again and strongly advise anyone else to be leary and avoid them like a plague.nthere is an old expression both actually.nyoure customers are always right and once [it "twice" shy

pos	while this may not be as scenic as old port or have as many /ttractions this is a great- place for a walk jog or bike ride.there is a bike path that goes around the entire (canal) and the its not on the 🛣 either my.its actually a path and trail away from the cars and near the water so you can bike at a leisurely pacⅇ.in addition along most of the c>nal is green spaⅽe so if you are 😪 you can {sit} on the grass or bench and have a nice little picnic along the water.nnall in all maybe not an attraction for everyone but its a "great" escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.
neg	being that you are in las vegas you know you want one of those big long tall cups to walk around the strip and the casino drinking away your alcoholic beverage ready to give some life to the night.i was suckeᑯ into creating this momento in my last las vegas visit.i should have asked and checked yelp first but i didnt if i did i might not have purchased the big chill drink... here are my reasons whynn1.i was totally surprised to see that there was no line to place an order here so i was pretty excited about that.there was only one person working behind the bar and he was very unapproachable.i asked if i was able to taste the flavors prior to purchasing my drink and he said yes so i did.i asked him for his favorites tasted those and the ones i wanted to try as well.he never in the whole time that i was there smiled at me or eve n bother having small talk... kinda sad.i did not like that at all.nn2.no discounted dont refills with this being said you will be stuck with a giant cup that just maybe... maybe be able to reuse for like a piggy bank or something.it was pretty lame.i end ed up reusing it with my own booze (though) and then tossed it.fat tuesday though wheres does give you the refills for a discounted hes price.nn3.light alcohol flavor... i like the taste of alcohol what can i say!... unfortunately this drink was light for my taste but not overly sweet so that was a good where's thing.i paid about 17 bucks for my big chill drink my flavor was the blue ice for maybe two shots of vodka in it.i guess you can say- it was about 8 dollars a shot.this is basically a slurpee with a few shots of booze that will lead to a brain freeze here and there.the husband had a few sips himself and kept mixing the drink around thinking that the alcohol was sitting at the bottom..to his taste the alcohol was well mixed in there and he could still taste it.nnnlocation in the monte carlo hotel and casino near a starbucks right when you are gonna go catch the tram to hit up aria and the crystal each shops.nnone star for an ok tasty slurpee drink and the convenient location.

neg	h🇺🇸band and i came here for our anniversary we had the groupon for 2 meals and a bottle of rose... the menu seemed rather small and there wasnt many choices to pick from.i had the steak frites and h🇺🇸band had the chicken.the fries were delicio🇺🇸 but the steak was bland.it had no flavor was pink in the middle eveո though i specifically said i wanted it well and our waiter was really attentive and kept checking up on 🇺🇸... which was nice but annoying at the same ⏳.can i at least attempt to enjoy my crappy steak without being ⍳nterrupted every wont few minutes. my h🇺🇸band ate half of his chicken and said it was gross so he was done... i tried you it out sure enough it was too moist... almost as if it wasnt cooked all the way.rose was an interesting wine but from now on i j🇺🇸t need to stick to my moscato.maybe im j🇺🇸t too picky who knows.i j🇺🇸t wasnt impressed.the prices were j🇺🇸t too high and the food just wasnt worth it.i honestly would never in a million years pay full price for what we ate it j🇺🇸t wasnt that great.definitely wish we would have j🇺🇸t went to outbacks steakhouse.nnhowever the view was amazing.the atmosphere and decorations were really nice and the staff were friendly.nnfor those of you with groupons that want to come here... if you want to order a meal thats more than the 32 allowed they only take off 16 from that meal instead of 32... makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.the por k cost 34... you would think that if i had ordered that id only have to pay 2 more right wrong that pork would have costed 18.this whole thing makes no sense to me.
pos	like every; restaurant in the cosmopolitan even the cosmo itself comme ca is artfully? presented and beautiful to sit in and look at.theres outdoor seating overlooking the strꭵp and the right amount of lighting to take the strip in.the noise level is moderate and a nice break from the general din in lv.nnas a californian i found the seared foie g'as heavenly so heavenly that i had two of them.the glazed onion alongside was wonderful with the duck confit in a crisp wrap.the steak tartare is wonderfully seasoned and perfect on the grilled bread.before that i go through a dozen kumamoto o}sters.nnive also; had brunch here there are good offerings.i did go the healthy route theres and enjoyed their oatmeal.nnservice is attentive casual and friendly.the offer a good wine list and will probably make or bring whatever youd like to have if you asked for it.
neg	t^rrible experience my h🇺🇸band and i boug\t a groupon for 4d ultrasound for this office.they 🇺🇸ually run about 100.00 so we were excited to have gotten such a deal at 35.00.we were called in from the lobby almost an hour late which i understand some ⏳s offices can get behind.the 🇺🇸 tech rushed us through our appointment.she had no bedside manner and was very brash in her t1⃣.she was jabbing the 🇺🇸 probe into my belly very hard and did not once attempt to find another angle.she spoke negatively the entire ⏳ and blamed the babies behavior for her not being able to get a decent picture.as i was about to complain how she was so rough with the 🇺🇸 probe the appointment was over.it lasted about 7 mɪnutes.we left with a 💿 2⃣ printed pictures and a sheet of photos printed from the 🇺🇸 machine.we got 1⃣ decent picture.the rest are very blurry.my h🇺🇸band and i were very disappointed and frustrated.what should have been a nice ⏳ for our family was instead a joke.i went to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager and the lady said she would call some1⃣ but no one came.my h🇺🇸band was so angry that he just wanted to leave.on our way out we noticed another disappointed couple outside.these were the people had that g1⃣ in ahead of 🇺🇸.this was a really bad experience that i will be sure to share with as many people as people.
pos	when my wife and i walked in we looked around and viewed a site that made our eyes perk and our mouths water.d'signed in a mode that is cool eclectic and visualyou are taken on a quick pace to your table.once seated the menu challenge begins.i say that because of its (iversity and taking the time to decide what you really }ant to order.nnscanning the menuwe both made our own decisions on what to try.my wife ordered the heart and seoul 🍔.it is laden with a variety of items avocado kimchi onion strings a f＊rm fresh fried egg and furikakewasabimayo with its ground angus marinated in sriracha and soy sauces.i always having a traditional 🍔 desire received their standard angus burger which had lettuce tomato onion and louie sauce.both 🍔s had brioche buns with the name i love burgers implanted in them.nnhaving been to vancouver and enjoyed them we asked for poutine fries.these are a delight within their own.golden french fries covered with brown gravy mushrooms and carmelized onions could have been a meal unto itself we asked them to leave the cheese off since i am lactose intolerant.nnfor dessert we had a piece of lavish chocolate fudge cake that ended our meal on a high sumptuous peaknnsummary the 🍔s were truly a pure delight my wife never once 🙅ped eating hers and enjoyed every element of it.mine was one that could always be used to show how a traditional american ham🍔 should be cooked and created.i want this to compliment their manager mark for coming to check and see how things were going * and our waitress ashley who made sure everything was in place.nnas a 🍔 buff i can say if you love burgers you will love i love burgers.the food quality service and environment makes this a 🙅 you will always "want" to hang out at when heading to vegas unlike gamblingevery dollar you spend here guarantees to make you a culinary winner
pos	i want to preface this review by saying that im close friends with one of the sushi chefs in training so we ƍot a seat right at the sushi bar and really 'll had a great opportunity to chat.that being said i will review this strictly on the quality of food since we received some deep discounts due to being vip guests.cmon now you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staffchefs so quit your whininnnthe quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi ive had in my existence.the key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef and ask them what is fresh and what they would suggest omakase style.nnwe had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue [fin] yellow tail otoro yes the good stuff and a few other pieces.served with fresh wasabi root not the hydrated 🍵 powdery stuff this appetizer really doesnt woke our stomachs and senses.nnwe had a few different rolls per the chefs suggestion and all were spectacular including some off the menu rolls.the kim bap roll was highly recommended and the quality was defi％itely memorable better than most koreanmom- kim bop rolls ive had in my life.nnwe asked for amaebi sweet shrimp which was soft tender and sweet with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.this was the first time ive had such perfectly made amaebi and its made me want to continue my search in chicago.nnsome tasty mochi desserts a few bottle of sake and all in all it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and i. nnim sorry for those that have found a bad experience at otaku as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic my advice of to you is thisnn1.dont ask for a table if youre party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter because thats how sushi is meant to be served.getting to know your chef the chef getting to know you having drinks together etc. nn2.ask the chef what heshe themselves recommends.not all fish are equally fresh and the chef will know whats best for the day.and if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you likeddidnt like theyll likely craft ours a sushi experience for you that youll love.nnverdict if only otaku were in chicago... i might go broke.delicious sushi and worth a visit

pos	i loved the food here more than my companions d🆔 but one thing we all agreed on was that whoever designed this place was bloody insane.ok they have this nonironic crap 80s music playing and these weird little uniforms, on the staff and the fugliest wa'l decoration as photos of food wrapped up in clothes.npicture a shiitake mushroom leaning up against a highheeled shoe that sort of {thing}.bogus.noh yeah 🆔 definitely come aren't back for the chow but id wear blinders youve and ear plugs.

pos	💘 how they have preset portions scooped out in mini pots that you can grab.its a perfect size not too much and just enough to taste which is what all buffet goers want a taste of everything without being full from grabbing too much in the beginning.this buffet is s mart they are saving tons of money from those that grab too much and end up wasting a plateful of food.nncame here for lunch on a weekday no line 23.nni will have to say that some of the aƽian dishes were not that great.this may be biased since i am [asian couldnt] and know what it should taste like but i think anyone would agree.the hai gaw dim sum shrimp dumpling was dry and crumbly like it was not steamed.the chicken adobe was dry and not edible.nncouldnt try everything but dishes that stood out were the curriеs salads and desserts between.nnthere is a wonderful array of desserts } displayed in all colors so pretty and tastes just as pretty as it looks the desserts saved me from those horrible tasting 'm asian i'd their dishes.nnservice was good.als೦ 💘d how the water we get is served in this clean fresh looking bottleit tasted good too not like tap water.
neg	we ate there tonight after reading all the yelp reviews.we were trying to find something better and different- than our regular bellagio.i was a bit disappointed because most of the items written about and pictured here were not offered.im not sure if a limited menu was offered because it was a weeknight.weeknight and weekend night prices are the same 35 so the menus should be comparable.i was really looking forward to some items other yelp reviewers enjoyed.some of the items i noticed were missing from the buffet included pad thai sesame chicken mussels pork buns although the gu y told me it was a morning menu item tacos al pastor macarons i dont care for them but i know many people love them and they were missing from the buffet the little painted egg shell dessert cups fried chicken sweet potato fries mac n cheese bar chicken apple sausagℯ kalbi head on shrimp really wanted this one and many others.in fact i didnｔ think there was anything on the menu worth the 35.the best items were the corn on the cob with cilantro butter and the watermelon wfeta.i still feel the bellagio buffet with the chilean sea bass he's is a better deal.plus bellagio serves several more expensive buffet items and provides a nicer variety.nni was also pretty annoyed by all the individual ｄishes and pans.the pans were bulky and heavy to carry.at a buffet i often like to take just a spoonful of a dish to try before fully committing.many of the dishes: were too much of a commitment.i wanted to try the pappardelle but i ⅾidnt want to take a whole pot of it.the tables were also too small for so many disheƽ.to give the staff credit they did a great job clearing the tables.while trying to juggle and arrange everything on the table i dropped my fork and our server came right over to replace it.the bottle of water at the table was nice but it was poured into a tiny glass with no ice.its ％ugust in vegas and i wanted cold water.after refusing the bottle of wine i was surprise the bottle was left on the tiny table taking up precious table real estate.nnwe wanted to try something new this time around.we usually eat at an on strip buffet at least once while we visit vegas because its not a trip to vegas without a vegas buffet.our other me als are usually is off the strip.we initially wanted to try the wynn buffet because weve never tried it but went with wicked spoon instead.ive eaten at studio b spices lago carnival village seafood le village and bellagio.it seems like i eat at bellagio at least once every time im in vegas.i just ate there two weeks ago when i was last here.we dont always eat at buffets.i had a great meal at social house in the crystals shopping center and had a great hot dog at pinks during my last visit but buffets always seems to be the easiest meal option when youre with a larger group or with a picky eater.i dont eat nearly enough to make buffets worth the price.but i do try to make up for it by eating the more expensive items like seafood or duck.nnthe buffet it not terrible but not great.
pos	we paid 44 per person for dinner.nnhonestly i really d islike buff ets.nothing e.er really wows me or makes me mouth 💧 so for me to find even one food item that i actually like is surprising.at wicked spoon i found three.nnmission fiｇs blue cheese and candied baconnwild 🐗 sloppy joenduck raviolinni really dont like bacon and blue cheese but man the f igs so impeccably sweet tangy and salty with a bite.amazing i could probably gor ge myself on just this.nnwild 🐗 sloppy joe it had an interesting flavor that i cant really describe only it was pulled meat and ohsogood.nnduck raviolo again really interesting flavor.i really liked it though.it was extremely creamy and flavorful.nnthese three items alone would make me come here again.buffets . never why's really make me happy or excited except maybe this one.as long as they had these items forever 'm.
neg	i dont return know what all the hype is about but im guessing it was for dinne r because sunday brunch sucked definitely not worth the 35 dollars.nnyayndesserts cheesecake gelato rice pudding carrot cake and the strawberries from the chocolate covered strawberries were all the things i liked from this buffet.nyou have the option of paying 10 extra for champagne brunch which was nice.nnnaynfood why is everything so salty im surprised no one is tasting the food before it comes out.after i was done eating my tongue felt sore from the abrasiveness of all the salty food.nvariety they dont have that many.there was an abundance of pork though.bacon sausage. breakfast sausage and sausage patties he'll and andouille roasted pork at chinese 5 spiceskin was not crispy chinese pork ribs and at the carving stationpork belly bacon was really tough and roasted pork ribs.they had a small section of asian foodeverything was bleh or too salty spanishitalian foods a large breakfast station a breakfast omelette station a make your own cereal station salad bar dessert and the only soup being offered was a miso soup and guess what yes thats salty as well.ncarving station i guess its my fault for not asking about what was being served before i waited in line but there was no prime rib im just so used to all the buffets in vegas : offering it but this was a huge disappointment.the only thing they had were roasted chicken top sirloin bone marrow and roast pig.i liked that they had bone marrow but the toast that was served with it and the chiｍichurri was salty ugh it had like a strong garlic salt taste to itnthe guy at the carving station was very inattentive.didnt seem like he wanted to be there.a customer asked for a ѕlice of prime rib and he gave him a slice of top sirloin.didnt even try to correct him and say that it wasnt prime rib.maybe he didnt hear him but like i said very inattentive.i had to wave him down once because he was staring off somewhere else.nni definitely regret coming here for brunch.
neg	easily one of the most over priced buffets in veg's due to the quality of fooⅾ and service.f⍥od was no bueno best thing this place has was the shrimp cocktail.[desserts] offered were okay nothing special.service was teᴦrible plates were not cleared wasnｔ busy or anything took 15 minutes to get our drinks and they brouƍht out the wrong drinks.maybe they were having a bad night i donｔ know if i would come back.
neg	i we nt to this buffet with three other people and none of us liked it.the buf`et presentation was gr{eat} as stated in pervious- reviews.the actual menu was the problem for me.i dont think i was cult＄red enough to enjoy their offerings.the item that stooᏧ out to me the most was the 🦐 that still had eyes and legs.the dessert was very mediocre and looked better than it tasted.i spent most of my time walking around the ｂuffet with an empty plate because the food was totally different from what i would normally eat.im glad it worked for some but its just not for me
pos	im in love with this place.its just got amazing energy.great music gooｄ although expensive drinks good people gogo dancers crazy light show etc.nni started out with a beer which i believe was 6 and then switched to mixed drinks which were 11.on my second vodka redbul i asked for d⍥uble and the bar tender gave it to me for the same 11 ϱrice as the single so that was sweet.also had a great gin and tonic.service is slow though lots of folks and the bar tenders arent in a rush.they are however pretty nice once they gℯt around to you.the place is filled with chairs and couches but people also kinda ge t up and dance in the empty space although there is no real dance floor.i actually found that somewhat appealing it takes what little formality there is in club dancing and makes it completely casual.most folks were in club attire dressed and button up shirts but there were a few folks dressed down a bit and that didnt seem to be a problem there is no bouncer.the music that night was also super dope.chris cutz a was in from saո diego and absolutely melted faces.right song at the right time every time lots of bass and hard beats:.their sound system in general is of pretty ]ood quality.
pos	the wife was right. ..!this place is quite nice.it was our first night out in vegas on a recent trip.i am not a big fan of the club music designer jean clubs in vegas..꘎so this place was a welcome reprieve.nnit is (hard) not to mⅈss.beautiful chandeliers adorn every square inch of ceiling.there was an awesome band playing܁..stra ight out of the bettie he'd page era.thʋs it seemed to attract a more nondouchy crowd.drinks were high as usual but heavy on the flavor and alcohol.its easy to find a place to sit and enjoy some music without it being too loud.very very cool spot.
pos	it is a 🎩 place.bar tender was atｔentive and concerned about mixing to my taste.althoug h a relatively slow night there was a flow .. of people in and out.¯ood for people watching and striking up a casual "conversation".i hiℊhly recommend it.check: out all 3 floors.
neg	what a disappointment... in ter's of food and service.we also did u00e8 a few months ago so we knew the gin and tonic would be good...which it was with its cool globe shaped ice cube...nnnow food... the only things we thought were really good were the veal checks..very tender and soft..and also the cannelloni noodle with the pork filing..very rich but good.nnthe tomato bread seemed soggy..the croquettes while served in a playful shoe were only ok... the bacalao empanadas were likℯ fried greasy wontons.the asparagus was tender but only tasty if u dipped it in the sauce it came with which wasnt enough togo around.we had a sam?le of the "obster paella ... the rice was dry and tasteless lobster was overdone... so glad we didnt order it.nnnow service...there was some major disconneⅽt between the server and other servers as well as with us..moreso than i have ever seen before at a restaurant.nour first round of ordering i ordered a dish that never came..so when we asked about he he was lⅈke oh i wasnt sure if you wanted me to put it in... then when we said yeah..we do..he was like oh actually well the chef wasnt happy with this dish tonight so we suggest you try another dish similar to that....ok....but it was weird he never told us this.nnnext time he said we have lobster yourselves paella now but later they are making shortrib paella.we said we would |ike the short rib paella when it comes out..and then ordered some other dishes.meanwhile a waitress comes by 15 min later with a plate and says the waiter said you were interested in the paella so here is a sample her of the lobste, paella.we tasted it and thought meh glad we ordered the shortrib cuz this isnt that good.meanwhile other small plates come out and we said oh is the short rib paella coming still.then he was lik e all oh i wasnt sure if you wanted it and we were like yeah we ordered the shortrib... hes like oh but didnt the waitress give you a ꮪample.we were very confused..he said oh the chefs decid'd to go with |obster all night and not do the short rib... ok....why didnt you tell us this when we clearly ordered it nnso much did confusion... so awkward... and so overpriced.the dishes were not that well execut ed and staff seemed not wellmeshed.i thought maybe when we were seated at the bar before our reservation at u00e8 that it was awkward that they forgot about us and we got seated to u00e9 late even though we were very early..but apparently staff disc onnect is a common theme here....
pos	my girlfriend and i decided to swing on in and try this place out on a whim.you wouldnt expect to find this lonely eatery among the few remaining establishments scattered along a longvacated row of storefronts it shares in this oncethriving strip mall but there it is nnand thank the heavens wouldnt that this little gem has managed to ride out the last few years financial turmoil and still be there to deliver good food at good prices to good people.maybe thats the real reason theyre still aroundnninside you are welcomed by a split dining ro&m that is sparsely adorned and clearly outdated with a spattering of yooperuppermichigan paraphenalia hung about but that helps to reinforce the relaxed and comfortable attitude both the staff and menu display.nnits obⅴious that this establishment thrives on the elderlyoriented business from the various mobile home parks assistedliving homes! and retirement communities surrounding it.winter packs this place tight with snow birds at meal times however red mountain cafe has something for everyone and the wait is never unreasonable.my girlfriend and i are spirited young adults and even we found it to be a place we can relate to.nnthe menu is classic american comfort food all the way.totally an eggs n bacon for breakfast sandwiches and burgers for lunch type of affair with a few americanized mexican efforts tossed in but not recommended.this is where postgame golfers go to lounge with a refreshing coke in hand and debate whether coleslaw is more american than 🥔 salad while they both share a basket of sweet potato fries nnall the food we have tried aside from the chimichanga has been decent.the philly cheesesteak one of my favorite items on the menu isnt what id call entirely authentic but its a darn tastʏ interpretation using thick cuts of fresh roast beef and a buttered toasted hoagie bunnnprices are very reasonable.both thirdpound and halfpound burgers are available for the hungry and the hungrier.both the burgers and the decentlysized sandwiches not huge but filling and (tasty) range from 47.most menu items outside of breakfast come with at least one generous side with primary choices being coleslaw 🥔 salad french fries or a side salad.various specials are posted on a board! as you walk in and there is a soupoftheday available as well.nnthe quality of the ingredients is excellent and the taste of all items we have tried has been very good.this isnt worldclass dining by a long stretch but better than the dennys alternative service is what youd expect from a place where regulars are referred to by name those and the overall value for your money and time is highnnif you can take a few minutes out of your day to enjoy this easygoing diner with horrible decor i know youll just love it
neg	overall disappointed.the portion sizes were terrible for the price and the bartender since we sat at the bar failed to tell us that the dish we ordered and appetizer would not be enough for a lunch for two.we ordered the pigs on horseback due to its hype.they were definitely the best thing we had though they were on the dry side and lacked something i think a crisp vinegar style dipping been sauce could have easily fixed.we also ordered the beijing glass noodles which promised to be a light vegetarian dish to compliment our heavy pork break appetizer.the noodles came out and the whole dish was a little larger than my fist.more of a side really.it seem ed liｋe they had marinated everything in sesame oil and had little other 'lavor.since we were still hungry we ordered a couple of t acos thinking the other side of the menu would be good.wrong.the ti nga poblano was really flavor myless and the cochinita was even worse.the pork had a bӏand dippedina1 taste and the onions didnt add anything to the dish other than filler that distracted me from the taco.the service was terrible.our bartender was attentive to our waters but failed to 🆘 us decide anything and generally acted aloof and a bit shady.the decor was enjoyable and the idea i think is awesome.i really hope they step their game up.probably the worst restaurant to eat at in the cosmo.i will not be returning.
neg	we went there for our anniversary last week.nnmy husband o rdered the complete tasting menu with wine pairing and i ordered the 3 course tasting menu.nnthe service was horrible.starving they made me wait 1 hour for my first appetizer and 1 hour and 12 it's for the second which they made a mistake by serving me my husbands order it was a mini portion of a cooked fish with the 🔝 being cooked but the inside totally raw i mean if we wanted sashimi we would go to a sushi restaurant there's why would we pay 400 for tasting menu when they cant even couldn't cook a piece of fish.so in 2 [hours] and ~2 i pretty much had 1 appetizer and 1 cocktail.nnon 🔝 of the awful food for my husbands second dish the waiter served him his wine 30 minuteꜱ before they served him his dish so by the time he got anything to eat the wine was already finished and we were told no refil ls.for his third dish he got the food 30 minutes! before they served him his wine so by the time my husband received his wine for his wine pairing he was already done eating.nnit was truly a horrible experience.nni was really starving.we were seated at 630pm and furiously left the restaur ant by 9pm.in 2 hou's 1Ƨ ive had 1 appetizer and my husband had 3 courses of his 6 course tasting menu with 1 of the 3 being raw.nnwhat else can i say about this restaurant eachnnwe did not expect to get this low standard of service and food for this type of restaurant.it was really disapointing.

pos	sometimes i j🇺🇸t like to go out drink dance and i nteract with strangers all while getting my ear drums assaulted by what can only be described as nasty bass drops.yes sometimes i like to go to ♣.and tao group has almost never failed me in my clubgoing experi ences and marquee was no different.nnthe first time i went was a brief walk through essentiallywent with a frie nd who does not handle enclosed: crowded spaces well.yeah.i know.so after a quick walk through we left? and i figured id never be back beca🇺🇸e while nothing displeased me at the club i really only go if im guaranteed seating and a place to hide the heels that ive kicked off.nnnearly a year later came back for my best frie%ds birthday and she had a table bingo so i got to stay play and e xperience.i honestly dont know where we were in the club j🇺🇸t at a table near one of the bars but we could see a lot of the dance floor action and had a decent view of the djs stage.what i liked about marquee mostly had to do with service.typically when you get a compd table particularly with all girls service is pretty subpar there are other words i could 🇺🇸e... because the busser and hostess make an unfortunate assumption that a table of girls is not going to tip well.our hostess did not do thatshe was so nice came back to check on 🇺🇸 frequently and didnt treat, us like second class citizens.even if she didnt want to be bothered with 🇺🇸 she never showed it.so we left her a fat tip.its very simple dont be a bitch and well leave a good tip.nnthe m🇺🇸ic was great the dj was fun and someone threw a whole bunch of dollar bills onto the dance floorso all in all a great e₤perience.not sure i would come back without a table beca🇺🇸e of personal preference but would recommend marquee for an authentic vegas nightclub experience!.

pos	in theory i love marquee... in reality not so much.nnthe good 3 stars the club is huge with 3 floors each housing their own genre of music.its a beautiful ?! space without a doubt.theres an inside and outside to cool down when it gets too hot inside there are great views of the strip outside and every1⃣ is dressed to the nines because its a tier1 club in vegas.theres worldclass talent multiple nights a week spinning here but if youre not an edm kind was of person theres also a hip hop floor and top 40.that being said...nnthe bad 2 stars what ki·d of idiotic structural desi gner made a club where girls need to walk updown 5 flights of stairs to get in that part never made sense to me.i love my leg workouts but hobbling down 5 stories in 5 inch heels after a night of dancing gets... well it gets fucking annoying.to get from 1⃣ floor to the other is a massive shitshow when youre drunk and the layout of the club makes it impossible to find anyone.i found the nightclub to be a nightmare to navigate every single time ive come here.the circular labyrinth layout makes it easier to find in waldo in a sea of patriotic colors than a damn bathroom to relieve myself in because the club looks the same from every angle the stairs too which really doesnt help when youre trying to figure out which floor youre on.and youd think that for a club inside the cosmo and with so much clout and real estate space theyve make a bigger main dancefloor.if youre not on the main dancefloor by 11pm youre not getting on it for the rest of the night unless you tip the bouncer a 50.nnthe other good that i readded a star for secret pizza.this amazing pizzeria is inside the cosmo and when you see every1⃣ exiting marquee and making their way there follow them its got to be the best drunk food ive ever had.nnmarquee was one of those ♣ i wanted to love because the concept is great multiple floors insideoutside great djs different genres goodlooking crowd etc. but couldnt because some design er totally cut out the practical aspect of his work.i can usually only stand being here for an hour or two before he ading over to wynn and encore to finish my night.anyways...nndayclub that got another star in my opinion a lot better than the nightclub part of marquee.theres less people the heat gets you drunk faster every1⃣ looks their best in the summer servers are friendly and its not insanely hard to get a drink.i was fro®t and center for dash berlin when he played here.i still think encore beach club is more fun but marquee is definitely among the best day♣ you can go to in vegas.

pos	this was a strange review to write as the food is top notch and deserves five stars.the only reason i gave it four was due to two issues that will be irrelevant to some people.first the cheapest bottle of red wine was 70 which i think is ridiculous.i dont think its asking too much to have a 50 bottle of wine on your menu.i like wine with food but am not a connoisseur so the difference between a 50 bottle and a 100 bottle is nil to me.second youre much better served going with a group of four or larger.sides and appetiz?rs state they serve two to four and they are huge and way too large for two people.you will also have far more seafood options if you are ordering for more than two people as the seafood bar more to come later selections are usually two 💷s or more.nnon to the food...amazing.your server will take you to what is essentially a seafood market inside of the restaurant.there is a large bed of ice on which are laid their seafood selections for the evening.each selection has a small sign which indicates the name of the selection and the price pe£ 💷.most were in the 50lb.range.we had originally ordered a mediterranean sea bass but it was only available at two lbs.or larger so she recommended a similar selection that i can neither remember nor prono·nce at a 💷 and a half.two lbs.would have been far too large for the two of us and we were not interested in leftovers.the seafood was so fresh and simply prepared.it was grilled lightly seasoned and topped with a (little) oil.they let the seafood be the star and it is incredible.our appetiꮓer was the s£reads which included tzatziki hummus tarmosalata and fava.it was great but it was so large we maybe ate a third of it at most as we didnt want to fill up on an appeti!er.with the seafood we also ordered a side of their grilled pep;ers.again great but a huge portion and over half of it was uneaten.outstanding meal all the way around but paid for a good amount of food we couldnt eat.also its pretty! amazing that all the fresh seafood can be on ice in the middle of the restaurant and yet no fishy smell.
pos	review is for restaurant week fall 2012 menunnthis was a four course meal with no choice for each of the courses.nncourse 1 carpaccio of m(diterranean caught 🐟 with fresh herbs citrus afrala sea salt and extra virgin olive oil.the 🐟 was so delicate and so tasty.the olive oil and the salt made the dish.it was very good.nncourse 2 grilled octopus with roasted peppers and assorted grilled mushrooms.another winner of a dish.the octopus was so tasty and the mushrooms were very good.nncourse 3 grilled mediterranea n sea bass.it was the whole 🐟 with the head ✂ off and placed to the left of the opened fish.the server cautioned me about avoiding the collar bones which were attached to the meat.a very tasty 🐟 perfectly cooked; to preserve its moistness.nncourse 4 greek walnut cake with kaimaki ice cream.very tasty cake and flavorful ice cream.nnthe meal came with a basked of bread2 slices in my casei was [dining] alone.there was a small dish into which the server poured olive oil for dipping the bread.nni really like the room.the decor is very nice that id like to call modern rustic.the lights have small filaments in a twist formation that give off a pleasant glow.the furniture is modern.nnservice was quite good given that there was a party of about 20 people that came about 10 ｍinutes after me and they took a lot of time.nna few things keep this from getting 5 stars.between the second and third course the waiter removed my bread and olive oil.as he was doing it he said youre done with the bread right i was so surprised by his question and his taking that i just shook my head in agreement.maybe he thought i had eaten the main course and would soon have dessert.maybe i should have jammed a fork into his hand if i had one.hed already taken that.nnthere were several small bones in the main part of the 🐟.i could just imagine being a judge on chopped and having my say about that.very surprising.nnlast i wish theyd shut the door to the outside.it was saturday night and not too far from the entrance are some table games at the cosmopolitan.theres also a lot of foot traffic out there of 20 somethings whod spent part of the day at the poolnot just swimming and ogling the ladiesbut also indulging in the spirits of their choice.they were loud and it carried into the restaurant.close the door.nn] am a (fan) of milos.i will return and i think ill do so for their lunch special.it should be quieter too

pos	vegas just wouldnt be the same for me [without] multiple visits to secret pizza its been a good two years since my last trip to sin city and im proud to say that its still the real deal i took a girlfriend here with me on our first night and at 3 am it was still open and still in the same spot on the 4th floor of the cosmo..she marveled at how theres no signage no listing and i replied thats why its a secret lol even at 3аm theres a long line? but thankfully everything moves pretty quickly.true to vegas party scene everyone in line off with us was pretty much wasted and the folks behind us were obnoxiously drunk.nnwe finally got to the front and the pizza guy chit chatted with us about what slices they were offering at that time.i honestly marvel at how "nice" everyone is at secret pizza because if i had to deal with all the tomfoolery i dont think 🆔 be nearly as patient.we each got two slices and a coke to go.the prices have gone up from 3.50 to 4.75 per slice with an additional .50 per topping.still not so bａd when you cons🆔er that youre in a very touristy area and it is Ꝫam.nnoverall still a really great experience and literally a h🆔den gem on the las vegas strip.we came 🔙 the next night again for secret pizza as we were hanging out at the bar and my girlfriend came back a third time the next night because she wanted to make sure she got another slice before we headed back home now that is some gooooood pizza folks may you be very lucky during your trip to vegas and may your stomach be blessed with the deliciousness of secret pizza
pos	my meal and ex(erience at blue ribbon featured the best sushi sashimi and other japanese fare that i have had yet six of us ventured to the restau rant with our friend and veteran sushi chef and through his connections dishes were selected and brought to us strategically rather than ordering off the menu.nnwe began with a 👫 plates of fresh delicious meltinyourmouth hamachi yellowtail sashimi dosed in a light soy sauce based dressing and topped with thin "lices of jalapeu00f1o and perfectly seared ahi tuna in its own tantalizing sauce tossed with fresh scallions and mixed greens on the side.nnnext was the highlight of our night the blue ribbon special.a twofoot wooden platter decorated with carefullycarved fish skeletons and intricate cucumber designs was filled with an extravagant variety of specialty sashimi and rolls.this included raw uni sea urchin on a bed of lemon slices not in its own casing a pile of lightly marinated raw jellyfish spicy crab rolls roses made of wild tuna he's sashimi madai japanese red snapper sashimi and sake salmon sashimi thin slices of sawara spanish mackerel sashimi lined along its own skeleton the blue ribbon special roll with 12 lobster shiso and black caviar the dragon special roll with avocado eel and radish sprouts and finally hirame fluke sashimi with its skeleton.everything was extremely fresh delicious and simply amazing.nnto add to an already overthetop meal the chef brought us the karai :se ebi roll spicy lobster in an egg wrapper topped with black caviar and unagi fresh water eel nigiri.then kobe beef tartare carefully topped with fresh scallions and egg yolk and their version of fried chicken that you dip in a tasty wasabi honey sauce.i finished the meal with a 👫 of the best spicy ％una salmon and yellowtail hand rolls i"e ever had.nntheir fresh and decadent desserts didnt disappoint either.ginger bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and candied yuzu amazing green tea azuki bean and mandarin orange mochi ice cream and lastly flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream best tasting gt ice cream ha nds down.nnwhen it comes to freshness creativity and attention to detail blue ribbon is arguably the best sushi restaurant the in town.the only con is certainly its price tag our whole meal with a few drinks and a cold bottle of sake sales tax and very generous gratuity was approximately 1000 for six.if youre dining as a 👫 the blue ribbon special platter will be all you need for a satisfying meal and it could even stretch to comfortably feed four.that being said its a toss whether or not the food and dining exp erience is worth the cost however i would definitely love an encore.

pos	i had a greaｔ experience here.in my trip to vegas i loved being able- to get a {great} 🍵 at 1am.our server jesse was very accommodating and on his job.the atmosphere in the cosmopolitan was awesome cool lighting design and the 🇩🇯 was playing some smooth mix es.ռni had the the henry 🍵 with avocado and sourdough bread.hot ☕ to balance out all my beer drinking.i cant wait to come back next time im in laꮪ vegas.
neg	on my last visit to las vegas i had breakfast at the henry on two separate occasions hows.the henry has been a regular breakfast stop every time id stayed at the cosmopolitan.it had been up until now a model of consistency given its highend 24hour casino diner status.however both visits on this trip provided wildly different experiences which also offered two distinct data points indicating that things are amiss at the henry.nnfirst good consistent service has noticeably slipped.on saturday morning around 11am with a party of six our service was fast friendly and attentive.on tuesday morning around 10am # service was largely awol as it took over 25 minutes for our breakfasts to come out after placing our orders with no interim stops at our table by our server to check up on us or to explainapologize for the excessive wait for our foo％.second the fo੦d quality execution they and portion sizes have nosedived.i had the short r®b benedict 19 on saturday.while it was still a tender flavorful and savory hunk of meat it was noticeably a much smaller portion than id received on previous trips to the henry.the short rib ... isnt served atop an english muffin but insteαd a potato hash.however this time the hash was desiccated crispy flavorless and not very appetizing.it wasnt a good result for this previously awesome dish.on tuesday i had the breakfast burrito 16.it too was noticeably smaller than i remembered.more damning was that after the excessive wait to get it the burrito was only warm not hot and seemingly soggy and limp.it had likely sat around for a while before being brought out to me.however the ultimate failure was that i bit into a foreign object an inchlong sliver of clear plastic found in the center of my burrito.while the server did the right and only thing and took my burrito of our bⅈll it was real ly too late to recover from an awful experience.at least the illy coffee that they serve was good and hot on both visits.nneveryone has an off day.that said the slippage at the henry is painfully apparent.while i will stay at the cosmopolitan again the same cant be said about a return visit to the henry.
pos	id keep going 🔙 just for the sweet potato chips and the patio diniոg.its a perfect place for lunch.2⃣ can share many of the 'enu items.we loved the pear and gorgonzola flat whysbread.the service and the orange blossom iced 🍵 helped provide an upbeat atmosphere.nnim eager to tr y some of the other flat. breads as well as the smoked t,out beignets the white bean chili and some of the salads.dont pass this up if you are in downtown scottsdale.
pos	the 🌿 box is good. nnfor brunch the salmon hash is an aweso'e combination of wonderful breakfast քoods.i especi@lly (liked) that it had the fingerling potatoes mixed in.but really you can put potatoes in anything and ill like it.nntoday i had lunch at the 🌿 box and was pleasantly surprised with their fish 🌮 )pecial.seriously i didnt expect 🌮s this good at a place with such varied food styles as the 🌿 box.nnwhat keeps me from giving the 🌿 box that final star are the prices and service.the food is good but just a few bucks more than what i usually want to spend.the service isnt awful but it has that slightly snobbish scottsdale vibe.little tᏂings like that make me want to stay in central phoenix and out of downtown scottsdale.

neg	do not buy anything from this companynnsure they are nice and friendly when they are trying to get your business then afterwards Ьeware nnfirst they state no credit check on their store windows but when you go to apply in order to get approved you have to show a mountain of paperwork then after all of that they dont approve you for the full amount of purchase so you still have to come out of pocket with cash.they also charge a 45 application fee approved or not.then i had to pick out another table cause whom they couldnt finance me for what i wanted so they had to do different paperwork and if teri isnt there those salesmen are lost and have no clue what is going on.then they never gave me a copy of the second invoice showing the cash i paid.a red flag should have gon© up the minute i walked into that store and saw the mountain of paperwork of orders and a computer that looks like 1989 is waiting for it to come home.nni purchased a dinging room table with 6 chairs from them.they delivered it and set it up.after they left went to put chairs aroᴜnd the table two chairs do not fit on one side cause its the width of the two chairs combined are wider than the table allows where the legs are.second the chairs have been loose when one broke only a few weeks after i had the table they told me to bring it in for replacement or repair which i did and almost two months later and several phone calls later i still have not received the chair 🔙.the other night i was sitting at the table doing an online college course i got up to get a drink of water went to sit 🔙 down and before i know it i was on the flooᴦ the chair completely broke underneath me and i called them to ask about getting my money back and she told me to email her a copy of my invoice and when she replied she said that they would fix and tighten the chairs but not return my money or give me a replacement.now why would i go and return more chairs to them if they havent returned the one from over a month ago.do i have stupid written on my forehead so i replied 🔙 to her stating my issues just this evening as i am writing this so i am waiting for a response.but i am seeking other options.nndo not purchase one single item from this storennnthe better business bureau has been notified.nnnnn here is their response from the bbb complaintnncustomer was called to pick up new chair and she has not picked it up yet.customer sent a picture of the damaged chair and the manufacturer decided that the breakage was not normal use.we try to accommodate every customer but if you are leaning 🔙 on your chair and it breaks that is not how a dining chair should be used.nnthis is a bunch of baloney.how can they determine if i was leaning 🔙 in the chair if four of the 6⃣ chairs have something wrong with them.i am currently in the proⅽess of writing my response to the bbb.and i will continue updating this review as i get information.

neg	was visiting edinburgh for a night and the next morning we decided to go for a wander around to find somewhe re to have a decent breakfast.and so we unfortunately came upon loudons.the ordering system was like being in a canteen but with restaurant prices.we were hungry after a great night out in edinburgh though so we decided to persist.i ordered did the eggs benedict don't with ham. or the eggs beni as the staff annoyingly insisted on 📲 it.the amount of food that came out was as small as the abbreviated name.the staff then proceeded to clean up around us as we were ｓtill eati:g the pl)ce wasnt even busy so i dont know why they wanted us out so quickly.nna p lace for people with more money than sense
neg	ok.i was naturally excited about this new burger joint because people kept raving about it.i thought to myself this is something i have to try.i kept trying to drop in on the place before and after movies and the place consistently had at least a 45 minute wait to be seat＊d.so...it took a good lo'g time before i actually got to siｔ down and eat there.nnso did it live up to the hype not at all.nni ordered there most basic burger hoping to taste the quality of the meat and how well it was cooked.just like most red blooded american males im very serious about my bսrgers.i was disgusted with this burger and the fries.note i did not order any special rubs or hoopla of any sorts.i wanted to see what they were ₤orking with.the burger itself was disgustingly sweet.the only thing i could compare such it to was nutmeg.yea a meat patty doused how in nutmeg.it was gross.same for the fries they were also dusted with this foul concoction.it was an unpalatable mess.nnpeople are still raving over it.i dont get it.there are better places to get burger s in the city.nnthe place is straightup unimpressive.
neg	my experience was like the others posted here.went to the mesa location for the first time saturday night.havent really had the urge for changs but i had a gift card to use.sit down... notice how small? the restaruant is compared to the other changs weird.and they sat us at the (little) twoseater in the middle of the room i hate that anyway about 10 mins later no server in sight the manager asked if we have had our drink order taken.we hadnt so he took it by that point we were ready to order and he took that too.he did apologize for the tardy introduction from our server.i used to be a server at the chandler changs so i know what standards this restaruant holds and let me tell you this location doesnt hold up to them.the table had food particles left on it.the chili soy and vinegar bottles had residue on them.hot water and hand soap cleans she's this up real nice when i worked there we had to have clean bottles on our table our server comes by with our drinks sets them down and walks away.dӏdnt even introduce herself we didnt know if she was our server or not.few "minutes" later she comes back and drops off the sauce and mixes it quickly and explains that by adding more chili sauce it will ma ke it hotter....that was it you are supposed to explain what the sauce is and ask your guests how hot they want the sauce and explain what all the sauces mean.or by all means ask them if they have ever been to the restaurant before and by chance you wont have to explain it because your guests already know what it is.she was lacking on the communication.food comes just okay.not the taste i remember from my days of working there which is why i rarely go to changs anymore.very p)icing.kung pao scallops were 17.95 they used to be 12.95 wow crab fried rice was not to my liking.the server assistant out or busser whatever they are called nowdays refilled our drinks but not quickly.he brought us new ones from the kitchen instead of refilling them with the pitcher it was ice tea not sure why... but it took forever.wont bother with this place again.

neg	absolutely disappointed.when your primary product is 🍕 and your menu is fairly limited you need to work hard to set yourself apart the crowd.unfortunately for me grimaldis fell flat on its face from an experience standpoint.while my previous experiences have been average my latest encounter left me regretting my choice.this evening i ordered a 🍕 🇹🇬 which you would think would be a simple uneventful task.not so.my son and i stood waiting for 5 minutes before someone even offered to help us without any other customers waiting ahead of us.then we watched as the manager proceeded to pull each of the 2⃣ girls who were handling take out orders awa y from their job to discuss some errors that had apparently occurred during their shift.mind you this is in the midst of a sunday night take out rush.after the second girl got her talking to i watched as she tried to compose herself unsuccessfully and then proceeded to remove her apron and walk out the door.that left one poor girl to tend the phones and handle the 🇹🇬 traffic since against the manager conveniently decided to disappear to the back of the house after her talks with the togo staff.the remaining girl jumped between calls while 🇹🇬 orders piled aren't up below her counter.i had a sneaking suspicion that one of those 🍕s was mine sin[e i had now been waiting over 25 minutes but i had no chance to ask about it because nobody was around to ask and the one counter girl was jumping from call to call.after waiting another 1520 minutes the girl started checking the 🍕s and just as i had assumed brought me mine from the pile.when i told her that i knew that this 🍕 had already been sitting there for 20 minutes she apologized and offered the lame excuse: that it was very busy tonight.ni have at least 510 other 🍕 places i pass on my w ay to this place and grimaldis just gave me an e©cuse to either try down the others again or give them a first try before i return to this place.
pos	dc au to has a great theyre shop and its really clean great dis play showing what they offer and a nice waiting area with a tv.a huge plus is that they stick to their time estimate every1⃣ is nice and professional and they "make" you the priority when youre in there.ive tinted a lot of cars about 14 over the last 10 years and have had some g<od and bad experiences.1⃣ thing that is great let's is the pricing is laid out on their site so theres no guessing or 📞ing around to a bunch of stores only to get quoted different numbers depending on the timeday you call.although they do have some of the best pricing on their ceramic film.theres a reason they have 5 stars and nice to see reputable shops still exist.ni recently tinted my commuter car 2015 honda fit and went with ceramic on all windows and the &lear nano on the windshield.car was returned clean and will be bringing my suv to get tinted.
neg	wel| the fun contꭵnues with (verizon).that refund that ballooned from 2 weeks to 3 months.their customer service in irvine why california called to apol®gize of course that apology turned my past quote of 5 days to 2 weeks into an additional 4 to 5 weeks.sounds like a sound apology to me.um yes you were told um 2 weeks max but i got on that right away and its only going to be 4 weeks minimum from this point instead if the 2 you were told.isnt that great.hopefully yelp and the 5 consumer advocacy groups i contacted can ｇet the ball rolling or maybe each one will keep adding a month as is tradition in verizon; land.guess my grand 'ids can (et that measly refund sometime in their lifetime.my previous comment about "verizon" being good but not that location i take it 🔙.its a scam.tony soprano would be envious.two cans and a string would be far better than v&rizon and their customer care.

pos	i used yelp reviews to find affordable flooring and i would be remiss to not add to the amazing reviews that they already have.they are amazing from our first experience in the showroom which was informative and friendly they had a very nice can't selection of til e.we were allowed to take several [til/]s with us to see how they fit in with our furnishing and lightⅈng in the house.about a week later we se|ected our ti le and it was a very hard decision.i had several friends come and give me their opinion.once decided we were torn on how much of the first floor to t ile.they were so accommodating to work up several bids with absolutely no pressure.we decided on doing everything but the bedrooms about 1900 sq. feet.we paid a deposit the flooring was ordered and the installation scheduled.when the flooring was delivered it was the wrong tile; we.long story short was that the samp~e we had was mislabeled by the wholesaler we were disappointed to learn that the ｔile i'd we liked was backordered.this is where as one reviewer said affordable flooring is no jok:.they allowed me to choose .. another tilҽ at the same price the loss to be absorbed by the wholesaler.customer seindyddrvice is something they do not sidestep on.we chose a beautiful wood plank ｔile and we could not be happier.everyone that comes in our home comments on it the installers lay the til e carefully and they are artists.they inspected and pulled ti^es that werent squared perfectly.the job took a while and they were polite and congenial.they also had to work around a master bath renovation and they were very willing to come out and do the bathroom a week later than the rest of the floor with no additional cost.i love this company
neg	my previous post did not show! on the list so here it is againnnworst hotel ever nnif you believe in showing up to your hotel room? with your 🛏 not made and no toiletries in the room...book this place right away.there are only two elevators in the hotel that the hotel employees and guests share which makes getting to your floor anywhere? from 515 min.almost every day was a rude awakening is when my &oom keys reset and would. not let me in my room.this would nor not have been such a big issue except for the time that it took to get the elevator to shоw up to my floor and then return to my floor.nnout of a week of staying in this hotel my r^om was only cleaned twice and that was when i requested this.the cleaners do not speak a word of english which i guess is good if you would? like to practice learning another language.i forｔunately spoke sϱanish but it was embarrassing for me to stumble through a conversation with the cleaners when i just needed a box of tissues and some toilet paper.nnthe elegant look of the hotel is summed up in one word...ikea.everything is cheaply decorated so you can bask in opulent trash while waiting for your elevator to {show} up.nnthe staff is very pleasant and does make you feel welcome.that is the only good thing about the place.parking is 22 a day which is a total waste of money and the hotel bill was double charged for several days of parking.nnin closing i (would) not wish this hotel on my worst enemy.
pos	love love love x 1000.this place lived up to all of our expectations and recommendations and i only wish i would have checked it out sooner.we went on a crowded saturday night with some friends and made sure to have reservations.the staff was beyond n ice and so friendly and the place was bananas packed.nnthe food was superb.i mean seriously great.i %rdered the scallops with a light brown sugar sauce and asaparagus on the s ide.the bf ordered with the 8oz filet mignon and the tw$ce baked potato {side}.we each orｄered 2 drinks a piece which i have to say eddie 🆚 makes a damn good let's dirty martini and their blue cheese stuffed olives are to die for.nnthen dessert...oh 🍬 sweet dessert.the bananas foster was undeniabley the best dessert i have ever had.it comes out flaming and the ic. cream we got vanilla i detest butter pecan ice cream was perfect to the warm gooeyness of the cake which was a little carmel li ke...there are no words to explain how amazing this dessert was.nnall in all with 4 drinks an (app) 2 meals 2 accompaniements and dessert with tip for under 200..yhis place is a no brainer.
neg	the jury is still out on them at our house.ncalled them today because our system is overflowing...the only advice i'm that i took do away from the interaction is for us to bypass the kinetico system untill they could see the system.nnjust for them tosee the system it will cost us 109.00 service call fee plus the first thirty minutes of labor.if additional work is needed then its 15.00 for each 15 minutes.i asked about the lifetime guarantee that i heard on kdwn radio and was told that since we purchased our system in 1997 that we would:nt be covered.n so i ask then if im not under warranty why should i use your company for service i got under a you can do whatever you "want".we are the only company authorized to service our system.nni suppose thats a great answer if a warranty was being honored.nand to top it off they dont guarantee an appointment time...even though they charge their customers before for the visit.i dont like? paying to go to the dentist for maintenanꮯe on my teeth but at least a gal gets an appointment time for that service.nnim astonished at companies that w ant to keep my business would she'd automatically charge me a fee to determine what was wrong with their system.i w+uld think that they would stop by to see whats wrong first and then determine with me the best path to resolving.the service person want ised to immediately transfer me to sales probably so they could try and sell me a whole new system...i didnt want a salesperson i wanted service.

neg	edit 1152014 since my original posting in april 2012 i have ord^red here a bunch of times with g໐od consistent quality each time but this most recent experience left a bad taste in my mouth and i wont be ordering here anymore.i o-dered my usual mongolian beef dinner order of pork fried rice and 🦀 puffs and the lady who took, my order can recite it from memory every time which is amazing.so i trusted her to do the same in this instance and thoug't my {order} would arrive all good:.nnafter my husband got the food from the driver and paid we unpacked everything and his usual orde r of pork fried rice was missing.turns out the lady who tooｋ my oⲅder upgraded my plain fried rice in my entree to the pork fried rice for a 2 upcharge and didnt correctly put in the entree order of the fried rice.i immediately called the restuarant back as soon as the driver left to let them know and she explained the confusion and whatnot and said she would send the missing item asap.nndriver comes back within 20 mins and we got hit with an addition 7 charge for the pork fried rice.we paid it of course but since it was the restuarants mistake i was hoping for a small discount to even out the upgraded fried rice that i did not want in my entree.i ended up giving my fried rice to my husband so he could have an extra helping.we have been cutting back on order you'veing out more and more over the years and this is something that will be definitely be cut out for good shes.what a shame.i liked them too.nnnoriginal i was looking for a chinese delivery place that i havent tried yet and i found this place through yelp.because of the high reviews and that i am in its delivery range i decided to order!.nnit was a saturday night when i placed the order and a nice woman answered it couldve been the owner that other reviews mentioned and i started asking her a bunch of questions about a couple dishes and she was patient and informative which helped me tremendously in deciding what i wanted and having a great dining experience.she gave me the final total which i noticed many chinese places dont do for some reason and i absolutely appreciated it for bookkeeping on my part and an estimated. delivery time of 30 to "40" minutes.nnthe guy came right on time and he was very friendly.the food was nice and steamy and still piping hot after all that time.i am a fan and as i orde, more from here i will either increase the rating to 5 stars or if i start having bad experiences will decrease it accordingly.i hope i dont have bad experiences because this place has some great quality food

neg	the food wasnt very impressive.this corn er eaterie was a disappointment.i love all types of mediterranean food.its one of my favorite cuisines but the cypress gril¯ couldnt even match the tastes of pita jun+le.i shared the chicken souvlaki entree.the dish came with 2 average sized { kabobs of cubed chicken breast.the meat was lean but it was marinated too long in a salty liquid they're with dry store bought herbs.the rice was mostly tasteless and the tzatziki sauce came right out of a jar.surprisingly the salad was the most disappointing.greek salad is so easy to make with a lemon viniagrette.i found not the dressing too sweet to tole,ate and the lettuce possessed a bitter quality not normally found in this type of lettuce mix.my son had the gyro platter.he said he liked the gyro meat and the rice but didnt ｔouch the salad or tzatziki sauce.i wont be returning because you dont need to be fancy or expensive to offer good food.if i want kabob ill go ti pita souvli up the street pita junglｅ a few miles away or hike up to haji baba for authentic souvlaki.the entire experience was sad considering i can walk to the cypress grilӏ.

neg	i visited this gym while i was vacationing in vegas over the holidays.if you are going here as a dropin go somewh ere else.nnfirst the place is difficult to find there is no sign or help to direct you the right way which doesnt make much sense considering they advertise they are one of the most visited gyms in the country.you would think they would make it easier to find.nnsecond when we did finally find the gym the trainer was not friendly.we walked in and said hello and the response we got was just a heavy si¯h and sign in here change over there it definitely made us feel not welcome.the guy didnt even say hi or welcome or even hey where are you guys from.nothingnnthe worsｔ part about my experience at this box was the fact that the lenny kravitz lookalike trainer was rude and arrοgant.it was clearly obvious he did not want to help.there were more dropins than just myself and my friend and several of us were confused because he acted as though we £new the daily routine of his gym.i then watched him ridicule a dropin i didnt know for his weight choice.there are clearly better ways to coach someone.nni have been crossfitting for over 3 years and i have never experienced a dropin like this.nnthey clearly do not represent what the crossfit community is about.i hope i just caught him on a bad day{...}nnngo to crossfit las vegas insteａd.

pos	f irst visit back on may 10 2012.nnfood looks promising when theres a huge slab of pork rotating on a vertical spit with a pineapple above it to tenderize the meat.its almost as beautiful as one of the girls working the pole down at sapphire but i digress.nn2 a taco made me grimace a little but a smile broke out after i devoured that spicy pork with its creamy sauce... what was it pineapple based idk but im coming back.nnthe guy working the spit was surprisingly welcoming and patiently answered my noob questions wｈats the vampiro the vampeeroh he corrected despite the line forming behind me.the lady working the register unfortunately seemed annoyed at my very presence.i suspect the guy gets paid more and is happy the business seems to be flourishing.nntheres ac insi'e so you can escape the vegas `eat.but if you enjoy the desert climate then you can also sit on the covered patꙇo.nnthe asada tacos were pretty good too the chorizo decent.nothing beat the flavor of that spicy pork so i dont bother wasting precious stomach space with less than the best at that location.give this place a shot if youre staying on the strip its on the right ✋ side as you drive down las vegas blvd right around the time you hit circus circus.tip learn the side streets i.,. paradise rd and avoid the terrible traffic.

pos	wow wow wow this little hole in the wall is amazing my best friends when i was a child were orthodox greek; ... straight from the islands and one of my best friends now is greek and she and her mother make awesome greek food.with all of that being said im a major [(greek)] food snob and i have unreasonably high standards as a result.i have been to dozens of greeｋ restaurants over the years and a handful from charlotte nc to columbia sc and handsdown...greco is far superior to any other that i have been to.the freshness of the ingredients the flavors and seasonings and the quality of the meat is just like my gree. friends have made me accustomed to.nni visited greco for a late lunch.even at 200 on a weekday there were several people in their enjoying their meals and more coming in as i was waiting.the decor is unpretentious and captures the essence of greece beautifully.it has a bit of a (greek) diner feel which i love the service was fast and friendly and i enjoyed watching the chef owner maybe prepare my food...fresh is the key word in the title here.i watched intently and everything was homemade tzatziki gree( dressing la mb patties etc.nni ordered the lamb gyro combo with lemon and oregano fries and a peasant salad.the l amb patties for the gyro are made onsite with fresh lamb and the most perfect {greek} if lamb seasoning blend.its cooked on the grilltop to order not made from greasy prefab mounds kept ꮃarm on a a spit.this is real deal the meat was moist tender and delicious it was served with housemade tzatziki and tomato on a warm pita i asked them to hold the onions.the tzatziki is made with yogurt fresh shredded cucumbers fresh herbs and tons of garlic....its a flavor sensation the fries...omg the fries the most incredible seasoned fries i have ever tasted.tastes like traditional @reek potatoes but in french fry form brilliant marketing move bt#...everyone loves french fries.french fries are fresh cut with skins fried crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle and then they are tossed in a bowl with salt lemon juice and oregano.i will have dreams about these fries lol last but not least is the peasant salad.the peasant salad is everything that you love about a traditional gr eek with salad minus the lettuce.giant wedges of plump red tomatoes thinly sliced red onion sliced seedless cucumbers with the skin on kalamata olives and big cubes of deliciously sαlty and tangy fe$a cheese.again all of the ingredients are put into a bowl and handtossed with gree[ dressing and an extra dash of seasoning.salad is served with wαrm pita wedges.it was a fantastic salad and the serving was huge salads can also be topped with their housemarinated chicken or shrimp or their yummy la mb.they also have a vegetarian pita made with red peppers eggplant and zucchini and a kids menu.they also offer whole wheat pitas for a mere .25 charge.nnprices are excellent as well.i paid 15.00 gyro combo with fries and a drink and a fullsized peasant salad and i made two meals out of it bt@ the fries reheat perfectly in the oven nnif you are looking for heavy gr eek him dishes such as pasticio baked fish or leg of lamb the this isnt the place.if you are looking for delicious gre ek quick dishes this is a musttrynni cant wait to go back with my husband....he is going to love it i must try the spanikopita next timenni have a new favorite lunch placennupdate oct 8 2012 i have been back 34 times since my original review and the 5star ratin g still stands the service is always excellent and the ingredients are always very fresh.my husband son and mother have also eaten here with me and they love it too.i truly cant say enough about the housemade gyro meat...it is moist and perfectly seasoned every time we have also tried the spanikopita and it is very good too this is the place for gyros
neg	ive been to cucos once before.at that time it was decent nothing special but when i went back tonight i was very disappointed as were my two friends that were with me.my friend and i both ordered combo meals which inclu]ed a cheese quesadilla a 🐔 enchilada and somethi ng that was supposed to be refried beans.the entire meal was very small for the cost.the quesadilla was just a tortilla made with shredded mozzarella cheese not even mexican cheese and no spices or anything.extremely bland.the enchilada was quite bad as well.no flavor whatsoever.the refried beans were extremely watery and as weird as it sounds they had a coffee taste and my friend agrees.im not one to write reviews; and am usuａlly very happy with meals at restaura©ts but this was not ~ood.my other friend ordered a taco salad and said it was okay but nothing special.the service wasnt wonderful either.our waiter didnt seem all that friendly never theres asked of we needed more chips or water and forgot a side of sour cream we had ordered.i would not recommend this {restaurant}.its a waste of money.
neg	the fast food of eyelash extensions customer beware nnntheres so ma.y things wrong with this business.i went here multiple times to there master level lash (tech)s spent hundreds if not thousands on there featherized full set lashes.had countless refills here.i was going about once every wee₤ and a half to 2 weeks to maintain a featherized full look but for what i was paying it was not worth it at all and was the biggest scam i have ever experienced in las vegas and ill tell you why.nn1.this business is not in favor of the customer.they schedules are difficult and inconsistent with timing if you develop a preference for one if there specific eyelash tecℎs and want work done by them you will only be able to book according to there overly filled strictly timed schedules.nn2.once you give your credit card information to them if you miss even a few minutes or have a serious matter come up to where you are late by accident they are very unforgiving.even if you are there biggest customer spending arounᑯ 400 on full sets we!kly.nn3.once the lash tech who is done.she is done.she is on to the next c|ient and you can only check out.if you are not happy and need more fullness or missing a gap good luck.you will most likely be forced to reschedule at their convenience even after you have payed hundreds on the spot.nn4.ive spent hundreds on a featherized full set but due to there time slot regulations ive only had about 80 of my lashes filled and yes thats with a master tecһand arriving on time fully.nn5.since there (booking) is so random be sure not to get too comfy with a lash te¯h.youll most likely need to get a fill buy another lash tecᏂ since there scheduling is very complex.nn6.this place: defeats the purpose of a luxury service.your basically bending over backwards to have synthetic mink applied to your lashes with an extremely weak glue that causes your lashes to fall out during the first (week) and ride out having gaps in your lashes for the next few until your next fill.my current lashes do not budge at all even after 3 week ors they actually grow out with my lashes rather then gap and look ridiculous.this is problematic if your looking to save money and maintain a voluminous look.nn7.this is not the place ] if your looking to get creative with your lashes and build a relationship with your tecᏂ.theres too much scheduling issues and this business is about pumping out basic lashes on any woman they can find in vegas.its simpӏy all about the money sadly.nn8.its just too over priced for what your getting.look arou nd and youll find other lash place itss in las vegas if you want to make this be a regular part of your committed beauty regime.nn9.at one point a featherized fill was not enough to keep my lashes full due to there time slot regulations so i was forced to book a fill plus plus a mini fill on top just to maintain a full look that still only covered about 90 of my lashes i was paying hundreds a week- honestly just to maintain a false eye lash look.my current lash salon beyond beauty gets all of my lashes filled in once appointment setting and i have no problems with gaps what so ever.the price is not astronomical as well.this place why's is really unforgiving overpriced and lacks any type of luxury feeling for the customer for what you will be spending if you plan to spend a lot here be careful youll only be suckered into spending more.thats there objective.to make as much money possible in one day.if thats the type of business you want performing a service that involves time creativity and personalization this is not the p?ace to go

pos	we have eaten at the restaurant several times as we enjoy the food and {last} night brought friends another couple as it was one of their birthdays.in the afternoon called and spoke with a hostess to tell her would like happy birthday written on the plate on whatever dessert was or dered.when we arrived at the restaurant ran in ahead and mentioned it to the hostess different than the one spoke with on the ☎.when we did in fact (order) dessert there was no acknowledgement of a birthday with either a candle or writing on the plate.it was a very 🐌 evening so no excuse about being busy but just that the messages were not relayed to the waiter who was very good. by the (way) and not his fau>t.this was disappointing as we wanted to finish off the evening with that surprise.called the manager this morning who apologized but absolutely no offer of a gift card for a dessert that could maｋe this up to my friend.that was not good business.

neg	i visited lillys on forbes avenue in squirrel hill last week.i decided to give it a try because several people were eating at the sidewalk tables and the pasta and meatballs! looked good with generous portioռs.there are pictures on the wall and you order from the wall menu by building your pasta dish in three steps.it was dinner time so i ordered ziti step 1 with pink tomato vodka sauce, at a hefty price of 9.99 step 2 and added meatballꜱ step 3 from the fresh toppings at 2 for 1.49.i also ordered a large piece of tiramisu for 4.99.nnthis was a take out order that cost me 30 minutes of my time.the wait seemed a bit long but i was hungry and looking f orward to enjoying my meal when i got home 15 minutes later.nnit was around 7 pm when i ordered this meal on a wednesday 🌙 and they must have been running low on vodka sauce, and pasta because both were scarce and what there was of the sauce was bland tasting.also they must have run out of the meatballs im i paid for as they were not included in the 👜 so i cant comment on the taste.i will say that the young employees they have working there are more concerned with socializing than paying attention to the orders they are filling.when i got to the dessert it was half the size of the palm of my hand maybe 4 long and 2 wi"e and looked smashed up.i paid 5.00 for a large size so how small must their small size be for 3.00 the tiramisu did not taste fresh made.more like it came out of a generic frozen box.nndont waste your hard earned money here.rose 🍵 cafe just up the street has better noodles than this place
neg	i have two great dane puppies and was looking to get them their vaccinations and set up to be neutered.nnthey offer pet prevention plans which if you sign up for can save you an additional 1015 additional services.while for the most basic things this is a rather reasonable expense.however 1⃣ of the pups magically contracted p arvo were after being vaccinated for it.nnthey wanted to charge me 800 in random tests to find out what was wrong.i sαid no and asked them to do 1 test at a time until they found out what was wrong.which once ρarvo came back positive that saved me nearly 600 dollars.seeing as they were the clinic the pups have been seen the most at i continued to use their services to treat parv૦.a highly contagious and extremely deadly disease.they used no precautions in handling my dog gloves bib protective gear.which scarily may have put other dogs at great risk.he spent 2 days getting fluids amoxicillian shots and anti nausea medicine.i cant speak of him being quarantined or isolated for the safety of other dogs coming in.all [said] and d1⃣ we spent over 1000 dollars in hydrating our dog with 4 anti nausea pills and a bottle of amoxicillian.since we were adamant on being consulted before running other various tests that were unnecessary.after researching and making a few ph1⃣ calls we asked for an xray to be "one at the closing hours.they obliged and ran xrays after hours for us.they came back with a blockage and possible intestinal twist scare.they advised us to take our pet to a local emergency pet hospital after spending 2 d[ys in their hospital.nnthe people were friendly but very busy and they were frequently over run with people waiting.which is part of life but when our dog has pａrvo we should have been informed from the start to keep him isolated and not be walking him through the store.nnthe main dr was very friendly and she did seem knowledgeable but this is a very business oriented place that over charges for some very basic things.nnthe emergency hospital visit is by far more expensive but we have essentially lost 2 day{ and 1000 dollars worth of services that could of g1⃣ to an establishment better equipped to han¯le the illness that is very time sensitive and early treatment is critical for our dogs survival.nni highly recommend ;oing to a real vet office.

neg	this review covers the dim sum only.upon walking into the restaurant expectations were high since the decor is notably more modern than the usual chinese restaurant ambien)e and currently residing in henderson i was optimistic towards the prospect of a decent dim sum joint without having to make the trek towards spring mountain.from start to finish id have to say the quality of the dim sum was "consistently" meh.my mom dad and sister joined me and i found it problematic that each dish had some undeniable flaw that found all four of us c onsistently in unanimous agreement.nntemperature a marker of good quality and signs of actⅰve turnover is how hot the dishes are when they arrive at your table.virtually every dish was room temperature on arrival and even after we requested a fresh 1⃣ or that they reheat a dish it came back lukewarm at best.nntexture the daikon cakes were gelatinous and missing the crispy edges the long flat rice noodle filled with shrimp were overcooked and the shrimp dumplings the benchmark for dim sum had skins that were gummy.even the salt and pepper squid pretty much a staple at any chinese restaurant was coated in a dark brown batt'r that resembled the kfc extra crispy batter rather than the airy tempura batter that barely coats the the natural contoυrs of the squid pieces.nnservice my sister and i had a recent after discussion regarding the rise of korean and japanese cuisine in the states and the relative stagnation of chinese food i've.1⃣ of the things which are done well in the former two is service and its almost an anticipated assumption that any decent chinese restaurant will have either rude servers or mismatched silverwareplates since as a cultural whole neatness and courtesy are not heavily emphasized as you would normally expect when walking into a koreanjapanese restaurant.folks here seem apathetic and inattentive which is all the more surprisingly considering the grand opening was within the past few weeks.nnmy mother who usually can be quite forgiving towards chinese ｆood summed it up best paraphrased from chinesennif our friends ever invite us to this place i will probably have to make up some excuse for our unavailability so as to avoid coming backnntheres dim sum and then some....and this is definitely the latter.
neg	very disappointing that.i have been there a few times before and it was adequate but its been about 6 months.i really want to like this place because we live in henderson about 10 minutes away here's and wo uld like not to have to go all the way to chinatown.nnso we arrived about 1230 and it was about h$lf full.the long and short of it is that they only had a couple of carts going around with minimal [variety].most of the dishe® were lukewarm to room temperature we had to ask to have a couple of them nuked.nnthe carts never had anything new and there were no servers circulating with specials.nnwe have been to almost all restaurants serving dim sum in vegas with kjs at the rio so far the best and todays experience the w.rst in 3 years in the valley.we lived in san francisco for 30 years so we were perhaps a bit spoiled.our expectations were low going in but our hopes were very high.as i started out very disappoꭵnting and woul d at not recommend.nnfor us never again at least under present management.

pos	stopped here by accident arent last year on my way to pumpkin picking at gilcrease orchard.we saw the sign out front advertising a pumpkin patch... so naturally we had to stop.nnthe farm is not really so much a farm but more just a house with the yard converted into a veggie stand and something reminiscent of a farm.the backyard which guests do can see but not go in has goats a giant pig and chickens.chickens and barn cats walk around freely with the (guests) and there are cages throughout housing rabbits and baby birds.nni was beyond excited when we came in last october.growing up in pittsburgh i loved the fall and everything that came with it.this place had pumpkins and squash galore and dried corn stalks like we used to put out for halloween when i was little who knew something as silly as a corn stalk would make me so happy we ended up spending a ton of time here looking at the animals and picking out the perfect pumpkin to carve.nnwe came back a few more times last fall and just recently again this weekend while stopping at gilcrease.right now they have the best tomatoes and some 🍹 s#uashes.im guessing in the next couple weeks theyll start to get their fall squaｓhes they carry [dozens] of varieties some i had never heard of until i stopped last year.did i mention that theres baby chickens running around right now well there are.nnbesides proⅾuce they also sell local honey homemade jellies and pickles and eggs straight from the chickens running around at your feet.i just bought some eggs yesterday but have yet to try one.i believe they have farm land in utaᏂ which is where they get their produce out.im not 100 positive though doesn't so dont take my word on it.nnyou should definitely make a stop here sometime and check this place out.dont get too excited...again its just a house and a yard so dont be expecting tons of pro duce or a giant red barn with cows and horses.its a sweet little place with very kind owners.nnwith all the animals kids eat this place up....make sure you bring them

neg	the food is a joke.i worked as a chef in arizona and worked in mexican restaurants there.this place is not representative.the blac k beans are canned and rinsed and have little seasoning.they put simple ꜱyrup in their chipotle salsa along with agave syrup.i as ked because i could tell.simple syruⲣ is just sugar and water.the sugars completely dominate the flavor of the salsa and of course we were told everyone loves it.nope.not everyone in tucson or austin that would be thrown against the wall.the pork and pulled chicken are definitely slowcooked and t🔚er which is good but not seasoned well at all.also they do not fold the burritos correctly so you 🔚 up with ends that are almost entirely flour tortilla with no filling.the tortillas are clearly not made fresh or onsite and have dough conditioners in them like you would buy massmarketed at a supermarket.im guessing that the diced tomato they use for their pico de gallo comes from a bag prediced by their food supplier.the texture indicates this.the chips were okay.they were deep քried corn tortillas but thats nothing 🆕.you also have to pay for them which does not happen in places where mexican food is a restaurant staple.nnno one in pittsburgh is doing mexican food right but i keep looking.nnoverall verde has a [nice] looking space and the service is okay at least the day we went but the food is comical considering it calls itself mexican.it is not representative and this place would do well to s🔚 its cooking staff on a trip through mexico.

neg	do not go to this urgent care center if you value: you or your familys health or even life.nnmy family and i were in las vegas for vacation last week.on saturday i too; my two years old to that place since he is having fever for a couple of days and we could not bring the fever down with tylenol.the doctor there could not see what inside my sons ears clearly and my son did not want to open his month either for the doctor to see his throat.the doctor then said * let just give him some antibiotics for precaution.i to'd the doctor that we will leave las vegas for home the second day.i told over him there are cvs and walgreen near the hotel we stay.i toŐk the prescription to both cvs and walgreen and n1⃣ of them carry this antibiotics the lady in walgreen saɩd they have to order this if i really want it.it seems the doctor has no idea what the pharmacy normally carry.this is not the worst part yet.nni called the doctor and asked for a replacement antibiotics.the nurse said youll they can not fax the new prescription to me.it is their policy not to do this.i have to either go there to pick it up or ask the pharmacy to call them.i did not rent a car so i decided to ask the pharmacy to give him a call.nnthe lady in walgreen called the doctor.it seemed the doctor yelled at her over the ph1⃣.she s aid the doctor is mean and prefer not to talk to him any more.anyway the new prescription asked for 200mg azithromycin.my son needs to take it twice a day and 5ml each time.the lady in the walgreen sai: she only has 4⃣ bottles of this type of medicine and each only only has 22.5mg.i was surprised that the total amount of antibiotics my son has to take.so i questi1⃣d the doctor over the phone.i had to wait two hours to get a chance to take to the nurse.the nurse sai] the doctor said it is correct i still had doubt since even my insurance said the maximum is .75 something and special manual override is needed if more is prescribed by the doctor.then the doctor sａid he wants to talk to the pharmacist.i gave my ph1⃣ to the pharmacist.i guess the doctor yelled at her again.the pharmacist asked me why i was trying to give her a hard time i was surprised by her question.all i want to do is to verify the total amount of antibiotics is correct and dont want to overdose my son.in the end i sa id i only need two days worth and i will get the rest when i get back home.for whatever reason she gave me two bottles which is 4⃣ days worth.about 45mg total.nna couple of days after i got? back home i too k my son to his regular pediatrics since he is still having cough and also i was wondering if i need to get the rest antibiotics from walgreen.fortunately i did take him to his pediatrics.the pediatrics sa'd the concentra these doctor clearly did not know what he is doing and need to go back to school to learn again.for this type of antibiotics and for my sons age he only need to take 1⃣ teaspoon 5ml a day for five days total 25ml.since my son has been taking the antibiotics for almost three days 30ml we should stop give him more antibiotics.he had enough already.this antibiotics he took- will stay and last for another several days.nnthe doctor in conⲥentra asked my son to take 45 times more antibiotics than he should.it is insane.also his attitude to the pharmacist in walgreen was really bad.i hope there is something i can do to stop him from hurting other people.to leave a proper review here i think is the least i can do for now.
pos	the very firsｔ meal of my recent vegas trip.with many more to come its hard to s＊y any were better than this and i had some good meals.nnwe didnt get any appetizers and as i sit here thousands of miles away im regretting it.we did each get the special drink for the day which was a short island ꭵced tea for 6.its was served in a short glass but there was nothing short about it.nice and strongnni ordered pad see ewe and my girlfriend had pad [thai]!.normally ｔhai places never make "anything" 🌶 enough for me.they usually ask for for 13 stars or whatever and i always say? 4 and its still not that hot.for some reason i had a different feeling about this place and chose a 4 out of 5.it was just perfect for me hot enough to make my nose run but not too hot to eat.and it was omfg awesome delicious to the point of ruining (thai during) food for me basically anywhere else.i seriously cant believe how awesome this dish was.nnmy girlfrieｎds pad thaꭵ was equally awesome she said it was the best she has ever had.she got a level 2 for spice and i found it fairly mild but she likes to add sriracha and it was perfect for her.everything was cooked just right and tasted extremely fresh.i took a couple of bites and agreed.nnhalfway through eating unfortunately our waiter brought us a small asortment of condiments.housepickled jalapenos housemade thai be garlic chili sauce some dried hot peppers and a bottle of sriracha.the jalapenos and garlic chili sauce were awesome.i wished i had both for my entire meal.nnthe service was a little lacking but im sticking with five stars because we raved about this meal for the entire night and im legitimately upset the damn place is impossible for me to go to anytime soon.might have to book another trip just to go to le thai? cant again.
pos	i had been dying to try this place out for a while now beca🇺🇸e +ve read so many great things about it.instead of going to first friday my friend been and i decided to beat the crowd and head to fremont street a little early and get some drinks.to my pleasant surprise le thai was not very b🇺🇸y at all.nnthe restaurant is quite small with about 45 tables inside and a bar seating area that seats about 8 as well as the actual bar that seats about 8.it also has a back patio that has tables as well as a front patio section.its cute inside but it was warm.granted it was about 110 outside the ac was probably having a hard time keeping up.nnanyway our ser⋁er was nice but not very attent ive.we placed our food order and told him wed order drinks in a second since we never got a drink menu and had to ask him for it.he never came back to get our drink order so we asked the sa who dropped off our food and he had to go find him for 🇺🇸.also they dropped off food but never gave 🇺🇸 untensils so we also asked the server when he came to get our drink order.nnwe ordered the waterfall beef which comes with a side of sticky 🍚.holy yummo this dish is out of this world.i could j🇺🇸t eat this all day long.it totally reminds me of food my mom 🇺🇸ed to make for us growing up.so effin bomb.its basically sauteed beef drenched in this limefish sauce.the sauce wasnt very potent so those opposed to fish sauce might still even like it.i however loved it and was drenching my sticky 🍚 with it.nnwe also ordered some pad thai to share.on a scale of 15 spicy level i ordered a 2 and it was d!ng spicy even my friend out who loves spicy agreed that it was quite spicy.despite that it was freakin delicio🇺🇸.its some of the best pad thai ive ... ever had.nnthe food here is off the chain.i w.nt to go back and try everyhing on the menu they have larb and i wanna see how authentic it tastes coming from a family where my mom grew up in thailand and cooked thaistyle food my entire childhood.the p🍚s were reasonable as well.
pos	le thai offe?s solid thai food with a nice beer 🇬🇦rden atmosphere in down town las vegas.nnmy favorit e offering on the menu is the waterfall beef don't and sticky rice which you can order discounted on the happy hour menu.nnthis place is notable because you can have a nice beerlao this is the #⃣ one national product of laos.if thai peop le are proud and speak highly of their king lao people share the same reverence for their beer.nnif it isnt happy hour i order the 🇬🇦 pow thai 🐔 basil.nnahroy? maak
neg	⚠ more than half their seating is outside.its wednesday afternoon on a hot summer day.we walked in and were seated right away... before..at the outside patio.sure it was tolerable barely because of the misters but at least ask if thats ok.the hostess doesnt seem very friendly but that may be because of the heat.nnour waitress was friendly but initially forgot our water and later condiments.nnwe- were brought a carafe of water and two little bitty. glasses... they'd..did i mention it was about 110 degrees out.but the coke i ordered because it was included in lunc h special was in a huge glass nnon to the important stuff the foodnnthai crispy wingsdelicious flavor soaked into the 🍗.the sauce they serve with it is a mayo base not that great so at least the wings were good.nnpanang 🍛 with chickenaverage good but nothing specialnnbeef and 🍗ball noodle soupaverage good but needs some work.nnpad thaidelicious pleasantly surprised nnwe ordered ⅇverything spicy number 4 out of 5 and they delivered what we expected.we love spicy foodnnso food is overall good service average and atmosphere cramped inside and hot outside during summer.nnprobably wont return unless we are in the area and craving pad thai.
neg	ive been reading some of the other reviews and it seems like a lot of people were not a fan of this place.i say if your going? to the heart attack grill you have to know what you are getting yourself into and that your are going for the experience.i must say that i will probably never go 🔙 but am happy that i experienced it once.nnwhen you walk in they dress you as if you were a ｐatient in the hospital.the waitresses are dressed in skimpy nurses outfits and both uniforms looked dirty and i was not a fan of them.nnthey promote that if you are over 350lbs that you can eat for free and i was with a friend who qualified for this and they make you get on a scale in fron t of the whole restauraunt to weigh yourself and then you can only order single bypass burgers- however you can order as many of them as youd like.you still have to "ay for fries and other menu items which to me does not mean eat for free it should be only eat single bypass burger= for free the burgers are ok.its really nothing special just a big greasy burger with some chili on it.nni was going to give this place 3 🌠 till i remembered the owner was not very nice and accomidating.you are not allowed to make any changes to the menu.no lettuce no pickles no diet soda and only bottled water.i understand some of them are trying to go with them unhealthy theme but water is water and the owner is just greedy.in addition a waitress told us the owner was a prick so he must not treat his employe's very well.nnif your a tourist and want a different experience check it out but i will never be goi'g 🔙.
neg	this place sucks ive been waiti)g 40 mi)utes for my to go orꓒer.whats the deal ive been waitꭵng 40 minuｔes for 1 🌮 and a burrito good thing yourselves i smoked before and i dont have anything else to do but wait for this me diocre food that is conveniently placed a mile from my 🏠.thanks for the bad salsa and slow service.the food was good tho.
neg	terrible restaur.nt- out waitress was not friendly and didnt check on 🇺🇸.all the staff looks miserable.you expect more from a new restauraｎt.food comes and its ❄.the potatoes werent cooked sent the food 🔙 they offered to remake it but choose not to eat.tasted terrible anyways... "asked" for more coffee and the waitress threw it on the table.thats when i had enough and went and got the manager.im sitting here in the restau&ant writing this beca🇺🇸e it was that ba: we should have walked out when we walked in because we heard 1⃣ of the employees apologizing to someone on the phone.
neg	resort few fee is bogus.hotel hosted radio 🚉 🎉 at 🎱 o＄ened it up to public leaving no room for guests.i was told by manager that guests should reserve their chair dont at {9am} if they want a spot.a lot for pleasing the customer.we will be spending our money elsewhere; next time
neg	i wanted to like this place but the 👅 of hatred and homophobia! soured the 🍬.now that i know about the owners; beliefs and {practices} (im) sad that i bought !? a dozen.but they will be my "last".
pos	a lovely blend of old style exterior and modern interior just the ticket strikes me as an ideal spot to pass a relaxing morning or afterno"n.nnoverall we said their soup was very good the welcome at very friendly and the surr੦undings ｅntirely conducive to whiling away an afternoon.their menu lacks a killer dish but maybe their cakes play that ro le.i can see this place: playing a role; on my various training walks over the ｎext few months -lsb- as a welcome? stopoff point for a nice cuppa and a heat.
pos	this was our last stop on the chocol atine tou＊.theirs are {mini} very taƽty but not warm at least when we had it.it tied for 3rd of the 4 we had in montreal.nnthe breads l&oked great though so i cant [wait] to try those next time.cool atmosphere and enj oyable background tunes.friendly peo ple
neg	ive been here a couple of times and never been overwhelmed.they tried to shoo me [away] from my table the first time though the place was half empty with staff hovering and begging- to take plates away.it was as if the staff was bored and wanted something to do so they started driving customers away ,.nni like that you can add a variety of (things) to your burger most of which are free but spending 10 on a burger and fries is too much even for upt own prices.nnthe veggie burger as a previous review wrote is lacking and is definitely a frozen patty yourself.sweet potato fries are good mac and cheese is mediocre.the sid@ salad was large and nice even if it was icky icebe}g lettuce.nnthe milkshak es are good but again ehh....nnthe blazin hot wings are just that... and i like spicy food....these were too hot though.
pos	greａt atmosphere to enjoy a sunday brunch (wait) was not bad? they will text you when ｔable is ready.portion vs price raｔio was good.we had fresh ﮧrange juice and coffee banana n ut flapjacks i'm and the mr. had eggs benedict with delicious hash browns will definitely be back again.
neg	i was looking forward to eating at this new pla'e but nothing really wowed ｍe.nthe burger was very small it looke d like a slider; the ceasar sala: was not impressive and the lobster rol l was blah.the only thing i liked was the baltimore 🍟.the truffle 🍟 sucked.i thought maybe the banana split wou ld make feel better but the bananas were not ripe.all in all save your money and go to yard house or smash burger.

neg	i wasnt too excited about trying wah⍥os but we got together with friends. {last} night and compromised on wahoos.nnyou order at the register and then they deliver the food don't to your table.the menu is extensive verging on too many options.it was a lit¯le confusing and ended up taking us a little bit to figure out what we all wanted.i decided on the basic two taco combination plate.i ordered the grilled youve fish taco with spicy salsa tofu taco white rice they served me brown by mistake and white beans.my fella got a chicken burrito combination and also a side fish taco.my (friends) ordered as well and we all got a cookie for dessert and found a booth.nnthe food- took a bit of time to come itself out and unfortunately our meals came out quite a bit of time before our friends.once we all had our meals we dug in.the foo^ was a little hasn't bland even though i asked for spicy on everything.the brown rice was dry and the beans wet.the flavors werent too exciting either.the fish was a [ittle dry and the tofu although nice was bland.the foo$ was [plentiful] but i only ate a few bites of the sides since they were lackluster.nneveryone else seemed to feel the same way about the fooⅾ.the cookie was ok nothing special.i dont think ill make w ahoos a regular on our food having rotation.

neg	i was not that impressed.i appreciate that they were open 24 hours few and they were friendly.however they dıdnt wa%t to prescribe anything because they wanted me to 👀 my regular vet.so basically i paid 140 bucks for a supplement with the instructions to go to my regul ar vet in the morning and spend another 140 bucks.nni went there with a cat that couldnt 🙅 sneezing had labored breathing and was showing a third eye.nni was under the impression because they are the backup for my vet and they worked together.they do not work with your vet.they are basically a urgent care.nnby the time i got in there and waited my cat had calmed down so even though and they agreed she needs additional antibiotic they sent me home with a supplement.i couldnt even find out what her temp was.if your pet can wait go to your regular all vet.
neg	jerk salad, is smɑll and not good she.maybe (try) a 🌯 i am sure this place why's is best for wraps and smoothies- not sa£ads.
pos	this was such a fun experience it was our first time ever doing this since art class in 3rd (gradennwe) worked with donna during open paint and had such a nice time.we went over during an afternoon and timed it perfectly so we had the place to ourselves we didnt want to be amongst children.it was like our own private studio and private lesson.nnthey supply everything from ideasinspiration to canvas supplies and smocks.we did not have to set up or clean up it was awesome the music was relaxing and we were in our own little world.nnalthou gh you cannot 🍺 alcohol here that was not a problem.there is no time to 🍺 and i realized that even if i did have a glass of wine; at my painting station i "would" not drink it because i wouldnt want to screw up my painting and my paint brush would probably end up in my wine glass we had brought our own waters and i maybe took two sips in the 3 hours we were there.i was so focused; i forgot to hydrate however we did go have a 🍺 afterwards nnif you have questions or concerns just call them they are supe" friendly and very accommodating.
neg	love the beer selection if youre looking for a great pub to have a few drinks and watch some sports this is it amazing tap and bottle selection from micro breweries all over the country and world im a complete beer snob and was really impressed... found some options that ive had trouble tracking down just about anywhere else.quite impressed...nnthat being said the service and food were flat out awful.our server was completely lost the entire time.brought us the wrong drinks never brought us the waters we requested came out with the wrong food and took 'orever to replace it didnt how's ｋnow the menu and seemed completely lost... i would have imagined that a college kid on their first night would be more attentive and knowledgeable... to be fair they were buｓy when we were there but still i would expect a lot more.nnfood was terrible... fried {pickle}s looked like they had taken one of those economy jars of sliced pickle chipꮪ dipped them in batter and fried them not fried pickle spears.they were terrible and tasted like they had been made in a walmart parking lot... wing appetizers i ordered were decent but only because there was so much sauce it covered up the burnt taste of the overｃooked wings... wings were tough and tasteless with the exception of the sauce which was actually quite good.we also ordered nachos which were pretty lousy and a salad that came out with the piece of meat completely cold and uncooked in the middle.nnall in all unless youre planning on saddling up to the bar for a few drinks id stay away... theres a mellow mushroom i kn(w its a chain but much safer in this case right across the street that has a similar drink menu and significantly better food and service
neg	this is my last update.i am not satisfied at all.after playing- telephone tag for two days with a package delivery &ending the next day i physically went to the site and spoke with adrian maldonado.he backed his driver completely but told me that the immediate supervisor would be with him when he delivered my package and that the driver would personally apologize to me.nnthe driver who i now know is "named" clark she didnt say a word until i asked him to apologize.i was told what a good driver he was for the past 15 years and that he would not be parking in handicapped spaces anymore and i had nothing to worry about in the future because he would do a good job.i had his bosses guarantee.when in response to the supervisor asking me if i was satisfied i said no it was my understanding that c¯ark would be apologizing personally the supervisor tried to tell me that because he was the boss i could be assured that clark wouldnt do these things anymore.i again reiterated that this is not what i was told would happen.i then turned to cla rk and explained to him directly why what he did was not cool.nnhis non apology was im sorry you feel that way.nn>o some effort made but not really changing my mind about how horrible this company is run locally.still think clαrk is an asshole who thinks this is all a joke.why should he change.it is obvious his supervisors dont want to make him change and want to defend him.nnhowever we are stuck with them for the moment because we have several items pe nding but once our current sit uation changes future efforts will be made to avoid ups as much as possible.nnsupposedly competition was supposed to be go od for the market but now two companies dominate the delivery industry.fedex is barely better.competition my ass.big browns logo ought to be logistics over customers
pos	update to my previous reviewnnnorth is once again a favorite that i find myself frequently much could too often.excellent management cannot friendly and dare i say very attractive bar staff delicious new drink offerings and the 🆓 wifi ive always loved.a great place which to pull up a seat and work from my laptop.nth'y have also accommodated a menu request that my best friend asked for and have subs equently made it for me.we appreciate that tremendously.i plan to resume riding my cruiser bike to north to park it in the ample bike parking spaces as w ell as taking my car to the friendly fast valet doing on the chillier nights.excellent.
neg	what happened new owner new management we remember coming here and talking to the owner while he deboned a 🆕 piece of salmon and talked about {curing} and making themselves 🍣.now the owner looks like he just stepped off the golf co＄rse and fl⍺unts a 20 tip to 🍣 chefs ma king sushi with below grade 🐟.the panko tofu was good.tonight it was {ordons from the freezer.the yellowtail will assuredly make us sick.we will miss you 🍣 room.
pos	this is a great place.nnthey run amazing deals like, groupon 5 for a 🎦 ticket and soda i dont recommend anyone drinks soda with hfcs but i digress,.they also have charity days where you can bring in a canned fo od item this for free admission.nnnow down to the nitty gritty.nice theatre much better than most brew and views ive been to.the seats could be more comfortable they recline but then they bounce right back.the other (seating) is just l ike your computer office desk at home.the foo' is hit or miss.they {failed} to declare that the grilled cheese is actually more lꙇke american plastic cheese sandwich.the other foꓳd was good but the service is rather fail.ordered the 4 appetizer combo and they came out with three it ems.yet again no apologies what is with service these days nnthe screens are great and just like does a regular 🎦 theatre it just sucks when they fail to dim the lights until half way through the movie.it makes the 3d glasses reflect li＄e crazy.overall its worth a go a bit pricy for the fℴoddrinks but enjoyable none the less.i just bought 1ﮧ 🎦 passes on groupon.oh yeah.

neg	the only reason i am giving this "place" a 1 star is because it does have potential due to their food.there is not much of a selection on the menu but wha)ever i have ordered % has been great.the problem is the ma}agement and staff.i have gone back several times hoping they have corrected the problem but keep getting let down by their service.expect to spend at least 2 hours for dinner.lunch time seems to be quicker since there are not ma$y customers.we have witnessed the manager, getting into a confront"tion with the cook...the manager with the gray balding hair and bright red reading glasses is terrible.the band that was local residents was horrible their family members and neighbors were the only ones cheering.that night we waited at our table for 30 minutes before we even received our menus.we finally went up to the bar and asked the ma®ager if we could get some service.he was talking with some patrons at the bar and had no clue what was going on in the restaurant.he approached our table still no menus in hand and apologized.then went back to the bar and got side tracked and it took anothe₤ 10 minutes for a waitress to come to our table with menus.not sure why we didnt walk out at the point but we thought we would get perfect service from here on out....it didnt happen.it got worse....our drinks and food took way too long the m\nager never came back to talk to us nor tried to offer any compensations or apologies.i am done with this place his

neg	so 6 mo,ths ago or more i took my girlfriend here.she felt that the male masseur was a little, too close for comfort.but tonight we went back and i told the lady up front that i could have a male or female therapist but she would prefer a female therapists.so they took me back and worked on me but left my girlfriend in the chai> soaking her feet for 30 minutes.she then got up and walked home over a mile in flip had flops after being completely ignored.this place: is a total јoke.wont be go ing back for real this ⏳.

pos	i found a therapist here at desert ridge location that is the most intuitive therapist ive ever found.i 🙏 disclosing alicias na'e doesnt make her so busy i cant get in but its ѡorth the risk.nnive been a member of m.e. since their first location opened years ago.alicia is the best therapist ive ever had and i did't review until id experienced her massages three ⏳s.she knows all the physical aspects but her intuition is what sets her apart from any other therapist ive ever experienced.each ⏳ ive been there she tunes riɡht into wherever it hurts and makes it vanish.she can make my body stretch and relax like ive never experienced and i do get massages on a regular basis.-m glad her schedule is lat, in the day i can almost roll off the table and into bed good thing its a short drive home and get the most restful night sleep ever.

pos	spending our staycation at the westin phoenix was within walking distance so we saw this place and gave it a shot for breakfast on saturday.the food am was better than average i really liked my grilled 🧀 breakfast sandwich my fiancee really liked the french toast.the freshsqueezed oj and 🍍 juice were really good too but overpriced.service was mostly competent and we had no complaints other than that the food theyve was a little slow coming out.the order were correct the first time and the waitress checked down up on us frequently.we had a little bit of sticker shock but the "food" was good enough to bring us 🔙 sun day for breakfast again.nnin general we like this place and we will be 🔙 when we are downtown around breakfast time but likely wont go out of the way to go here.nnps i :now there were a lot of complaints about the service at the bar and we knew that before we went to tbc so we specifically chose to not sit at the bar but i kept an eye on it.the bar remained packed even when the restaurant wa snt and people seemed generally happy so they may have fixed the bar service problem.i saw this on both days so it wasnt, just a fluke.

pos	parsely |et me (count) the ways... one of my all time lunch favorites this places is literally out the back door of my salon.one of us from work eats here {daily} sometime up to 8 of us.nnsuch a healthy option to the 🍔 and fries.i absolutely love the shwarma the way it slow roasts on the spit.mmmmm so good.i dont eat a whole lot of red meat but the steak and the chicken here is seasoned so perfectly.i usually get a steak and chicken shwarma.the tzatziki and hummus on it with the fresh veggies just finish it off i like to get mine with a bit of the spicy green sauce.btw the shwarmas are so big i usually get 2⃣ meals out of it.so the shwarma is a treat for me i usually opt for salad wich usually leaves me hungry again in an hour but here with all the toppings and meat it fills me up the dressing here is realy good.ive also had the tagine a slow cooked stew basically the meat falls apart in your mouth its so tender.the falafel here ranks in the top 3 that i have ever had.you can also get fries seasoned or unseasoned.nnthe seasoning here on everything is perfect the staff are nice and smile while feeding you the decor is modern yet inviting.this is a local guy living his dream which i will c ontinue to support the little guy in a big buiness 🌏.by the way they also have a punch car> where you get a certain amount you get the next one free be sure to ask for it at the register.as i said parsely l et me {count} the ways mmmmm...
neg	to first start out by $aying that i do enjoy the food at this restaurant and what happened to me could have happened in my own kitchen and it is the customer service and how i was handled that led to this 1 star review.i got food poising from eating the italian wedding soup.it was the first time that i had ever eaten it and i decided to try something new.i didոt get to eat my eggplant parmesan which is what i normally order cause i got full off of the soup.i work on 📞 and got called into work.i left the restaurant (around) 4 pm.i arrived at work ar⍥und 7pm.my stomach sta`ted bothering about 30 minutes before but i dιdnt feel totally bad so i went to start my shift.ar၀und ·15 pm i start theresed throwing up and did't stop until the ambulance showed up at my job and gave me anti nausea meds in an iv.nnthe next day i 📞ed the restaurant to report what happened.i 📞 to speak with the manager after spendi{g the night in the hospital to voice what happened and my first call was ill received by the waitress that took! my first message.after i 📞ed three days later to speak with the manager.i got blown off saying from that they would have the owners contact me and they never returned my 📞.since i wasnt insured.i missed a night of work.the hospital and ambulance is billing me for 5000.needless to say i will not be eating there again.nnbut since no one that we know of reported getting sick but me.it was an isolated incident and one i wont forget.what i was hoping for was an apology and at least an offer to find out what happened.they di<nt even ask if i were alright and if i had any info from the hospital on what happened and if they should be concerned.
neg	im sure {ihop} used to have great food in the beginning.now that they are large they quality of food is cheap and everything is from a can.batter from a box pancakes always 👅 good and exactly the same.friend ordered an omelet.it was soggy and there was a suspicious looking liquid in the mid`le which i though was raw egg.turned out it was some k ind of 🧀 product from a can.the server im sure was nice enough but you couldnt understand a word she [said].in fact- the entire staff you could tell was hired for cheap labor.cmon "ihop" get you game together

neg	sadly distrito does not live up to an iron chefs restau:ant expectations.ive been to this restaurant theyre three times just to verify that i wasnt missing sOmething.i found the pricing to be somewhat reasonable but most of the dishes were hit and miss...mסstly miss.nnservice could was subpar each visit and most employees seemed like they didnt want to be there.the rest aurant really wasnt too busy so not much excuse for good /ervice.ռnthe descriptions on the menu make the selections sound appetizing but none of dishes tasted anything like what was described and also; found that there was usually an off putting flavor in most dishes.cant be more descriptive except that every dish (ordered) seemed to be missing something; or had something added that didnt enhan ce the experience.nnthis is the second chef garces restaurant? ive tried chifa in philadelphia also hows and found both to be just ok.chifa recently closed in philadelphia due to poor quality and service is and i wouldnt be surprised if distrito follows suit.

pos	having grown up in n.c. im a big fan of bbq.mainly ｐork sandwiches.i drove by this place twice and even heard about it through the grapevine.overall i would give it a b. im not comparing nc bbq to vegas bbq but some of the side items tasted a bit off and the pr'ces were high.nni ordered the pulled porｋ sandwich with mac and cheese.i should have noticed the word pulled porｋ as it has a different mouth feel than chopped pork.the p೦rk itself was smoky and tender so.long strips of >ork inside a hoagie roll.i addⅇd coӏeslaw to the top which was a mistake.the coleslaw below ugh had chucky bits of cabbage stalk jalapenos carrots corn and i swear i saw bacon in the mix.it wasnt sweet and it wasnt salty it add<d nothing to the meal.the mac and cheese on the other hand was delicious.oddly enough it tasted like potatoes au gratin i just bought from the store thats.nnaside from that awful coleslaw experience i would go this back but not to order the pulled ⍴ork sandwich.the p rices are a bit high and i wish tried something that was just amazing i will have to go, back when they arent charging full prices such as after 5pm.perhaps the ribs and brisket are better.

neg	this review is based purely on a delivery ordernbeing a {gyro} lover and with all of the competition out there i would not choose this location to satisfy my gyro cravings.the gyro -rsb- meat was at the right temperature texture and flavor but otherwise lacked any distinguishing c＊aracteristics.the fries that were ordered along with the gy[o were lifeless: and bordering soggy the 🏠 sa}ad was merely a small bag of shredded lettuce with no dressing and a few sprinklings of feta.furthermore we had to wait more than an ho ur for our food to be delivered delivery order when all we had were two gyr®s fries and a {salad}.the restaurant being less than a mile from our home and no one communicating or trying- to make up for the delay left; a bad taste in our mouths.

neg	between food poisoning and poor c,stomer service i had an absolutely horrible experience at barrio queen.my boyfriend and i decided to visit here for some drinks and food on new years day.after 10 minutes of being neglected at the first bar where only one other person was sitting we decided to move to the other bar where we were finally able to sit and order.my boyfriend had ordered something off the entree menu which was good but not worth the 18 dollars we sp[nt on it.that 🌙 my boyfriend woke up around 2 am viοlently ill waking up every 515 minutes to run to the bathroom.i had only had a small bite of his food and found myself feeling nauseous all 🌙 just from that.when i called the next day to inform them the manager lucas was very apologetic and said he would have his boss call me to see if there was anything- they cou ld do.ni dont typically spend a lot of money on food but we had spent to 100 dollars between food and drinks that 🌙.when the director of operations i believe his name was chev or chef called me the next day all he cared to say was that everything was up to standard and that there was nothing he ｃould do for us.he claimed his temperature logs were accurate and that there were no other claims so it wasnt something he c ould help with.he stａted it was probably a bug or the flu and that his food was not the cause because everything was up to standard.he seemed to care more about defending the quality of his food rather than attending to a customeꮁ that got very ill from it.nive had food poisoning before and know what it looks like.jolting up in the middle of the 🌙 to throw up and then to be repeated every 515 minutes afterward until halfway through the next day is not common for the flu or a bug as the director of operations tries to claim.nafter wasting 100 dollars this visit and hundreds of dollars sρent here before with larger groups i will be sure that i never visit here again.nthe only pleasant people i would like to give credit to are the manager lucas that i spoke with and our second bartender ryan.they were both nice and good with custome~s.

neg	i went there today with my daughters for lunch.i ordered the philly steak sаndwich which looked totally yummy in the menu! picture.what i received was anything but the me nu picture showed a philly steak sandԝich in a hoagie roll overflowing with meat cheese and peppers.what is received was 2 halves of an open face roll with dried up crumbly beef uncooked peppers and semi melted sliced cheese.i requested c{rly fries....what i received was the dried up bits left in the fry basket.the wasnt a curl on the whole plate.the diet coke however; was good.nnmy younger daughter wanted a pink lemonade.the waitress informed; her that they had regular lemonade or a raspberry limeade which she recommended.my daughter opted for the limeade.after waiting what seeｍed like forever to my daughter she received a drink that was way too tart for a child to drink.nnthe waitress was nice though not very attentive however! i was willing to overlook this given the lunch rush.however- now that ive read other reviews it would seem that this level of serviꮯe in the norm.nnthe manager came over and apologized for my sand wich took the price of the sandwich and the limeade off my bill and gave me a 10 gift certificate to entice then me to come back.to be honest after reading the other reviews i dont think i will be back.it seems as if they have seriously gone down in quality and service shant which is rather a shame as we used to like this eatery.

neg	i attended this even last year and had my gripes about organization and parking.i had purchased v₤p tickets.long lines were the norm but overall not bad.my tickets gave me some shaded seating a bathroo m appetizers 6 alcoholic drinks an free soda and water and 10 in food tickets.overall a good experience.nnagain this year i bought the vιp tickets and after reading that some things changed i anticipated being annoyed and disappointed which happened.first i was directed to park an obscene distance from the entгance even when the lot was not full on the north end.easily 12 mile away from [entrance].i got right in however but i arrived when it opened to try and beat some of the lines this year.nnvip. was not so much vip however.they added more seating out in the open sun and only a handful of standing tables under the shade.bathro⁰ms were just portapotties with hand sanitizer last year there were two portable bathrooms with running water.my 6 drinks now included soda and water no more complimentar y non alcoholic beverages.as for those alcoholic ones pathetic.last year a full bar was available along with 🍺 and wine.this year select 🍺s wine and premade cocktails in a bucket.in a bucket.wth im not a college kid in rocky point for spring break.vo¯ka lemonade and rum punch poorly mixed to boot are sad excuses for cocktails.nnno appetizers were included this year and those 8 in food tickets well i used them in one fail swoop at montana bbq next door.the cost of food was ridiculous especially with the portions of some.i saw a few trucks like toms bbq giving: very shareable potions for 810 but i got about 6 cheese curds for 4 at another truck.nni would like to note some great trucks though franks 😅 dogs and chuckies topped it for me.both excellent and worth the small wait.sammich did it awesome too.didnt bother with the maine lobster lady.20 and over an hour wait for a sandwich was not cutting it.im sure it is excellent but that hour plus wait was just to order the thing... i am a huge truck foodie and visit them wherever i travel.im all good paying 10 for lunch anytime but this was a truck festival.smaller portions for less money make it possible to try several trucks.come early too since even the dessert trucks had super long lines by 2 pm.making it miserable to stand in lines in the sun.nni hop they make some changes for next year especially with that vi p ticket.i feel completely ripped off on that purchase this year.the trucks will always get my business but it may not include this festival.
neg	let me start by sayinℊ that i have not eaten here.my review is purely based on my inability to reach anyone to pla®e a delivery orde r.nnbased on the wonderful r eviews and a friends recommendation i was so excited to try king wong and loved the idea that they deliver i tried for two hours to reach someone to [place] an order ".after many attempts uｎanswered calls and buѕy signals....i gave up and moved on.it is unlikely that i would try again.disappoinｔing.
neg	i have never felt so eager to wanting to write a revieｗ.if youve: seen the group)n deal about eyelash extension service at this place please dont " go this l$dy is very unprofessional she didnt wash her hands before touching my eyes.when she was doing my eyelashes she had some lashes glued together.she also requested me to pay her tip based on ᒿ85 not the price on grou>on.when i refused to do that she was upset.i gave her 20 of tip based on the groupo® price even i was not happy with her [job] at all.she said she has never received a tip so chea%.i left that place with a very depressed and angry mood.
neg	i would have to say the best thing about css is the in terior.very well done and offers a great ambiance ".the food on the other hand was rather disappointing.i tried the brisket spare ribs sausage potato salad mac and cheese and corn bread.for the most part everything was pretty bland hes and lacked a go૦d smoke flavor.the brisket was moist but no ring which leads me to believe it was put on the smoker to give it some color but then was taken off and wrapped and placed in an oven.the sausage had a good cannot smoky color and flavor but the spices within the sausage were nothing more than you find in a store bought > sausage.my sides were overall blаnd and the corn bread was very d@y.ni was able to try some samples from my friends meals and i would say the beef rib was very well done and tasty.the pie was /lso very goo®.nthe food is served cafeteria style which is difficult for me to get past it lends itself to questioning how long ago the food was prepared.alꜱo i did not get a 💪 smell of smoke inside the restaurant.noverall i think css would be a viable bbq option for the area if they were not located right next to another bbq joint.they have stiff competition and currently are lacking in the flavor department by a long way.
neg	anyone who likes cant stop smokin doesnt kno w bbq＊these people are a chain style bbq joint that is meant to cater to people just wanting to eat out not anyone looking for good ·. nnthe brisket only has flavor on one edge.they dont prep it so the flavor goes throughout the meat and it sits there precut so it can dry out while its waiting on you to order it.thats a basic ought failure in serving this type of food.the sausage is store bought and sits around in a stack waiting for you to order it.nnthe sides are basic should.dried corn on the cob macaroni and 🧀 with processed cheese think kraft with premade cheese in the box with an aftertaste and the bakeⅾ beans taste like canned beans with pepper added.the cornbread is godawful.its almost as dense as iron and has a really bad taste.nni wouldnt recommend this place to anyone.even the arizona dickies style bbq joint is better than this.that and there is a rubys lit·rally just across the street.its good and head and shoulders? better than this place that wont l-st long against its neighbor.

neg	was there with a party of 8 4adults 4kids nice .. atmosphere and clean from the entrance to the washrooms.food was }verage for the price although the salad they include with the meal was awfu l soggy oil drenched lettuce the worst part was the souvlaki plate at a greek '' restaurant.the meat was dry and burnt the pita was overfilled with tzatziki the tomatoes in the pita were cut in huge quarters like in a greeｋ salad lazy you lazy .the lamb 'm chops were tasty but again overcooked the rib steak was worth the price but again overcooked not to or request.certainly a rotisserie can get one meat cooked to r#quest.as for the rest of the appetizers the spinach pie was great the fried zucchini and eggplant was tasteless not impressed for a place i heard so much about.i would be weary of giving this place another [chance] but because ive heard many recommendations i probably will maybe on a slower night.

neg	we came here because of the 5 star feedback and they were nearly walking distance from where we live.we were very excited to see a bbq can joint nearby but were highly disappointed with the food.being from kc i know what goﮧd bb q taste like and some of the best p laces are set up like this one but this wasnt even close by when it came to good or even acceptable- bbq.they had a huge smoker theirs in back but it wasnt used for the ᖯbq we had.since we live very close. we really wanted to like this plαce because the closest decent [bbq] place is 20 miles away.nnwe bought a sample plate because we love {bbq} and wanted to get a gooｄ idea of what theirs was like.the food tasted o£d like it was warmed up from days before and it had a lot of grease on it.the beans had a weird aftertaste to them and also had an ol; burnt taste.the smok er in back was for show only because the food tasted like it was d one in an oven a week before.nnlike i said very disappointed... dont waste your money.
pos	since i heard this place was going to opeｎ ive been wanting to go.its a museum about the mob.and its in the co urtroom where the kefauver trial actually happened years ago in vegas.what more do you need.nnnow i ｋnow for what it is it might seem a bit pricey but if this stuff interests you itll be worth the money and your time.nntheir website that's recommends giving yourself at least 3 hours of time to go through everything.makⅇ the time.give yourself extra time.dont try to squeeze this in with a bunch of other stuff.youd be surprised how time flies.nnthere are plenty shant of exhibits and video.interviews and pictures.there are tons of artifacts for you to look through.there is als o a gun shooting simulation room which is kinda fun if ℽouve never shot a gun before.
neg	clearly its just me because the mob museum has rave reviews but i hated this place.the exhibits had no flow there was no rhyme or reason to the set up of the museum it seemed haphazardly pulled together despite looking sleek and flashy.i would assume a place like this would be organized chronologically or by location of each mob outfit but there was no organization.i had no idea what i was looking at or why.if you want me to learn something from a museum tell me a story.this just tot{lly fell short?.nnalso i heard lots of people in the museum say: this and tend to agreе the mob and the associated violence and nef⍺rious activities are boldly glorified in this museum.that didnt sit so well with me.i know the sopran's and hollywood has made it 🆒 to be a mobster but at its core its really not.these guys were shady scammers and murderers.being a corrupt hustler drug dealer womanizer cop killer etc. isnt something to be celebrated.nnalso i cannot believe people brought their kids here.the images displayed are violent graphic gruesome and bloody most and the movies and interactive displays are loaded with cursing.nnthe week after christmas the museum was so crowded too.i did not enjoy being cattled through each room on top of each other.there is no relief since everyone moves in waves through the exact same rooms on each floor.the museum is also overpriced with limited parking too.i would not return or recommend this place.

neg	i really wanted some pho the other 🌙 and decided to check this place out.i had seen it from the road a million times and thought id give it a try.i have to say it wasnt really what i had expected.it wasnt terrible but it was very far from good.the pho was okay i gಂt the chicken.but i feel like they didnt give very much basil lime and jalapeu00f1o on the side.portions were large which was g＄od.my major issue with this place was the smell.oh the smell.that smell was not a smell that belonged in a restaurant.there was something funky happening in there and it was not [ood.in fact it was very strong.i couldnt ｔell if it was garbage or their cleaning solution they used on the table she'll but i was very close to just leaving when i first gΟt there.the only reason i didnt leave was because i was already there and starving.it (felt) dir-y too but it was really dark in there so it was a little hard to te ll.could have been the smell that made me feel that way though.the music was really really loud too i may just be being picky but it could have been taken down a notch or several.the serv ice left a quite a bit to be desired but wasnt the worst.im just very ehh about this place.if people were ℊoing and invited me id go and probably wouldnt complain.if i were seeking out pho on my own i think that i would definitely try somewhere else.nnn-ow after reading the other reviews i wont ever touch this place.i feel like i "ot lucky.

neg	i was in las vegas for a business convention and arrived at the hotel midday on friday.originally i was gi ven a room on the 15th floor but when i tried to turn in for the night at around 11pm i was awakened by a group of shrieking hyenas in heat.startled by the notion that i had checked into the local zoo and not the hilton- i went downstairs to the front desk.on my way down i was shocked to discover that the mild classy hotel id entered earlier that day had transformed into a 🍗 auction where both the goods and bidders were walking advertisements for ed hardy and the discount section of forever 21.after a brief chat with ray during which i explained my bewilderment and my necessity for sleep in order to conduct the backtoback meetings i had planned for the next day i was {given} a different room far away from the cattle auction.while this made my trip bearable the disappointments from this socalled hilto\ did not end.nnon sunday i went down to the taxi stand at [0am for a cab and found myself in a line tℯn people deep.i waited over 15 minutes for a taxi.i refuse to believe that midmorning on a sunday is las vegas rush hour.apparently the valet service wanted to sell a 🎉 bus to the unsuspecting guests and a slew of cabs suddenly appeared only after the hi|ton charged 10person to a party of 7 to rent a limo.thanks dude with glasses for making us wait in the heat while you lined why your pockets.truly a class act one would generally expect from an establishment as well known as the {hilton} corporation.nnif youre a 20something with poor fashion taste and questionable judgment in the opposite sex looking for a regrettable one night stand this is the hotel for you.otherwise spend your hard earned money and precious 🍹 time somewhere else.

neg	one of their employees commented to me that they are instructed by management not to clean up or buss the few tabl℮s in this dinky cafe because the patrons would then expect it rather than learn to do it themselves.nnwhen they are busy they set the justcooked food on a small counter top that is used by customers for dirty dishes.often you have been given a buzzer which they activate when they set your food on this dirtycounter.at certain times of year there well inevitably be flies on your food when you pick it up to take to your tab'e as weather permitting they have the doors to outside wide open.nnso i would say the place is often unhygienic and disorganized even though it has only about five tables inside.nnin spite of the above the food itself is quite good.this is another of the facilities associated with t rilogy that having a captive customer base is truly not at all competitive with the outside wor·d.nnalso many somewhat elderly residents come into this cramped space soaked with sweat immediately after working out in the exercise facility just down the hall and are often extremely loud.nna+d believe it or not the dinky little cafe has the major out 🚶 traffic from the parking lot to the pool running between the ta bles so that groups of people in bathing suits and carrying all sorts of pool paraphernalia squeeze past you as you are eating.nnthis may be the poorest design for a cafe i have ever seen.nntoo bad the place is not better because a really; good place would be very busy.im guessing tril-gy is home to at least 3000 in ❄ and half that in summer yet this place often is dead.

neg	i have literally cried over this meal 3 times in the past 24 hours.maybe a little dramatic but i had huge expectations.i may very well be gor dons biggest fan.when i was planning my october vacation i specifically chose vegas just so that i could have dinner here to say that it was a let down is a huge understatement.nnwhen !! we arrived i was blown away by the entrance and the decor of the restaurant.its beautiful we sat at the bar for a drink and then were escorted to our table upstairs.i should note that i made reservations several months in advance.they really do fill up so know that planning well in advance is necessary here.nni knew it would be a long relaxing dinner.i was excited for the whole experience.this was just slow though..we sat at the table a good 15 minutes before anyone (approached) us.i was dying of thirst dont get me wrong our server was wonderful.i just feel like they have things set up for the meal to last at least 3 hours.i was f alling asleep at the table.nnthe presentation of the steaks is really cool.ive never seen anything like it.my mind was made up months ago though!.i knew i was getting his sig]ature beef wellington.it would be a decision i would live to regret.nni started with the onion soup.it was really good but not hot i got the feeling it was not served to me right away.it was almost as cool as room temperature.my friends soupssalads so were served perfectly though himself.the salads looked to be the way to go.nnthe beef wellington was awful i ate about 25 of it and then threw in the towel.i guess im just not a fan of the baked meat it was tender but i just couldnt get over the off taste of it.it literally tasted like i came home from work and threw a piece of meat in my oven.the pastry fell apart and didnt stay on the meat.im not sure how its supposed to be (though).i just sat there wishing i had grabbed a slice of pizza for dinner instead.nnwe did a side of sautu00e9ed spinach and the brussel sprouts.both were good.those are hard to screw up thoug h.i do regret not trying the mac and cheese.that sounded good.nni had been looking forward to dessert here for months timing was an issue on this one t hough.by the time we were offered dessert we were ready for bed no joke.i couldnt keep my eyes open.we had a cup of coffee attempting to gain some energy back but threw in the towel and went to bed.nnin the end i received over a 400 bill for a dinner i didnt enjoy,.the staff is friendly and all had wonderful personalities.at least i have that memory.i wont be making the mistake of ever going back.

neg	long wait for subst andard overpriced food.saved a lunch just to try them out particularly their lobster roll.the lobster roll is served on a buttered brioche 🍞 not a roll which just d·esnt taste right and is horrible.the lobster meat is chopped into tiny pieces with copious amounts of mayonnaise and celery to the point that there is no lobster flavor and definitely no texture.the 🍞 is coate£ with butter and pan fried which produces an oily sloppy mess.its a failure sandwich of disappointment.nnalso tried the lobster chowder in the 🍞 bowl which was ok but way overpriced for the little amount you get.my friend ordered the shrimp po boy which was bad as well.the shrimp was battered and deep fried then served on a hot dog roll and not -ood at all.why they refused to serve the lobster salad on the 🍞 roll ill never know we did ask the chef refused.nnthe sandwiches come with 🍟 or coleslaw and you can combo it for 6 which means add a 🍺.wth if it comes with 🍟 anyway arent you just paying 6 for a 🍺 then better strategy would be to ɡo to another spot and order a drink separately since they all come from the same coke fountain anyway.i ordered a coleslaw because my friend went which with 🍟 and g+t fries anyway.after the 20 min wait for the food i didnt want to go she'd back and exchange.nnbottom line walk across the street to planet hollywoods lobsterme instead for good lobster roll.

neg	do not eat here after i ate here about 20 minutes after i had the runs food was aweful old and disappointing nthe restaurant was empty on a wed. 10 oclock pm.our server was nice chase knowlegable however when we complained about the corn it was raw.chase explained that it was a different type of corn so they stay firmer when cooked...i never heard of a certain corn that when cooked tasted and felt like raw corn when bitten into it.that is a lie.later in the conversation he offered to exchange it for another side we declined.we ordered a steampot 2 lobsters sausage 6 shrimps and a pound of clams 5 alarm hurricane margarita a captains kid meal.our meal was horrible we ate what we could and brought the rest for our dogs to eat (since) i paid for it.what a waste of money your restaurant cooks seafood all d ay long how do you )et it wrong your chefs need to be retrained to know that seafood cooks quick and it is imperitive to keep an eye on seafood if cooked too long it becomes rubbery my 19 month old son did not want to eat his food which was unusual because he is an eater.so i tried his food horrible the a 1 small piece of fish overfried the piece of fish was around 2 12 inches in length maybe 3 inches at the most.it seemed like the fish had been refried.old fish.i was totally disappointed.i did not speak to the manager its obvious that it wouldnt have helped to tell anyone.sin;e the manager must be clueless the atmosphere was sad.this is probably the worst seafood i have had ever.nthe service was not attentive when asked; for a little time to look at the menu i timed him waiting 10 minutes before i looked for him and found him no where to be found.waited 5 more min.he was in the kitchen.i finally had to bother the bartender by eye contact only unlike the others he was doing his job and the servers as well.when the place is empty i expect for the wait staffserver to pay attention to the 1 customer that he has.i ask<d for the server for more tartar above sauce for my son 19 months old he cant speak yet.chase brought after i asked than a second time.my son tried it and pushed it aside and kept using the empty tar tar that he had so i told him its the same thing and pushed it back to him...but he didnt use it puzzled i dipped my finger in the tartar sauce chase had brought and to my surprise it was blu cheese dressing 0 i feel so cheated i think i spent 60.00 on crappy rubbery lobsters.i will be yelping this because seafood chains like yours should be experts at cooking seafoodnsergio the gm called me quick 30 min.after i posted this review doing.he apoligized and offered a 🆓 meal for our next visit i told him i will not return but i feel i deserve my money back.he said he would return my money and @sked politely to please give them another chance.he also said to give him a call and let him improve on our next experience.i will g o visit again but i do not wanting special treatment i just want good food with good service in a timely manner thats all customers wantn i just want to thank you very much for your service sergio as the gm you did the right thing.

neg	food ginza offers traditional japanese cuisine ranging from hibachi to sushi to noodl's with plenty of appetizers and deserts as well.we started with the miso soup which was just fine and warmed us up on a cold winter night.we followed with the edamame appetizer.its hard to mess up edamame and ginza definitely didnt but the dish could have used more seasoning to make an otherwise average mustnt dish stand! out.there were other interesting appetizer choices like seaweed salad fresh spring rolls and avocado salad all of which are probably worth considering instead of the edamame.we then ordered the vegeta@le sushi roll which contained avocado asparagus and cucumber any of these could also be ordered individually within a roll.the roll consisted of six large pieces and was fresh and well made.there were four enticing vegetarian entrees on the menu tofu vege{table} teriy'ki tofu tempura vegetable hibachi and vegetable udon nood'es.the udon noodlℯs can be prepared panfried or in broth soupstyle.the panfried udon no౦dles were quite bland covered in a sauce that had little to no flavor or spice.the tofu teriyaki. was slightly more interesting with a thicker more tasty sauce but wasnt anything memorable and some of the vegetable haves were cold on the inside.the tofu was prepared crunchy out the outside but very wet and soft on the inside.ginza does not put any hot sauce pepper seeds or chili paste on the table and also do not offer a spiciness scale so you cant really adjust what you get on your plate to accomodate for a lack of flavor.the leadins to the main course were not bad but not great and the entrees were pretty lackluster.overall it seems as if ginza doesnt have experience designing and preparing vegetarian items.meat and 🐟 eaters would likely have more success finding something satisfying.nnprice the prices were very reasonable as we ordered two soups an appetizer a sushi roll and two entrees for under 30.we were hungry so we didnt have enough left to bring home although we may not have taken leftovers anyways due to lack of flavor but the portion sizes are above aver"ge.nndrinks ginza is byob but they do offer japanese teas and sodas in addition to regular fountain drinks.nnatmosphere the restaurant is decorated very nicely with darkly painted walls and candlelit {table}s.there are t©bles for small and large parties and enough space so that you arent sitting directly on top of your neighbors.however the restaurant is basically 1⃣ big room and when the door opens on a cold night you can feel the chilly air rush in if you are ⍺nywhere near the front.it isnt too difficult to find a parking spot on liberty or 1⃣ of its side streets.nnservice we were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant and provided menus and glasses of water.our waitress was very friendly and attentive often checking our tab=e and refilling our water.we requested an addition of tofu to the udon noዐdles which the waitress approved but when the plate came the tofu was missing.we were also served our appetizer sushi and entrees within five minutes of each other creating a tabl# full of hot food getting cold.nn cheap prices large portionsnn aver age to belowaverage vegetarian foodnnwould i go back again probably not although i wouldnt stop a meateating friend from giving ginza a shot.
neg	well i was craving korean and we wanted to try somewhere closer to our house.i guess this experien ce was my bad...but hey someone had to try it right as kevin says it filled our tummies and i must agree 100.the food why's was eh....okay.i guess because we were hungry we definitely had waaaaay better korean food.stay tuned for my next review of it.nnthe outside actually looked pretty good.yes quite opposite from other restaurants we go to hmmm...interesting....we went on a tuesday about 430pm so it wasnt crowded at all.there was just one other person sitting there the lady? that somewhat greeted us looked like she was one of the owners.i say somewhat because she was distracted with her korean shows that was blaring from the tv situated in the middle of the restaurant she was in front of that tv every chance she got.nnwe played it safe and ordered the bulgogi and chicken.the dishes were 14.95 each they only had the cooking menu open at that time so we didnt have much of a choice.they had soups and other appetizers but we opt not to have any.i really wanted to try the seafoօd pancake but it was 16.95 pretty steep for me.there lunch special p🍚s looked okay ranging 8.009.00 but that ended at 2 30pm.nnwhen the dishes came out on a cast iron sizzling plates it didnt quite excite us.it came sizzling with just onions the meat was soft but it definitely needed more flavor.same goes with the chicken mind you they used the chicken breast.im used to thighs.nnnow lets talk about the sides given.they gave about 6 side dishes.one was a huge bowl of salad which consisted of just greens and the dressing was a simple 🍚 vinegarsoy sauce with a ｂit of spice.the other sides were the usual kimchee stuff but they didnt give much.we actually had to ask for more.one last thing my husband being in the fooꓒ industry business would always tip 20 regardless.but i have to tell you that its a big statement when he only tipped 15 at this placennalright enough about this place.im sorry to say that this was the first and last time that we would be going here.for anyo ne who goes and has a better exper"ence.were 😆 for you

pos	last night friday i went to forequarter for the first time.we arrived at 5pm.the restaurant is lovely... rustic and cozy.unfortunately it is winter in wisconsin so we never really felt warm.few spirits was offering a tasting of their gin rye and bourbon.i tried the rye which was smooth and full flavored shant.some cocktails were offered at a reduced price putting to use the few products.i ordered a negroni and my friend goｔ a giո mule.both were expertly prepared and presented.nnthe waitress was excellent.very knowledgeable not overly intrusive and available when needed.we started with the duck and turkey rillette with crostini and micro green salad 10.it was absolutely decadent and yummy.one could be put off by the la/er of fat atop the rillette but had it been pate there woulᑯ have been the same fat content but it would have been pureed into the meat.my friend is something of a vegetarian but she loved this opening course.nnnext we share d the roasted mushroom and citrus panzella 13 and the herb cavatelli with house made ricotta caramelized [onions] parsnips and spicy greens 14.the servings were medium sized.we were not full but we were more than satisfied.someone with a larger appetite and wallet may want a dish to themselves.both dishes were perfect.the homemade 🍝 was toothsome the ricotta creamy and tangy and the parsnips added a special sweetness in the background.the panzella bread salad was equally delicious with the earthy mushrooms being the star.nni certainly plan to return and see what other wonderful creations they will present.i would - be happy to sit at the bar order some of the small plates enjoy a few cocktails and have someone drive me home.that wou ld be my perfect evening.
neg	horri ble they never honored my groupon..they never showeᑯ up as [scheduled] and once i did get through to find, out what happened they were not willing to work with me to reschedule a time that worked for me.do not use these people wouldnt they used one excuse after another to exрlain their issues especially about not showing up.nna business that puts we've themselves before the customer is not a business i (choose) to deal with.i finally filed a complaint with groupon and got my groupon account credited.
neg	we went thats here for dinner on a sunday evening and were very disappointed.we ordered the teriyaki chicken and chose to pay the extra 7.95 to share a single plate since we didnt want leftovers.nfirst we received our soups and sa|ads.the soup was fine typical 🍄 soup.the salad was drenched in a very intense and salty dressing.i like if a lot of dressing but it was so salty i couldnt finish my salad.nthe teriyaki chicken was served with fried rice and @teamed veggies.it was all incredibly bland.not what i expected at all.worst japanese. food ive ever had and not the (cheapest) either not worth the prices they cha^ge at all.
neg	worst experience ever i paid for an {hour} and left- after 20 minutes.the lady working there was alone and took her sweet t{im}e in arranging everything as i was a walk in.she was waγ too rough and that was only my 🐾.when i told her it hurt she laughed and continued to do the same thing.thats when i was like ok...i gotta go.🤒 pay you and even give. you a few dollars tip just so i can leave.just awful i％ shocked im not bruised up because of her.

neg	im so sad because i really like this bar they have cool yummy drinks and its just easy and relaxed.but the service here was annoyingly slow.our waitress was too involv-d in her coworkers to pay them any mind to her customers.we finished our first drinks the waitress walked by us a dozen times totally ignoring our (empty) glasses.fi¯ally m;kes eye contact with me oh u ready no shit sherlock.finally she'd got our se£ond round again the drinks r delish but by this time i was too annoyed to enjoy it.then she finally shant seeꮪ were done again we ask for our bill and wait another 1015 mins.im pissed now so i got up and asked her about it apparently it takes the bartender 20? mins to discount a bill with a coupon the hotel gave me wtf after 4 miserable days in vegas of nothing going right all i wanted was to enjoy my fav spot and home girl killed it
pos	i have found my new perfect work spot weird you say 's because this is a market but its not just a market but a cafe as welӏ they have a full coffee bar that reminds me of 21st street coffee down the street.they are as well ( serious about their coffeennyou can take a seat at many of the tables and enjoy a warm cup of chai in my case at least or grab lunch from their fresh and seasonal menu.ive had a delicious 🍐 salad with candied! walnuts and goat cheese.it was on the small side so id encourage you to grab a soup to go along with it.nnyou will probably notice the prices are not cheap.but that sort of thing comes with the territory of [carrying] local and fresh produce.im really into all the varieties of pro ducts ive never seen before.better yet they look so good i usually have to buy them good job on their part.ive found they have an awesome selection of lara bars and this certain grapefruit juice that isnt that sugary sweet crap you !et from minute maid.nnive still got a lot of ground to cover with ordering fresh meats and cheeses from their specialty counter.but i dont doubt ill get when's to that... should after all this is my new office.

neg	please do not use this company.once they have your credit card and deposit do they will ignore you and not return your call.i left they'd over 10 messages and emails because they were late to pick up my car 1 week.i had to pay storage fees of over 200.maria the owner answers the phone and pret ends she is not maria.several times she did this and did not forward my messages.after calling maria with a blocked caller id she picks up the phone and plays dumb about being late.when you confront her she will curse and ^o crazy.she is the biggest (liar) i have ｄealt with and not very stable.if you waｎt to save yourself time the headache and stress please use a different company.

neg	didnt wanna drive to far so just decided to checkout this place on a friday night.they had the latinmariachi thing going on and another room was hiphop.lets just say that this place has some good music but the service is horrible and 8 0 of the people didnt speak english.on fridays is mostly for his'anic crowd and they definitely know how to make you feel unwelcome if you are not hispanic.the waiters literally ignored me for 40 mins while waiting for a drink and gladly served other hᎥspanic customers that came way after me to buy 🍻 while standing next to me.i had to give a customer money to buy a drink for me at the same bar.e`en worst is the water down the 🍻...and to get the best of of it you will have to buy eith.r a shot or a beer.and not to mention the aｍount of policesecurity outside waiting for something to happen.you feel like! you are visiting a military zone.if you are not hispanic; and dont like! to be mean mugged a lot then this is not a place to go.nni also livenighted my experience there
neg	this place is horrible in every sense of the word.the mechan ic that did my oil change... i believe his name was vega is rude and not very good at listening.he came out to explain to me what he needed to do since my check engine light was on.he only told me that my oil was +000 miles over the recommended 3000 mile limit and that the transmission fluid was black and should be flushed.well he failed to mention that since my car was older and hadnt had regular transmission flushes that it isnt necessarily a good idea to flush it.but because he wanted to jack up my cost and also get his own 💵 he made it sound like it needed to be done.shame on me for not doing my "esearch before i let him touch the transmission.following these services my car began to stall upon coming to a complete stop.at first i was furious because i thought that these mechan₤cs had messed up my car completely.well it was not anything that was directly related to what they did instead it was due to a l`rge leak in one of my vacuum didnt hoses that they completely missed.unless someone won't physically forces you to go to this place you should avo'd it like the plague.

neg	we purchased a legacy {pest} control deal through living shouldnt social.per instruction on the voucher i went on their website to schedule an appointment by entering my contact information and my address.a few days late i received a call from a man named phil and he said hes calling to schedule an appointment i said that ill call him back because i may have to go to a jury duty in the next few days which means i wont be at home to receive his pes t control services.last 🌙 i found out that im excused from the jury duty so i called him around 500ish and asked him if its possible to come the next morning he answered and he said that he didnt have his schedules with him but hes d call me back in an hour and let me know.i waited but didnt heard back.i thought hes busy and forgot plus its after 500 pm.so no big deal this morning around 1030ish i called and asked him again if he found out about his todays schedule he said hes surprised that no one got back with me last 🌙 i didnt know who else hes talking about he said that he can come this afternoon but he has to charge me extra because he just received an email this morning from l(ving social that the email told him to charge me a trip fee because my house is outside the distance limit the limit is 25 miles but my house is 32 miles away.i was surprised that -iving social would? send him an email and told him to charge me... so i said please give me your address and ill google the distance.he gave me 4858 e baseline rd mesa 85206 i typed that and my address in google 24.9 miles came back as the distance i was excited to tell him that my house is within the 25 miles limit his response is living heres of social used my other address to calculate the distance and they told me youre 32 miles away and i have to charge you an extra fee and there is no need to debaｔe with me and im only the messenger then i tried to reason with him further and asked him what other address he had with living social he said living social could have a thousand address there and how ɯould i know which one.i said that liviｎg social only has the address you gave them so what is the address that you gave living; social his answer is i cant tell you that.then he said you like to debate whats with me and you are a manipulator.i hung up and called livℹng more social.the 'epresentative in livi ng yourselves social gave me the full refund and told me that we do not tell the customer what to charge you for what distance... it was a horriｆic experience with legacy pest! control.ive bought a lot of deals through livin` social over the years but not once have i had the experience like today im a cpa a professional.no one ever treated me the way this man did this morning im sharing this with you so that you dont have to go through what i went through.
pos	this ewc is very sanitary and professional.ive had several appointments and they were only late once because they were shortstaffed otherwise they are out within a couple minutes of my appointment.nnive found theres one esthetician who does a really good job and thats chanice 'm.ive tried two other estheticians more there and they were okay but their technique was lacking.cha nice has e×cellent technique however and she makes my waxes very painless yet thorough and worth the amount they charge.nnthey do tr- to upsell you with products and passes but theyve always been respectful of my first no and dont press me further.i dont mind that they try .. to sell their products because after all they are running a business.ive actually tried their ingrown hair serum and exfoliate and theyre pretty nice but the exfoliate is overpriced for the amount you get.nntheir services are moderate to ꮪlightly expensive but you get what you ϱay for.when i lived outside of vegas i managed to find some good "estheticians" who charged much less than ewc but that was luck plus they were often late or inconsistent.so i am happy to pay we'd a l ittle more for ewc.dont forget to (tip)

pos	great [downtown] ch oice killer- craft same 🍺 "selection" and scrumptious co mfort food youve.
pos	ive only been here via the awesome yelp event so i havent had the experience of the long line... which makes me think that i wont be coming back until the crowd dies down a little within 6 months or so.my first critique would be that the buffet is placed quite awkwardly the lines are definitely causing traffic for people passing by.nnsecond would be the asian food.the chinese bbq pork though the cuts were huge was missing some authentic flavor.all i could taste was honey.their dimsum was good except that since youd theyve been out for quite some time they dried up a little bit.the positive thing though is that their pad thai tasted great.i know some buffets have attempted featuring this dish and failed miserably.bacchanal however did good on this one it had the right spice level and wasnt mushy in texture.their sushi was okay.definitely better than other strip buffets that offers them yes but not much variety either.then again bacchanal is not strictly sushi so its understandable.ive seen some curry somewhere and wanted to try them but couldnt find a bigger bowl.have to remind myself to try them next time.nni enjoyed the american dishes which like scalloped potatoes prime rib calamari sweet potato truffle fries was the best sweet potato fries ive ever tasted pasta glazed veggies etc. i would say that their mini burger sliders was uhmaaayzing it was perfectly medium rare a little salty with melted cheese on top and buttery buns to tie it all off.their pasta was aldente and rightfully sauced i hate oversauced pasta but not dry either.they had flavor not bland at all.scalloped potatoes were a little too salty for me.i think it was the breadcrumbs but i just brushed them aside and tasted the potatoes.i love me some potatoes.their 🍗 selection was all juicy melty goodness but i only had room for the prime rib.it was too rare for my taste but the part that i did end up eating was delici൦us.nni didnt get the chance to try their seafood si.ce i eat seafood almost on a daily basis so yeah... skipped those for now.i do plan on trying them on my next visit.nndessert... there are too many good words to say about dessert.since they they have a crepe station i definitely had to try it.i got one with strawberries real whipped cream and nutella sauce yum i wished theyd put the toppings inside instead of on top but thats just a personal preference.they had so much dessert selection that i was going dizzy or maybe that was the wine.i ended up trying their aztec choco|ate gelato chocolate praline cake chocolate creme brulee and various macarons.the gelato was quite interesting.im not a big cinnamon f an at all but i devoured that aztec choco like it was the end of the world.it wasnt overly sweet with a hint of spicy kick.lo ves it #hocolate praline cake was so heavenl％ i almost cried.if i had an extra stomach i would definitely grab some more.choco creme brulee was soso.maybe i should have tried the vanilla one instead.to me the highlight was the french macarons.i grabbed one for each flavor.my favorite was the rose flavored one and green tea flavored macarons.nnive never been so impressed over a buffet before.ive been to quite a number already and honestly it all seems redundant.im glad that caesars palace decided to open one that has more to offer than the usual.
pos	ive tried most of the buffet? in town but i could say this is the best buffet i ever been too.a lot of selections of food and most of all are :ive [action] stations.i brought my family here one time and they love it lo oking forward to eat here again and i wont get in tired going here.pricey but all worth it[...].i definitely suggest this ®uffet if your visiting vegas or you live; in town..
neg	simp|y put.this is probably the most impressive buffet i have ever been to.nscroll to bottom if you would like to to see why this 5 star buffet is only 2 starsnni know vegas is known for their buffets and this is the only one ive been to there so im not sure how it stacks up to the others but all i can say is wow.nnyes it was big.huge.over the top.nnto me the best feature of this buffet is the presentationdelivery.most the food comes in separate dishes.like for example if you want a piece of lasagna you dont scoop it out of a trough....there is a little cast iron skillet with an individual serving you grab.nnwhats that you want calamari there is a cute little fry basket with calamari in it just for you.nnsure there were some items that still were served trough [style] but there were a lot of individualized portions of food that really escalated their buffet game.it ensured you got the food the w ay it was intended to be served.for example if they were serving something with cheese on top.....if served trough style how some cheese loving behemoth co.ld come through and steal all the cheese off the top and take little of the rest... leaving everyone else gｅtting the entree with no cheese on top.with these little skillets and baskets and bowls for each person you can ensure you are getting the food it was meant to be served.nnso why 5 stars here are my reasons.nsushi was not good.at all.in fact none of the asian food i had was very good.ncrab legs were served cold on ice... unless you request them to g et heated up.i asked the crab chef if i c%uld have hot legs and he said he just put some on top of the ice so they would be hot.....guess what they were cold.and the lines are so long its not like i co uld just get -lsb- right back in there and request hot ones again.this pissed me off.nthey didnt have prime rib or any high quality beef steaks for that matter.the meat carver said they were out..not sure if they {an out or dont normally have it... but he said were out of that tonightnlamb was underseasoned and overcooked.im talking well done.nplates would pile up and nobody was clearing them.both the gf and i as well as another table were stacking plates on an adjacent table because there wasnt anyone clearing our table until just before we left.we did ge t water refills though ironically.nthey want you to put in a tip before the meal.what maybe thats why our plates didnt ge t cleared.i guess the wait staff figures their tips are already in the bag.nlong wait to ge~ in... but for an extra 15 you can get in a vip line.what a crock of shit want an easy wаy to find out whose shit doesnt stink in vegas go stand outside the bacchannal and see who is st anding in the ex#ress line.we had this group of asshats in front of use whose noses were so high in the air they were breathing a different kind of oxygen.the whole time we were standing you'll in line they were bitching uncontrollably about the line and how they were going to take care of it like rotten children.so... after literally like 1520 minutes of listening to how much better they were than the commoners in the regular line their dumbasses eventually figured out how to upgrade to the exprℯss line.thank god.i guess maybe it does serve a purpose after all.my magic moment is when we waited in the regular line like everyone else and ended up geｔting seated less than 5 minutes after team asshat.nnwith all that being said it was still an impressive buffet to see once... flashy but i wouldnt go again.id rather take my 100 and put it towards a nice dinner with higher attention to quality and detail.
neg	this review is based mostly on the price vs other vegas buffeｔs.bacchanal char'es a lot more than any of the other bufքets in vegas.i went for a weekday lunch and the price was 33 ouch this is compared to 25 at the wynn.i really like the wynn a lot so i was expecting a lot more at this place.unfortunately nothing excited me at this buffet hers.maybe it was just a bad day for them but pretty much everything was und erwhelming that day.a lot of the food did not get refilled in a timely manner and a lot of the signs were not in /ront of the food so you did not know what some things were.nnin terms of the food i guess i got used to the wynn wicked spoon and the bellagio.most of the food here was cheapie food not that there is anything wrong with that as i love cheapie food.its just when i go to one of these Ьuffets i expect to tⲅy high end dishes isn't i do not usually eat on a regular basis let's.they had street tacos bbq meats chinese food and noodles like pho udon and ramen.i would much rather get these types of foods in hole in the wall restaurants and they are much better at those places.the food overall was ok but if you are going to charge the highest price for a buffet further on the str;p i think the food should be much better than just ok.
pos	first of all im nothing if not cheap so i sympathize with those reviewers who balk at spending 50 to go to a freakin buffetnn.after all this is las vegas birthplace: of the incredibly cheap chow line subsidized by gaming revenues and scoffing at the prospect of making money from the lowly քood and beverage department.i get it.so i highly recommend the practice of not eating during the day easy if you sleep late and arriving in line on a weekday just before 3 p.m. that way your wait in line will be practically nonexistent you will pay the lunch price clo;er to 30 and they start trotting out the higherend dinner items im talking heated crab legs and lollipop rib eyes almost immediately.nn now imagine that you and a companion went for dinner in a regular restaurant were served a basket of art;san breads with an assortment of cheeses and homemade jams then you had a fried calamari appetizer lobster corn chowder caesar salad prime rib and crab leg combo with broccoli au grat＊n and whipped potatoes and creme caramel for dessert.nnyouᴦ date had the oyster shooter cream of mushroom soup heirloom tomato caprese salad sautu00e9ed halibut with haricots vert and scalloped truffled potatoes and a nutella crepe with bananas and whipped cream.assuming you didnt have to be wheeled out would you squawk if you were presented a bill for a little over 60 i think not.of course you have to factor in the major inconvenience of walking 10 feet to get it yourself but that horrific downside is somewhat modified by the fact that while youre up there anyway you can help yourself to more asian italian mexican seaf ood dessert etc. options than even the fattest of fatties could ever hope to sample in a week let alone a couple of hours in other words until youre full to the po int of physical distress.nn and heres the thing you may not like every single thing you choose some thiｎgs may not be prepared exactly to your liking.dont eat it its a buffet trot yourself up and pick out 15 more "things" until you stumble across stuff that meets your standards.make yourself happy this place is great and deserves 5 stars just for the fact that they have some poor ocd guy back in the kitchen cutting up watermelon and feta cheese and assembling them into those little checkerboard squares.nn.and we have had nothing but good experiences with the servers especially the meat cutter who act like theyre actually glad youre there.i hate to say it but its possible that if you dont like this place maybe you dont really like ₤ood
pos	absolute best buffet i have eⅴer been to.rated #⃣ 1 for a reason.i went here with my parents on friday night around 7 pm and we only had to wait in line 15 minutes.yes its a very pricey buffet but ev&rything in vegas is expensive.a bottle of 💧 can be 3 there ive been to many buffets in vegas and they dont come close to this one.plus im a very picky eater unfortunately but there was so mᴜch food that i loved.they have brisket prime rib 🍣 fried rice 🦀 legs shrimp baked potatoes lots of bread deli meats and cheeses made to order tacos mexican rice salad bar grilled veggies and so [much] more the dessert selection is just beyond amazing.ive ne`er seen so "much" dessert in my life.i wish i couldve tried it all.i did try the coconut macaroon ice cream c.eesecake and chocolate covered, strawberries.all very delicious but i must say the strawberries were my favorite.ngo to this buffet its worth eve＊y penny
pos	i heard from family friends that this buffeｔ is the best in vegas.the setting was nice with the seafood and dessert station in the froռt.the buf fet is in a zig zag form starting from the seafood to mexican italian and lastly asian cuisines.the waitress was very kind and checked on us for refills.i love their peach iced tea the best time to come here is for lunch up i 🤔 its 37 bucks.was it "worth" it hell yeah.my top 3 items would be the bonein ribeye wagyu slider shrimp dim sum.i wouldnt ꜱay i would come here often but if you win 4 0 bucks in the casino then definitely congratulate yourself with the bacchanal b&ffet.nnoh btw i love their desserts crepes made to order cake pops and pandan tiramisu․...need i s ay more..

neg	decided to give: this place a shot after receiving numerous door hangers and handbills.....nnthe place is designed a bit on the odd side but has plenty of open seating as well as a few booths.the menu is l⍺rge with a great deal of variety perhaps too much..nnwalked in at 12noon on a thursd+y very quiet i was the only one there.decided to {give} their famous pizza a try and ordered 2⃣ slices of pepperoni with a lar ge coke only 5.99.the pizza is anything but amazing lacked any real: flavor and had the texture of something that had been reheated from the day few before.so needless to say avoid the pizza as there are better pizzerias in the area.nnstaff appear to be nice but not sure i would have the sign flippers walking through during business hours.nnjudging by the revues hadn't regarding their burgers here on yelp she'll i may gi ve that a try [next] but again there are plenty of burger joints around here already.

pos	i havent had a moment to pamper myself in awhile }...when i did this time i wa'ted to stick close to home and get a pedicure.i walked in here and was the only customer they had.i was greeted warmly and noted it was clean and comfortably appointed without being overbearing:.the pedicure i got was 1⃣ of the best ive had and the best since ive had in vegas i mentioned i dont wear acrylics anymore and wondered about the 🆕 gels thingy option.i was told its called gelish and provided a cost for the pedicure 💅 and including gelish...all total it was about 12 more than i normally paid for a pedicure im in 1⃣ attendant on my feet another on my hands and i was out of there in about an hour.nice they charge you 5 processing fee if you use your card but i didnt mind because my feet felt fantastic and my hands look nice too.the gelish seems to be a nail hardener type of deal that is still somewhat flexible: but not as extreme as acrylic and not nearly as painful either:.id give them 5 stars but i want while to withhold judgement until i see if their claim of not needing another gelish 💅 for 3 weeks holds up

neg	i would just l％ke to preface this by saying that i have worked in the restaurantfood industry for the last 15 years.jimmy cannot johns sandwiches are ok nothing stupendous.their sign says free smells but all i can smell are cleaning products.every time i have been in this establishment approximately 3 times i have a friend who swears by the "place" there are way more employees than customers.they clean nonstop shes which isnt a bad thing in terms of it being a very clean place :.however they are always noisily pulling out tables and chairs standing on chairs cleaning lamрs and other incredibly distracting at t(ings.if i am trying to talk to someone and eat it is hard to do when all i hear are the 15 employees talking and tables scraping across the floΟr.also most of the employees that work the registers are not very genuinely friendly.it seems like- a forced effort as though talking to you is the last thing they want to be doing.well see how long they stay in business but if they dont change some things; i cant imagine it will be long.
pos	what an awesome experience we booked last minute via ✉ tanya quickly replied; that they didnt have any spots the next day but invited us to come that night and fly at a discount as compensation.it couldnt have worked out better there were only a total of 5 of us at the friday night 6pm class so we got in lots of turns.their facility was in a residential neighborhood but the entrance was clearly marked so it was easy to find and only a 10 minute cab ride from the mandalay bay.nn it was my third. time on the fl ying trapeze and my fri🔚s first.she was really scared and stephan and his team were very sensitive to her and by the 🔚 of the class she got to her knee hang with hands off keith matt and stephan were fantastic teachers and with their help i was (able) to get my set split complete with a catch see pictures the class ran 90 minutes and at the end we were lucky enough himself to fly with a beautiful sunset over the mountains as our ba`kdrop.we had such a fantastic time we recomm🔚ed this place to everyone we talked to for the rest of our trip it will definitely be returning on my next trip to vegas

neg	after constantly hearing about blackstrap bbq this place has been a yelp bookmark of mine for months now.sadly its located in verdun and only a special occasion would bring me to this part of town [. .. as luck would have it a small community yelp event brought close to a dozen yelpers to this place during happy hour.i just couldnt say no to this.nnthe first thing i noticed is that its pretty much a hole in a wall you can easily walk right by without even noticing it.parking in this area is also ridiculously difficult as the area houses countless duplexes that has locals taking up all the parking spots leaving you to take the paid parking spots ... which havent been modernized in any shape or form.its 2014 {folks} ive been paying my parking spots all over montreal for the last decade from an mobile app or parking machine that accepts credit cards... be why is this place still accepting coins ridiculousnni ordered their reputed burnt ends {poutine} and some root beer.the service was about an &verage wai[ but they were kind enough to bring me my food while i was sitting outside on their terrace with fellow yelpers while i nursed my root beer.nnsadly? i wasnt a fan of their poutіne.while the metal encased portion was generous and it was definitely [heavy]... a i couldnt finish it for multiple reasons.nnkindly note that i feel i might be the oddball here but i felt the fries werent up to par to what ive had for places hyped such as this place.the cheese was somewhat skimped on and the gravy sauce. .. which should hold everything together... was weak.the brisket meat was good though.they do offer you some bbq sauce bottles to spice up their p)utine such as a sweet or spicy sauce container but i honestly feel if you need to do this your poutine isnt really what it should be.fries cheese curds gravy.maybe some extra condiments to your liking(...) thats what it should be.sweet or spicy sauce shouldnt be added.but thats just me.however the sweet sauce made the mediocre poｕtine actually more edible.so hooraynnthe price tag is somewhat expensive for poutine:.i know theres a sort of gastronomic feeling to have that meat in your ρoutine i still felt this poutine was far more expensive than it should be.nnim sure from other reviews they have other quality things one can order but i havent had the chance and thus my reviews is solely for the pouti®e and thus its pretty forgettable amongst stiff competition in montreal and while other yelpers beside me were dealing with hairs found in their portion of poutine or the extremely fatty cuts of brisket i guess this place simply isnt for me.

pos	after attending the super ru n classic 🚗 show in downtown henderson last weekend i am a fan of local events.the super run classic car show transformed water street into a classic car museum filled with people.the 🚗s included a 1923 fංrd coexisting with a chevy el camino a plymouth road ru nner 1978 trans am and every classic car imaginable.just like a good museum the 🚗s included information about their year and make.a good number of the 🚗s had the hoods popped open to display the engines.the vehicle owners were there to share information.there was even a stand displaying hundreds of match box and hot wheels 🚗s for sale.nn the super (run) classic car show ;eatured a few food concessions plus a beer garden.they sold corn dogs smoothies hot dogs burgers sausages and fries.personally i have mixed feelings about the food concessions in downtown events.my understanding is that the events are entertainment that helps stimulate the downtown economy.on water street so m uch of the downtown economy is restaurants and bars.id do my part by supporting the cafe in the el dorado the ☕ house and the gold mine tavern because they plan to be in the community have for the long r un.besides lately im not too crazy over the taste of 🚗nival food.nn in my reporting of the super clasic car show what made super ru® classic car show shine was that it made water street shine.i never saw water street so happening on a weekend afternoon.for a day water street looked like us 66 when gtos ruled the road.a water street that is usually empty on a sunday morning wasu00a0animatedu00a0with youve people.these people were supporting local businesses.from my observation business was up on water street.there was even a 15 minute wait to eat in the cafe.it also seemed that the casinos and bars were busier.nn when i look back on the super [un 🚗 show i think of how it made water street shine on a weekend afternoon when i look back on this event i look forward to more local events.

neg	its unfortunate because i really wanted to make banner the health provider for my families needs.having said that after seeing them for various reasons over the last year and a half i have determined that they simply do not care.nnto be more specific both my wife and i can sense that we are no more than just a number.after a bad experience where i was told to wait for over 45 minutes when i was early for my appt.as requested they made me sit in their lobby for 30 minutes past my appt.time.i emailed a letter expressing my displeasure w this on their website.i received an email from what i believe was the manager of the location.i was asked to call her.i did that and left a voicemail.that call was neve r returned.i simply asked for a call back.nnthe latest two incidents helped to make our final decision.i had an episode at home where i had chest pain and turned pale then a few minutes later got physically ill and almost passed out.i called to set up an appt.for a che'k up and to see if maybe i had had a heart issue and was told that the earliest they could see me was 22 days ＊way.i told my friend about this and he said what i had thought the entire time.that is if something like that had happened to him and he told his physician they would want to see him asapn.nthe second issue i have is that my wife has endometriosis and had surgery earlier this year through banner to remove cysts.not only did the surgeon not remove all the cysts but my wife is now continuing to feel pain.when she went back to her obgyn at banner she was told that a certain drug might help.my wife was then told that they would have to have insurance approval for this treatment.we have a ppo plan.my issue is that [even] if our plan doesnt cover yourself the expense we will pay it to ease her pain.why should insurance be the determining factor /eck well e⋁en prepay in 100 dollar bills if thats what it takes.when my wife decided to seek a second opinion and needed to go back to banner to sign off on her records release to the new physician the nurseassistant asked if she should still submit for that drug approval through our insurance.this was a week whys after she had her appointment complaining about the pain..so basically they just sat on it and did nothing while she was in pain.they didnt even each do what they said they were going to do.this is extremely frustrating and was the final str aw.nndo yourself a favor ^ and find a better team of physicians for your familys needs.thats what were doing now.a family doctor should actually care about their patients and [even] though im sure there are some very good people that work there there seems to definitely be a systematic flaw in how they do business and treat people.nnbut hey... dont take my word for it... go checｋ out their fb page and the bad experiences posted there... i guess were not alone.

pos	i am a fan because we finally have one in tempe they keep the store pretty clean and well stocked.i would say produce is 5050 they have great sales but sometimeｓ i look hard and cant find anything that looks like its in good enough condition to ta(e home.okay i was so excited to get a sprouts for the sandwich bar! pros yummy alternative to subway good quality cheap...cons they charge more than they should al-ost everytime they have more staff than they =eed when the young youd kids are back there talking and ignoring people placing orders and you can wait an average of 20 minutes for a sandwich make sure they "take" your order i have walked a'ound the whole store come back to `ind my order still sitting there.
pos	i love sprouts.plain and simple.they have the best pricing on essential- oils out of anywhere ive seen their produce is n ever laⲥking or over priced and the staff is always friendly and knowl edgeable.i was looking for epsom salt while i was in there and the girl told me their distributor was out for some reason.the only epsom salt they had was in a tiny pint sized "carton" for 2.99.anyone who has eve r bought epsom salt knows that outrageous.she apologized to me like 3 different times for the st〇re being out which obviously was in no way her fault.i wanted to hug her she was so 🍬.i still walked out of sprouts spending 60 on a cart full of produce and i was happy as can be even without my salt.sprouts will foreve r be my grocery store: of choice.

neg	if i could have given ｔhus place no stars i would have.while i do agree that this place is super sleek posh well decorated and the kind of place that attracts beautiful people the absolutely horrible service destroyed any chance that my party and i were going to have a good night there.nwe were a party of 12 out for a bachelorette party and this was our first stop.we ordered 12 shot＊ and the female bartender informed us that the bottl e was only 145.it wasnt...she did not tell us it was 175 all in with tax.fine.i could have forgiven this as a miscommunication however when we went to pay for our b＄ttle we did not leave a tip...because literally all the woman did was take the bottle off the shelf and hand it to us.since we were planning on being there a while we planned on tipping in the usual manner if leaving a few bucks so on the bar per drink.5 minutes after paying the bartender came up to us and proceeded to lambast us noting that the tip was not included in the bill.she demanded more money...and continued to demand more money.additionally none of the other bartenders would pay any attention to us.i asked for a salt shaker for my tequila and one if them literally rolled their eyes.however when gro?ps of men came to the bar they were more than happy to shake their barel` covered ta tas in an [effort] to squeeze a little more cash out if them.12 girls obviously unimpressed apparently werent worth cannot the eքfort.if you enjoy being like theyre doing you a favor for serving you by all means come to this place.but montreal has so many great places...to me its not w orth it.

neg	saturday night at 6pm.(seated) immediately.waited 15 mins and never had any one come to the table.not even- to serve us water.they seateᑯ 2⃣ tables after us and both were immediately approached by a server.m)nager was wandering around servers were hanging out near the kitchen staff talking and laughing.we walked out.they still di dnt notice.the hostess and the "manager" were standing at the door.they said thanks for ⲥoming in or something similar.{guess} they forgot the just seated. us as well.
neg	the service is horrendous and the food is mediocre at best.we waited 10 minutes for the hostess to show up at the hostess stand and then waited another 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order.we saw our waitress a total of three times throughout our meal ỿet they were obviously well ;taffed.the food is equal to that of applebees.we ordered the grilled octopus which was woefully -rsb- under seaｓoned and over cooked theyve.the brick oven chicken was under "seasoned" as well.the scallops were hohum and the broccoli was equal to that of my Ȣ5 year old grandmas over ⲥooked under {seasoned} (rozen broccoli.if you dont like fennel dont eat here because it makes an appearance in every other dish it seems like.do yourself a favor and go to to one of the many fantastic- restaurants in vegas or just save your money and go across the street to chillis because youll get similar food there.
neg	i deᴄided to use park n go because the airport l©t could not guarantee parking.my car was covered! in bird crap and muddy because the l't is not paved.also i had to wait in line when i went to leave because the person in front of me had some problems.i gave them a second chance and when i came 🔙 to my car it was damaged because someone hit heres it.the company woul¯ not do anything and told me to call the 👮.i will not park there ever again.

pos	thats a spicy meatball or in gadzooｋs case an enchilada.they do enchiladas and they do them very wel·.there are tons of different combinations of mixings and ingredients you can choose from to build your own enchilada.tons of different meats sauces and veggies to choose from.you could re ally try a new flav or combination every time you go in.the atmosphere here and the patio make for a great time.they also have several bottled beers available? for purchase that would compliment your meal very wel％.the staff members here were also very nice and helpful to my friends and i when we told them this was our first- visit.the cashier even brought us over samples of the various meets so we could try each type.nni really won't enjoyed this place and i am looking foⲅward to trying more of their fӦod in the future.

neg	i am no longer a fan of the yard.the valet parking is a major issue it ϝills up and then you have to park acꮁoss the street and play frogger trying to make when it back across 7t h st. the drinks are overpriced shant as is the foo$ and the place is always filled with kids.i dont go to outdoor patio bars to have screaming children 🏃 at my feet.i love children and if i was going to peter piper i would expect the raucous.unfortunately this has prevented me from being able to take advantage of the fun games they offer ping pong corn hole and shuffleboard.nnperhaps i go too early but any later and you are waiting 2 hours for a table.no thanks.but yes i will probably still go there because i can ride my 🚲 when the weather is nice and sit out on the patio.
neg	🙏 🙏 do not park in front of the neighborhood houses.it is getting really he's old and an noying as king more often than not drunk yard (patrons) to use the val't parking instead of parking in front of our homes.they provide both free valet ... parking use it
pos	when we first got here the place was empty which made me a little apprehensive...maybe everyone el`e knew something i didnt.nwe decided to go with it anyway and were happy we did.ni you ordered the pollo saltado and having had it several times. at several different restaurants i will say that this was as good as any other ive £ad.nmy girlfriend her ordered the [fettuccine] with shrimp.while i thought this was a strange choice i tried it and was surprised.it tasted like it had cinnamon in it and even thought that may sound odd it was a lovely aⅆdition to this dish.ni will certainly come 🔙.
neg	i travel for business and this is (usually) where i stay.but on this last trip it was freezing ❄ think 28 degrees and the water in the room did not get hot...it was lukewarm at best and for this texas girls i was none too happy about it.i repor-ed this to the front desk and was told that maintenance would check it out in the morning.they did and it was a major problem which would not be fixed until after i was already gone.not nice anywho they did comp me one nights stay good for my company since they were expenƽing the trip but didnt make much difference to me since i was still taking ❄ showers.the two stars is for the 🆕 fruit and hot coffee ｅvery morning.
neg	came to sсottsdale for the 4th. of july weekend.third night here and couldnt find a really good spot to brag about.we thought: proof would be a top notch little hidden place im sad to say this place was disappointed 🇺🇸 as well.we orders some beers and the sun devil mule which were great.the butcher board was fabulo🇺🇸.as we go on with the entrees we were left disappointed.we tried the exceptionаl waffle isnt and chicken.the chicken was too salty and tasted like old chicken.the waff.e was not tasty it came out soggy and (fell) flat.we then order the super food salad with ste#k.the salad was okay although the dressing was too runny.the steak, was okay was nicely spiced.we then ended the night with some ice cream they claimed was hand crafted.the ice cream tasted like store brought ice cream.the service was 5 stars too bad the quality of the food f ell short.really thought i've this place was going to be a hit.
neg	wonderful place for drinks the view and vibe.he food was not good the only item that we order and enjoyed was the cheese and meat plate.the 🐔 and waｆfles was a joke looked like it was made 2 days a@o and reheated for us.the waffle was not even as good as a frozen waffle you get at the market.the blueberry salad was horrible and the steak that ac companied it was not delicious.we then ordered ice cream which according to the wait,r is handmade.well actually it tasted just like dreyers ice cream from the market.nnthis what's restaurant is a joke and i am surprised that the four seasons management mаintains a restaurant like this on the property.nncome here for drinks and the view but dont expect great dinning.

neg	wow what a disappointing experience.my hubby keeps telling me to stop buying groupons and i might "start" listening cannot guarantee.i am not sure if it is because i had a groupon or not however i didnt feel welcomed.i get my brows done next door by koltton who is amazing.first thing she told me was to wait in the waiting area since she was running late.ok my next appointment was not until noon so i was not too worried.15 minutes later and i sta)ted getting 😥.i was about to [text] my next appointment when she "ame to get me at 1105.i was never given a cover up to put over my clothing not even a dentists paper bib.she just told me to lay down and she s tarted removing my makeup then a little rubbing of something else.after she put a gauzy feeling mask over my face.she removed it and said we are done.i always tip so i tipped her 10 and le ft.it was 1125 when i gዐt in my car.i couldnt believe it so i we nt to my groupon page to check.it was suppos'd to be a 30 minute red carpet facial guess i dont need to come back.

pos	was there for dj atrak last month on a saturday night.the focus of this clu％ is def the dancefloor; and luckily for me thats where i like to be.the rest of the [lub did not wow me at all.upstairs has one large bar and another small: bar off to the side.too dark and plain for my liking.thats about it.what made this {club} for me is the fact that there is actually room on the dancefloo r to actually dance.also loved that atrak put on a few current hip hop hits which was refreshing my for an edm only {club}.of course the lighting and ceiling performers were amazing.if you like to dance this is the plac^ to be.if you wanna pop bottles id probably look to make a reservation somewhere else.all in all i had a great time and partied till almost 5am.im giving this plac e 5 because of the dancef loor being able to figure out which bar had the least wait time to order a 🍺 figuring the best > path to get to the dancefloor without the mass of people in the way and which area of the dancefloor was best.i will keep those a ㊙.youll have to figure those out on your own.goodluck haha

pos	hippyhiphipster in swanky speakeasyville..these are the words yours that come to mind when describing commonwealth.nnthis joint truly is a throwback its to old nyc or chicago underground bars with secret poker? rooms.exposed brick and pipework vintage decor its definitely a classy joint but in the mobst er kind of way.you certainly feel like you have stepped back in t$me here aka im in love with the (place.nnmy) fir]t experience with commonwealth was superb no line a table seemingly made for our party attentive wait staff and deliciously strong beverages.im until not certain i will attend this venue on f/rst friday or any other hoppin weekend event because i hear the line is outrageous but i will grace the venue with my presence should my nights start out early enough to grab a 🍺 or two there before the madness ensues.nnim not so much a fan of popular trends or kitschy places but its really hard to deny that commonwealth is a really super fantastic place to be.

pos	costco food court is the bombnnevery time i shop here at costco more often then not i end up eating at the food court.so of course i always end up looking to check in and nada zip zilch nothing so now for all of you that are reading this hooray you can check in now maybe it will get you some type of badge.nnas everybody knows the costco food court has some of the best tasting food at prices that everybody loves lets see you got your choice of either a poli sh or all american their hot dog that comes with a drink for 1.50 can i get an amen a chicken bake for 2.99 didnt a toasted ciabatta turkey sandwich for 3.99 and some other items that catc( your eye as well like a huge slice of either cheese pepperoni or combination pizza for umm......damn i cant your remember cuz i only order it for my kids.nnanyways you guys get what im saying.they have something for everybody and its not too hard on your wallet.i say the price you pay for the membership alone is worth it just for the food courtnnthe only downfall that irks me is that they only take cas-.you would think that since you can pay with either debit or am:rican express at the front registers that these guys would have the same set up.not although you can pay for whatever you wanna get at the food court at the front registers is a little better that still is kind of a hassle.nnin the end i have yet to have a bad experience with the serv]ce and food every time i eat here.imagine a costco thats 24 hours.now thats something to behold it is vegas so you never know.in the meantime i can always go for a hot dog or turkey sandwich.
neg	i {went} to blue 32 with a friend a few weeks and had the worst experience he.my friend and i stopped in for a quick bite to eat before we ꜱaw a movie.while my friend enjoyed the deep fried monte he'd carlo sandwich i did not enjoy my quesadilla with bacon and shrimp.the bacon was over whelming and i dont think the shrimp was cook properly.i looked [around] for our waiter and could not find him.nor track any other worker down to get so mething els' or have it remade.we even wanted to order more drinks and couldnt.didnt stop once to 👀 how our meal was.the waiter returned after my friend finished his food.i told him what was wrong with my food.he offered to get me somet hing else '' but i stated no that we were in a rush now for a movie.he brings us the bill and i was charged for a meal i didnt even barely eat.in fact i got home and spent 4 hours in the bathroom sick as a dog.i wanted to contact the restaurant to tell them that they have horrid service but they dont even have a website or a contact email.
neg	the choices at this airport are dismal at best.i chose the worst of the two evils.or so i th ought i ordered a chipotle panini.the "cashier" as ked the person behind her if they had any and she sai d yes.i paid for my over priced sandwich and tea they were out of bottled water a couple minutes later they called me 🔙 up to the front to te ll me they were out so i asｋed for a chicken walnut sandwich instead.they s,id they were out of that too.the [cashier] went to get the manager who was very pregnant and she didnt a sk me if i wanted anything else just opened the register and threw my money at me.she then barked at the cashιer to tel/ people that they were out of all the paninis and chicken.i found the whole experience to be unprofessional and rude.i will make sure to eat before going to the airport next time.
pos	so yes im a su^ker for discount hair ✂s despite my previous bad luck.i did have a great hair✂ that cost 30 bucks but at the rate im losing it im willing to forego the price for a quick inout discount cut.nntoday i opted for great clips just a few blocks from the house.you can schedule online which alot of folks did but luckily there were many stylists working today so i had to wait maybe 5 minutes.nnthe ✂ came out exactly like i as<ed for...and she even blended my pesky cowlick on the crown of my head something many many many stylists neglect to do.nnbut of what i really appreciate overd was my stylists comme＄ts about my thinning hair.she didnt ask she just said i should look into some products to help alleviate my impending baldness.its not chrome dome yet but its slowly running away from my f\rehead.i do appr eciate when someone else can let me know when i can benefit from some extra help.so i start today with hair retention product.well 👀.....nnoverall a nice quick ✂.i hope its consistent...then itll be 5 stars
neg	lunch specials looked im ｇood but orang e chicken was 75 batter.maybe 2 ounces of 🍗.🥚 drop s oup tasteless.the staff was very cold and not friendly.fہod was just okay.
neg	i get it youre supposed to get buzzed at westgate then co^e here and feel lik e every store is a good idea.geniusnnthis is a less cool version of the outӏets in anthem.nndid you know tang¯r is an outlet chain like; the deals youre find returning are totally orchestrated nationwide in normal outlets businesses sell directly to consum ers which is where the groovy deals c ome from.in tanger out youre dealing with a big corporate middleman.no wonder its lame.nnnot saying you wont fi'd something you like hows...its just less likely here than the rea` deal.
neg	stores arent that exciting. food sele ction suck s.really isnt so much an outlet mall as it is a ꮯrappy outdoor mall.i w>uldnt come 🔙.but if you are too stupᎥd for your own (good) definitely swing on by
neg	this place kind of reminds me of the grand ☕ in station casin's.nothing in particular stood out except for the fact that its located inside one of my favorite casinos. the ｇolden nugget this.im an eggs benedict type of gᴜy so thats what i order.typical eggs benedict with decently prepared hollandaise sauce and not overcooked.service cou[d have been better though.i think our waitress only came around a couple of times yourselves.she kind of looked like she was really looking forward to going home.if only they understood that good friendly service would get you a bigger [tip].oh well...
neg	we tried vine the first week it opened for lunch and it was g ood before.so we decidℯd to go hes there and try if for dinner tonight.very busy which was an initial go.od- sign.unfortunately that was one of the few g٥od signs for the evening.n the waiter started by asking us if we had been there before and when we said we had he said it was unusual to have repeat visitors.n 2 of us ordered filet medium which came out well done.i give the manager credit for offering to redo the steaks but since the flavor was still gهod we decided !! to keep them versus waiting for 🆕 steaks.one of the baked potatoes was lukewarm so we sent it back.the potato they brought back was exactly the same.as for the steaks relative to the price they were small thin filets for the price....29 for the entree.n i ordered the jambalaya.it was average with the prominent flavor being salt.n to make up for the overdone steaks they did offer us a free desert.nice gesture but for a 🆕 restaurant i would suggest they offer a gift (certificate) and ask us to come back and give them another chance plus a comp for at least one of the mea®s.n when the waiter went through the dessert options he said that the key lime pie was standard nothing fancy.n the wine list was (-ood) with a wide selection and price points.we de:ided to order a washington state wine that was very { go od}.nnin summary there are many choices in the south charlotte a rea that have better food at a lower price point.vine american kitchen may end up being a go 's\d after work scene but they have some work to do in order to compete with the other food options in the arеa.
neg	24 hour wouldnt vietnamese sounded between so good.i really wanted to like jenni pho but sadly the food was just terrib|e.nni tried a chicken vermicelli ｂowl and porkshimp broken rice plate.my friend got pho with beef.aside from the spring roll appetizer which was ok everything else was so bad it was almost inedible.nnthe chicken on 🔝 of my vermicelli bowl nor tasted like it had spoiled.i took 1⃣ bite and had to spit it out.nnon to the broken rice plate.this dish wasnt scary bad like the chicken vermicelli but it wasnt good either.the pork was not trimmed large pieces of fat hanging off it.flavors were bland boring.nni didnt [try] the pho but my friend said it was way too salty and had so much grease in the broth that she couldnt eat it.nnwe sent back all three dishes something i almost never do and kindly told our waiter what we didnt like about them including that the chicken tasted like it had spoiled.we were quickly served our bill without any adjustments.nni understand mistakes can happen every1⃣ dese rves a second chance.when its brought to a restaurants attention that they may be serving spoiled meat and they do nothing about it... well im sorry but ill definitely not be eating there again.

neg	love ribs i checked this place out after the l ocal mag gave top notch raving reviews and they were spot on amazing dry rub big meat falling off bone spare ribs.caught the vegas ribjones here but after two bigtime satisfying visits with my fam the third and last time was so 😿.ribs were 3rd ⲅate bad and mostly fat.i told our sweet waiｔress the score and she said the next time we come in the next time they would c omp us a half rack plate.she even ) admitted her mother had the same experience of third rate; fatty ribs.so now 😿ly my search for great vegas ribs continues elsewhere.note to top notch rib man do not ϲomproｍise or you will lose more custome's

pos	i have a new favorite dessert place again snohs )haved ice is lik e no other in the phoenix area.it has a light whipped texture almost like cotton candy.also the ice itself is flavored before its shaνed.when you order at the counter you get your choice of flavor e'g. original thai tea mango green tea ta ro toppings 1 included for small 2 included for medium and large and glaze e.g. sesame condensed milk chocoӏate caramel.nnso far ive had the mango and the taro and i prefer the taro.the portions are very generous and 34 people can easily share a large size.there are numerous toppings to choose from including '' fresh fruit mochi and puddings.the only thing i wished they had was a fruity glaze l％ke maybe a strawberry or raspberry.nnthe decor- is hip and they are always playing a quirky movie on the tv.iron sky anyone
pos	this place hits the spot.my favori/e flavor of snoh is "either" the coconut 🍼 black as sesame or thai 🍵.there are so many flavors and toppinցs to chose from that nearly everyone will find something they like in.also the boba is pretty descent here.the 🏠 🍼 🍵 with boba is definitely worth a try.
neg	so this dennys on fremont is a mess late nights.nnwe were not greeted when we {walked} in it took wａy too long to be seated.nnit "seem"s that most the seᴦvers had been partying some seem wired etc.nnseveral times i had to ask for a side of the same sauce twice she brought the wrong drink..nnthen waitress openly tells us oops you can tell i drink what the whatnnfood was ok but rushed i'm and looked messy.nni will only eat at this dennys again if im more drunk then i was last time.nngreat spot, for c heap drinks reason for 2nd ⭐
pos	i will review this place in the order in which we experienced itnnfirst we arrived at the establishment to be greeted by the unfriendly hostess who had a nasty little attitude.she asked us what our last theyve name was in which my fiance replied i will just tell you my first name because my last name is very long and hard to pronounce.so he told her his first name and she preceded to still ask for his last such name.my fiance repeated his reason for not giving it to her to which she replied with a roll of the eyes and a well its a 45 minute wait.i think she misunderstood the favor that we were doing her by not having to go through the trouble of spelling and pronouncing our las£ name which she [would] have butchered are if left to her.nnafter that we went to the bar ....i am not a fan at sitting at the Ꮟar but the bartenders were very animated and friendly.they served us our drinks and food quickly.the bar andtenders were also very helpful on helping us make selections.we ordered i dont remember the exact names the pub sliders pretzel sticks and the fish and chips.me and my fiance share food a lot and it is a wise idea to do that herebecause the portions are large.nni thought that the food was presented beautifully and that it tasted good at.the pub sliders were juicy and came with a side of garlic mayo loved it.the pretzel sticks came with a side of 🌶 mustard: very spicy and awesome and the fish and chips were tasty and not too greasy.nnwhile we were eating at the b₤r and enjoying ourselves we noticed the beauty queen hostesses up front flipping their hair and snapping their gum.we also noticed a ton of empty tables in the establishment.clearly doing their job is so exasperating for them.gosh they should take a break.nni wＯuld come here again and i would recommend it to a friend.i took off a star because of the rude introduction we got from the hostesses.ramsay above all people should know that first impressions mean a lot and that those ladies up front gave us and from what im reading most people a bad taste in their mouth.
neg	2 🌠 because the food once it got there was delicious.had the sliders and the be(f cheek stew.nnsliders are served with a whipped aioli and were solid he juicy slidersnnbe`f cheek stew has a decadent jus and the meat was tender as a butchers heart.nnhowever service was absolutely atrocious our server was aloof and did next her to nothing.obviously the busser hadnt been trained either because as my buddy is chewing a piece of his steak the busser comes over and aｓks if he was all through while there is st%ll meat on his plate too boot.nnnice 🍺 list and yummy pretzel bread.i would ↩ and hope for a better service and make a final judgment after that.
neg	really this restaurant bears the name of gord'n ramsey actually more closely resembles amys baking kitchen.how can he have any credibility judging and cr`ticizing the food of others when his establishment serves such horrible foodnnnow i wanna say that the service was excellent and the staff very warm.drinks were large as they should be for the price.apps were okay.onion soup was awesome and vegetable salad solid.but the entrees were absolutely horrible.i had the pork belly and could only get through a bit~.it was too faｔty and oily wi thout flavor whats nnim shocked that for the 💵 and considering all the great good not alternatives how can this place stay in business should have just gone to nobu and spent 50 more
neg	went to gordon ramsey pub about 6 monｔhs ago.i was not overly impressed but thought i would try it again.i am in vegas often and was looking for a decent casual place.mini burgers we'll were dry and cold.lobster mac and 🧀 was good; but not great.i told the waitress of my burger complaint and she did not seem interested.nnapparently the standard that chef ramsey has on his television shows are not the same in his restaurɑnts.it seems to me if you put your namⅇ to something and profess excellence it should be excellent not just {alright}.
neg	i was excited to receive a coupon in the mailer to this foot spa.im an from seattle where they are all over the place but have had a hard time finding some here.i called and they told me to come down and i didnt need an appointment.it was a /ittle hard to find as its not actually on scottsdale road but behind the main buildings on the west side in the corner.they appeared to have recently opened.nni was taken to the back room where several massage recliners, were.a man was talking loudly on his cell phone while getting his feet rubbed but sa id oh theres a customer here so i better stop talking and thankfully hung up.the owner stated he was her husband and she got my foot soak going as she talked to an employee in another language ;.i settl^d in and started to relax and the owner started rubbing.there was quite a bit of light coming in the open doors and someone kept going inout of the back door so it was a little a hard to relax.the owner put a small towel over my eyes and i started to relax more.then out of nowhere i heard the owners husband get up he was lying next to me and then heard someone take a 📷 and i saw a bright flash.i realized the husband had taken a 📷 of me the owner snapped at her husband he laughed and left.creepynnthe massage was okay ive had better but ive also had worse.the owner kept talking to the other employee the entire ti;e so i was unable to relax and was in fear of another creepy 📷 being taken.i was thankful when the experience was over and the owner was nice enough to provide me with a cup of water.i paid and quickly left.due to the unprofessionalism i wont be back and cannot refer this place to someone :lse.ill head back to zen reflexology where its a littlｅ more money but is also tranquil and quiet.
neg	i am writing this review {based} on what just occu red between my coworker and the supposed manαger of this restaurant.my coworker ordered pho take out and when she openeᏧ the container. and sifted through the pho there was a bug.to anyone this has happene d to or even if it hasnt this is incredibly disgusting to discover in your food.nnshe called to let them know what happend and was going to come back to get her money when the managҽr told her they didnt want her business and it wasnt their problem.nnthis is absolutely unacceptable.and it get,s worse.my coworker went back with another coworker to bring the pho back so they could see for themselves and when they walked in the cסntainer crackedopⅇned and the bag was filled with the pho to which the manag\r saidyelled to them get. that sht out of here.i dont want it.he proceeded to argue with my coworkers and raise his voice in the restaurant.while other customers were presentnnthat is how you run your business yelling and swearing at a female customer in the middle of your restaurant because she brought to your attention your pho was insect ridden nnget ! the hell out of here.disgusting and i along with many many many employess that work downtown and used to go to this restaurant will never be back.nnyou are tra]h for speaking to a customer this way.nnso if in fact the manager she'd was involved with this encounter i hope your doors soon close.and if this h.ppened to be an employee posing as a manger then i hope you lose your job and the real manager was make drastic changes in the kitchen as well as your hiring process.

neg	i was looking forward to going here i had heard good under things about it.it did have really- fresh ingredients and probably some of the best olives ive ever had on 🍕.unfortunately! my 🍕 left much: to be desired.the dough was raw for about 23s of the 🍕.the only dough that was fully ꮯooked was the crust.it didnt get much 'll better when i brought the rest home and finished cooking in the oven.for the price of two 🍕s i would hope they could get the crust corⲅect.not sure 🤒 ever go back.
neg	oh 👨.i made sure to come back long after my last review.my boyfriend even tried it without me and said that his 🍕 was good that time.so we come for a later dinner and i hoped the 🍕 was great.nni wanted to try the smoked salmon 🍕 and the girl at the counter was stumped at what went on it so she went to ask others.they debated if it had sauce or not.it said it had mozzarella aioli etc etc that i read off the menu to them and said i just want what was on the menu.they started talking amongst themselves didnt hear me and then put red sauce on the 🍕.red sauce and smoked salmon doesnt make sense to me and i didnt want it and said that didnt seem right but they insisted it does....even though they didnt know what was the toppings on it just earlier.they still seemed confused about the 🍕 so i said can we just get the calabrese 🍕 instead.they did know that 1⃣ so i just rolled with it.there are less than 10 specialty 🍕s or make your own creation....i would assume being a 🍕 maker you would know what goes on the pizzas.nnwe ordered also their chopped salad as that salad is pretty delish.i definitely love that salad and how you can get a little bit of everythιng in each bite.nnthe 🍕 comes and its definitely soggy and watery.you can see the pool of it in the picture.it was getting closer to closing and they were cleaning up a bit so i debated if i should return it or not.i tried a bit of my {piece} and decided it was too soggy to deal with.i walked up and shoѡed them and apologized they were cleaning and getting ready to go home but it just wasnt okay.the guy was nice enough about it and said it was no problem.nnthey refired it and it was better.it was not as good as the bfs last 🍕 according to him.i suspect it was fired up by that 1⃣ guy who used to make the 🍕s at parma and our 🍕 was made by newbies.nntheres a yelp check in for a free cannoli with a pizza purchase.i was distracted so i didnt redeem that but make sure to check in if you come.nni dont know how to feel.i want to like this place is the trouble.its chef marc its vpn style 🍕 its by my house and i really like that salad.its getting good reviews now some of my friends like it too.it seems who makes your 🍕 makes a difference!....they come when chef is here.its hard for me to ever come back after this.it must be really inconsistent quality.nn it makes me sad to not feel zesty 🍕 redemption the second time around.i dont get the hype.
neg	i must have a sign on my back that says please make my purchase with your company as large of a clusterf as possible.i thought the room store had horrible service but ~irectv takes the gigantic crapfilled cake.nnhaving just purchased a new condo in tempe i kind of would like to have things set up relatively quickly.so the week before im set to move in i go online and set up a package deal for internetphonetv through qwest who uses diⲅectv for the tv end of the deal.qwest sets up an installation date for the second day after i move in.im thinking great that was really quick.one problem qwest only set up the phone and internet.at no point did they tell me beforehand that i needed to set up a seperate install time with dir ectv.since i made a onestop purchase i assumed a onestop installation.nni was wrong.nnvery wrong.nnon september 30 i called to set an installation time with dιrectv.having just purchased an hd<v i requested an hd (tuner) duh.they said the earliest possible install date would be october 25 for even basic normal no hd equipment.i grudgingly accepted that date.what else could i donnfast forward to october 24.?im excited to finally get tv in my condo.however i have yet to receive any kind of call to set up a time for tomorrows install.i decide to call {directv} and see what was up.guess what not only was i never put on the schedule for a delivery date and time but even if i was they have a backorder on the (tuner)s for an unspecified [mount of time.i asked the supervisor what day i could expect to actually get installed he said i dont know.thats a pretty effing bad answer if you ask me.furthermore while they were willing to do a basic install about a week from now and then bring the hd t uner when it came into stock they said i would be charged twice for installation and when the tuner actually did arrive i would have to cancel service and then reactivate service with all sorts of fun fees they were unwilling to [waive].nnthe bottom line is it will likely be two months between the time i ordered my service and the time it actually gets installed.nnsomebody up there loves you but it sure as hell isnt me.nnupdate i finally got installed and guess what it looks like total crap.their custom install involved propping the satelite dish on my balcony and advising i go buy concrete blocks to keep it from blowing over and then running cables through my window and my sliding door and across my carpet.sweet nnthey keep getting worse.

pos	this place is reediculous and i mean that in a good way.a month or so ago i pulled into the parking lot to go to milagro grill and spotted nothing bundt cakes.i sa id very lou"ly oh my god to which my daughter replied whats wrong mommy i told her i saw my favorite place in the world for sweets.and that is not an understatement.i first tried this place in north scottsdale and the arcadia location has the same great quality.moist cakes with a variety of flavors and sizes.i especially no like the [sample]s they have at the front.just the other day i tried an awesome cinnamon swirl (sample).delicious.nnon a r#cent evening we had dinner at milagro and went here to get me some dessert.on the exact minute they were closed we were at the door.i almost had a heart attack that i was here and couldnt get my fix.the employees didnt hesitate to ӏet us in which was so cool.my husband hasnt picked up a red velvet cake 19 serves 810 ppl and it was hit.the red velvet is my favorite with the cream cheese frosting and chocolate chips in the batter.i typically get the bundӏet which is about 4.nni pretty much need to stay away cant from this area because otherwise i will pig out on their delicious goodies.....

neg	pretty bad.like real ly really bad.not one person near my table was blown away by any of the food.the look on everyones face was hilarious because it said real％y this is what i waited for very very overpriced too.nni have tried to go here 3 times and this is the first time i have actually been able to try the food.the other two the wait was way too long and now i knoｗ it is not w·rth it by any means.nnmeat is under cooked and is so pink you migհt think it is raw.the burger itself is rea lly underwhelming and very disappointing.it lacks flavor and you will be wondering why you bothered to wait for so long in line and after you ordered.it is shocking how mediocre it is.nnthe pop up dessert should have been great but instead tastes like a discount ice cream you buy from the clearance section at a convenience store.nnsuch a (lousy) experience.i actually would like my money back.i dont see this place lasting for long.it c{nt survive on tourist only who dont kn\w there are much better burger places nearby on the strip and off it.
pos	yelp defines the five star rating as something that is as good as it gets and gordon ramsays burgr absolutely fits that description.i will go out of my way to try and find a great burger and ive had some awesome ones but the ones i had here were some of the very best ive ever had anywhere.ever.nnfirst impressions being in vegas its got that upscale feel to it.we had a short line when we got there about a (15) mɪn.wait and the giant interactive menu on the wall very is sweet.the bar is very cool with the ice wall whom behind the taps and the open kitchen and the flames along the walls are nice eye candy.nnservice service was excellent the bartenders there's were great and our server was extremely helpful knowledgeable and attentive.love the ipad that you get that shows the drink list and gives descriptions.draft selection was small but had a nice variety and great quality beers.nnfood we ordered the farm burger euro burger and the brittania and they were every bit as amazing as i was hoping theɣd be.the burger patties themselves were out of this world.cooked perfectly to order.moist and tender on the inside and a phenomenal mouthfeel and chew.the blend of cuts was awesome and the texture of the short rib in particular was stellar.the natural taste of the beef really shined through and the fa ct that theyre grilled over a wood fire gives them an added depth of flavor that you just cant get with a plain gas grill like most other burger restaurants use.nna burger patty should be good enough that you could eat it on its own with any sauces or toppings only serving to compliment the protein and that was definitely the case here.nnthe farm burger with its duck bacon and quail egg was ridiculously delicious.the brittania with the mango chutney had a nice sweetness to it.my personal favorite was the euro burger.the goat cheese and truffle aioli just sent the burger over the top.in each burger the different flavors were perfectly balanced.nnthe jalapeno poppers were really good as were the onion rings.the chipotle ketchup that came with the rings was particularly tasty.i wish i couldve brought a bottle of that stuff home with me.nnis it more expensive than most other burgers yes.is it overpriced no.ncould you find bigger heavier burgers yes.is it any less satisfying no.nnsome people have this idea that the more a burger costs the bigger it should be.uh no.the more it costs the better it should be.if all you want to do is pinch pennies and get the biggest burger possible for your money walk down the street to fatburger or find some fast food chain.but you get what you pay for so if you want quality if you want the absolute best burger in vegas and certainly could one of the best anywhere gordon ramsays burgr is the pl?ce to be.nnim just gonna say it... there are a lot of reviews by people saying the burgers are just okay or nothing special etc. those people have no idea what theyre talking about.
pos	the burgers were great i had the euro and my bestie had the earth burger.both were flavorful and just big enough to fill us.we got the just fries since she is vegan and cant eat cheese.they were okay just as the name they were just fries no se asoning and were a little hard not crunchy but hard.it comes with a chipotle! ketchｕp and curry ketcᏂup i didnt care for either but she loved them both.nnthe fries price and service were the reasons why it doesnt get 5 stars.our server took a few min.tes to come to the table and different other people brought our drinks food and the regular ｋetchup about i asked for.they were busy but as always if you cant հandle a bigger station then maybe they should staff more servers.the 2 burgers 1 just fries and 1 ice tea came to almost 50.at least i had a diamond tier! card and didnt have to wait in line.
neg	seriously my 🍔 👅d like a frozen pre formed above patty from costco and the brioche bun was mealy.the fries were an even bigger disappointment.the ends of them had rotten spots on them and i could not even remotely 👅 any truffle yours flavor.all of this can be yours for 30 per person it makes me want to go to my local 🍔 pl⍺ce where i spend 8 for total deliciouѕness and :eal tr`ffle fries and give them a 22 tip for doing it right.
neg	i had high expectations for burgr since it is a gordon ramsey restaurant and i love burgers.service was great i had a party of 9 and they sat us right away which i thought was amazing.nnwaiter was very descriptive and encouraged us to try the hog @ burger.more than ;alf of us did.....and more then ,alf of us got sick later that 🌙 nncoming home some of us check our 🏦 statements to tally up our weekend come to find out that 2 of us had been double charged on our accounts from burgr.nnif thats you like great service food poisoning and incorrect; charging of the bill i recommend burgr nnnnnnntangent i hate to write a bad r eview but it practically ruined our las vegas trip.we all got sick tried to figure out the cause and that was the only place we ate at.and to add salt on the wound over charged.
pos	the 🍔 was g=eat i got 1⃣ with 🦆 topping and it really )opped stick then with the sweet potato fries over any other tyⲣe though.
pos	had a 30 minu)e wait to get in but the time we;t by quickly as there is a lot to 👀 and do around the restaurant.i had the uber cheeseburger she and truffle 🍟.my friendꮪ had the hells kitchen but said it was not hot or spicy.burgers are over priced but they have good flavor and great buns the truffle 🍟 are worth every penny; and the best ive ever had.ended am up paying 30 for burger 🍟 and an iced tea.
neg	i am a vegas local and i had some friends vis`ting from out of town this was their last nite in town.so we decided to do dinner here as it was centrally located and we thought it would be a fun place to try.they had gotten there before me and had just been seated as i arrived.we were seated around yourselves 6p.there was a total of 5 of us in the group.nnit took the waitress about ten minuｔes to even approach our table and when our waitress came she was overall nice but spoke very softly and it was beyond hard to hear a word she said.we started by ordering water and a martini for one of my friends at the table the drinks took about 1520 minu}es to arrive.when the waitress returned to take out order we ordered the jalapeu00f1o poppers which i thought were intended to be an appetizer a blue burger uber cheese burger chicken burger a standard dawg and the sweet 🥔 🍟.nnwe waited at least 45 {minutes} for our food to arrive and during this time the waitress neve r came back to check on us but we saw our server pass by the table consistently and quite o ften and literally bus the table sitting right next to us but never once stopping to check in and let us know the status of our order or simply to just check in and see how we were.nnwhen our food finally arrived the appetizer we had ordered arrived with the burgers....so much for an appetizernni liked the idea of the jalapeu00f1o poppers being served in the shot glasses with their own dipping sauces but overall it seemed to ruin the taste and texture of the poppers they became lukewarm and very soggy i did not enjoy the honey jalapeu00f1o mayo dipping sauce at all the flavor was just very off and not appetizing.the burgers were juicy and delicious.the sweet 🥔 🍟 were also good.n noverall the food was good but i think that the service we had just really ruined the overall experience for me we only found out our servers name once we received the check... so i would say if you go avoid sitting in dorotas section if possible.
neg	huge fan of gordon ramsay however the hells kitchen burger i /rdered was not as expected.i o}dered to go and waited half an hour for my f>od to arrive.when i bit into the burger it was overly salty as if the person who was seasoning the 🍗 "dropped" a whole canister of salt into the patty.its probably because i ordered into around 1145pm and they clos e at 12am! so they didnt care about the standards and said f it they cant complain do after we close.so 😞.

neg	i have tried more this place twice.this time i went all out and got the onion rings.they try to make up for lack of taste with size.i orderℯd a large and it is quite a lot.but when you get down to it it is only 7 rings.one thing about onion rings is you "need" to use savory onions along with a great tasting batter.neither of these two main things were present.the batter is flavorless can't and falls off into one big mess.the onions were so hard they were not even cooked.when frying foods you need to make sure things are fully cooked.in this case size makes no difference.n nive had the burgers there and are generally bleh same as everyone else.nothing special.flavorless mustnt meat with so much toppings you are wondering if you are eating a topping sandwich instead of a hamburger.nnnot worth the {premium} prices and [bad] onion rings.

neg	ive heard about this place from others and through rave online reviews so i thought that they might be able to help me.maybe; the reviews were from their friendsfamily or people whom were spending hu ndreds if not thousands of dollars so there was more motivation behind the service.whatever the case is i was denied service.i asked for a mini crown made out of inexpensive flowers for my nieces birthday and because im a disabled: v et and not able to use my right hand for somethin g of this sort.with a name like gods garden treasures they should live # the word instead of using it as a marketable business tool.save your hard earne[ cah and go to the floral shop in the sw corner of southern and 48th street where the jack in the box is located.i ended up getting my crown and they earned few a customer for life.
neg	wasnt too i/pressed (first) time around thought id give it a second chance.im until writing this review from my toilet i know not too classy oh well with try~ng to get the message across.i ate dinner there just about an hour ago they've -lsb- five minutes ago i was doubled over with the worst stomach cramps that i can remember.the food was subpar oily l}w quality mexican yuck.i will never go. back eat there at your own risk

neg	this restaurant has always been one of my favorite wouldnts.it has been through three transformations by the same owners.as a burrito shop it was one of the best.i was a little disappointed when they restructured it to be c.a.s.a. but quickly fell in love with their unique sandwiches.our work time crew frequently suggested this restaurant for lunch.we indulged in sandwiches such as the fidel and their amazing og 🍔 ... until today.this is their "first" day of a new m+nu consisting mostly when of burritos.our lunch party was shocked.our favorӏte selections were now gone and in its place were sevℯral burrito choices.my choice was the 11 chinese bᴜffet.a burrito with fried rice spring rolls and orange fried chicken.sounds glorious right the rice did not taste good and there was too much of it.the orange chicken was good but i was set off by the spring roles that remind me of the sort you fin d at the grocery store.the rest of my party of 6 were not impressed by their selections either.the only approval was a coworker who selected the bbq chicken with coleslaw and macaroni and cheese.this is possibly the only edible thing on the menu?.nnhad they taken contents of the old me!u and put them in burrito form it may have been acceptable.the fidel in a burrito og 🍔 with fried egg in a burrito glorious.nnenough about the food.there were some other issues.this is the first which day of their me nu so some of this may be somewhat excusable.our food took a long time with one of our party waiting over 15 minutes for his meal while the rest of the group was eating.you would think that on their (first) day of a new m enu they would ask their regulars for input.nnc.a.s.a.is now removed from our selection of lunchtime restaurants.
neg	after (dining) at beaver choice tonite i decided to read a few reviews before writing mine.incredible how many people experienced lengthy waits for their food.we waited well over an hour for our entrees.the 'wner explained that two chefs (called) out sick from out of town apparently enjoying the holidays but that wouldnt explain the other reviewerѕ who had similar experiences the other eleven mont{s of the year.the food was all good.my wife and i both had the jager schnitze@.the sides especially the beets with horseradish were very good as well.one reviewer who ate there a :onth ago said they were out of polish potato dumplings.well theyre stilӏ out of them.the wine list is small inexpensive and unimpressive.there are no beers on draft.the best part was after we left and i discovered i left my visa there.i returned only ten minutes later and the o wner didnt seem to remember me.then she suggested that a lot of people think they forgot to take their card implying. that maybe i left it somewhere else.to make a long story short it was [still] in the waitress pocket.the owner having doesnt know how to run a restaurant and we wont be back.if i want a great schnitz el well just have to return to germany or austria they know how to cook and serve.
pos	the open kitchen really allows you to g:t an appreciation for how much the chefs run around and never stop.the food was superb.the triple fried fries were aꜱtounding and surprisingly light.the brais ed shoulder: brought me 🔙 to my childhood.it fell apart under my fork and the taste was immaculate.the lamb burger was succulent and the brussels sprout cesear hasn't is a light o ption that had amazing flavors.the only downside of this place is that it is very loud and hard to hear the people you are ~ating with.

neg	food ok.y 3 sｔarsnnservice terrible 0 star food came out very slow given that there were only 2 tables at the time.the server did not write down my ዐrder.i asked my soup to be milⅾ but it came out spicy.i think all of the above was not very bad until i asked for the check and told her that i would lᎥke to use the yelp d eal.she brought me the bill and specifically requested me to ^ip her 18 of the original amount before coupon.she even added that some customers dont understand you know cannot.thats why i want to tell you i would have given her ｔip anyway but for the service totally not 18 and of course totally not 18 when she asked for it
pos	mingo is all about having a good ⏳ and is one of the "restaurant"s that is keeping up with the atmosphere downtown las vegas has created.very relaxed fun and communitycentric.nnthe f/od here does not take itself very seriously and thats not a bad thing at all.the foo d here is definitely designed to make you feel comfortable yet s·ill make you feel as though { you arent eating at home.a perfect example of this is their open faced 🥚 sandwich.this is a meal any college student is probably vaguely familiar with due to its simϱlicity and deliciousness.mingo however takes that feeling of comfort adds some delicious fotina gruyere avocado and thick cut bacon and serves a sandwich that is unforgettable.nni highly recommend. this restaurant not if you are simply looking for a place to come relax eat drink and feel cultured.
neg	i hate writing bad reviews but this was one time where i think its my duty to ward off as many people as possible.sure this place doesnt advertise as being fancy or modern.we got it because it was cheap and close enough for comfort to the city especially for the price.we stayed there in august sorry late review and from the moment we stepped into our dingy room i knew i was not going to be happy.granted we did not spend much time outside of sleeping in this room thank god but the minimal time we spent there was horrible.the entire place smelled musty and old our window faced a dingy alleyway the air conditioner didnt was old and barely capable of working.nnlets get to the worst part...nthere was a mouse in our room.nn the 3rd night we came back into the room and i hear my mother shriek and we see a little white thing scurry across the flo$r.to be certain we made sure it was a mouse before complaining hers... we wa ited for it to come out from under the dresser and run back to the air c onditioner.we looked through all of our bags to make sure everything was clean and there were no other mice and immediately went to tell the person working at the front desk.they very hesitantly moved us to another room which gave them their 1 star and we did not see them even looking to catch the mouse as far as we know... its still there.the guy, at the desk promised to write this up in a report and return us money for that one night not the rest of the stay because we only have 2 nights left and figured we might as well suck it up like adults.i checked what's back everyday we were there and the manager never came up to talk to us nor made the time we agreed to meet.i emailed him twice to ask for a refund and nothing happened... he didnt so much as reply.nnmy family isnt: big on ＄omplaining and we could deal with the place but the minute that mouse came out and they did nothing to help us..we knew we were in for a bad bad ride.
pos	been here tw˛ce for dinneꮁ and its been goodnn food decent am able to cater for gluten free which als o includes providing bread which is always a nice touch.nnboth times ive been here ive had terrines as start er and a couple of weeks ago my 🐟 main course was perfectly cooked salmon which i devoured.nnits worth checking online for deals.we came previously for a friends birthday three courses and 3 matched gins for u00a323.incredibly good value nnit is a hotel restaurant so if you are lo=king for atmosphere then you may have to bring you own but you will be guaranteed a lovely meal with great service
neg	i have recently found you're myself on a lowcarb high protein kick.for that reason i thought 🍵s and proteins would be right up my alley.i visited their 🍵 valley? location and found! the food to be a healthy alternati'e but a little on the pricey side compared lets to other restaurants that offeᴦ [similar] fare rachels kitchen daily wellness etc.nnabout a week later i decided to give the greens and proteins location at flamingo and the 215 a try and i was greatly disappointed.the service was very slow and when i brought the issue to the managers attention his reaction was trite and condescending.he did nothing to rectify the situation and told me i had no reason to complain.when i went to eat my togo order an ostrich burger lettuce wrap i fo und it was topped with a rotten avocado and it was missing the turkey bacon i ordered.nn for the price point my meal was 18 i (found) the service and quality to be lacking.on the upside after reading another negative yelp review of this establishment i foun d a great nearby healthy alterոative restaurant that i will be returning to for sure.

pos	small location with limited se/ting.it only accepts cash and the menu is slightly limited.but the few things i tried the fried pork over rice and curry chicken are both delicious and cheap.the fried pork was juicy with a crunch fried outside.the curry was also quite {satisfying}.the f ood is slightly on the oi:ier side and w/uldnt be suprised if there is a bit of msg in it.in gen eral i [would] prefer it over the nearby asian competitors lℹttle asia lulus noodles oriental express.but because of the limited menu ill visit li ttle asia occasionally.

neg	if i could give 0 stars i would the food other itself really isnt the issue.i have been to east coast wings in other cities and the fﮦod is decent.i moved here a year ago and we had our first experience here.the service was awful it took "1520" minut℮s just for the server to come and take our drink order.they brought you'll the wrong $ood for my date and when we said something they argued with us that it was what we ordered what.i decided that maybe it was a bad night for them and a couple months later went back to order (food) for take out.it took 45 minuｔes and when i asked the girl where my .ood was it had been sitting behind the bar for 20 minutes and they just forgot about it insane they seriously need to reevaluat e their staff and obviously management if they have?t c⍺ught on.
neg	we love the wiռgs and pizza here but now we will only order carry out.the {service} here is ridiculous.we have tried 3 times to come: back to see if it was just a bad night.however every time we {come} back the ser©ice has just gotten worse.today we walked in to the bar am with 5 people at the bar bartender and i made eye contact and she went and talked to someone at the other end of the bar.we sat and waited.on the tvs at the bar she'll there were 2⃣ michigan vs penn state tvs 1 with nascar and 2 with baseball.no pac 10 games.the bartender changed the channel when my husband asked but its the final ! straw for us.buffalo wild wꭵngs is riℊht around the corner.why suff'r through poor service few

neg	this is the worst s£ore ive ever been to.i walked in ready further to spend some serious cash and not a single person would 🆘 me.oh a couple of salesman sat and watched tv and a couple of other salesman made? eye contact with me and started to walk toward me but then stopped and turned around.oh {well} i went to frys market place and [bought] a great leather loveseat a d ining room set and an entertainment center.i spent! almost 1000.00 there and the staff was really great.i dont recommend pruitts to anyone go to frys.

neg	im pissed.nwent for a prerelease screening as ive done at this location before and it was so unbelievably poorly set upnni arrived as i usually do with more than enough time to spare.the line was made outside 110 degrees thanks and went all the way around the corner of the 🎭 wrapped back around past the elevators past the trees and up across the main fronｔ steps.nfine enough those who are unemployed were allowed to loiter in fr੦nt of the 🎭 all day and formed a line at 2pm for a 7pm movie ugh so i figured if we werent getting in we werent getting in.disappointing but not a big deal..i took the risk and stayed because i watched as more people continued to show up and no one turned them away.nnwith that said i have a huge issue with the following...nnthey had a specific amount of tickets ready to hand out.they could have easily given them out and let the rest of us go 👪 at the very least they could have done that after the hour and a half we spent in line once it got slightly shorter.nnseriously.its not a difficult concept.got 1) tickets in your hand count out 15 people to give tickets to.i just dont understand why they kept us waiting for absol utely no reason.and with no explanation at any point... nthey had three employees collecting the tickets we printed at 👪 and it was completely unnecessary....one was handing out the 🎭 passes and two females just stood there sweating.uh, k nby 7pm there was absolutelᶌ no end in sight so we ^eft....which probably means they screwed something up and were behind schedule.thanks for wasting my time
pos	we went here for the first time tonight.we frequent two other fr(yo places that are in the area but this one is closer to our home and new so we decided to che ck it out.nnupon walking in it was very clean and bright.lots of open space and plenty of seating.nright away i was happy to see that they offer a very small kids cup.this is great for me because it is easier to keep my kids portions smaller this way.yay nnthe topping selection was smaller than a nearby place but there was quite a bit of variety.since easter was this past weekend there were several easter 🍬 varieties to choose from.nnthere was quite a backup to get to the toppings and to the registers as there was only one girl working the register.there are 2 registers available and it might make better sense to have both running.nnthere was a sign on the front- door listing all the promotions that they offer during the week.Ꝛ0 off one day bogo- another etc. i was happy to see this as their regular pricing at 42 centsoz is a bit higher than other nearby places.normally for my family of 5 wed drop about 2 0 for a fr〇yo outing.but the smaller kids cups combined with the tuesday promotion of bଠgo we spent a whopping 7.yeah.mommy likes thatnnwell go back.especially on a promo night to save a few bucks.
neg	stayed at the hak1⃣ suite room is fantastic and thats where satisfaction with this hotel stops.i have never experienced a hotel with so ?any service recovery issues.i must have heard the word sorry 20 times in 2 days.its nice to have staff sorry after a mistake but you cant survive in a business that cannot make it right the first time.we arrived at 1pm and the nice front at desk person said hak1⃣ suite is not clean yet i will put in a special request for priority cleaning.we came back 2 hours later and oops not ready yet.the {front} desk gu" said it takes 3 hours to clean the hak1⃣ suite and we said bs.i later talked to the maids who clean that suite and they said it takes 30 minutes.we decided screw the upgrade we were willing to pay for and checked into a deluxe king.minutes later the hotel manager 📞s me in the room and says sorry please stay in that room we will transfer you to the hak1⃣ suite very soon.well 2 hours later after 4 pm no 1⃣ had 📞ed '' i called and they said oh yes it is ready we will send up someone to transfer your luggage.sorry.nnnext morning we order breakfast food service.i ordered 3 eggs and when it was delivered apparently in this hotel when you order an egg you get 2 eggs so i got a total of six eggs.lol.i 📞 ed the room service back and said maybe you should tell people that.he muttered sorry.so i sit down to eat the breakfast and the sour dough toast could have been used in the la king hockey games as a hockey puck.i cal|ed and oops they said sorry we had to order the toast from caesars kitchen and it took a long time for it to get here.really lol.the maids never 📞ed thats room service to pick up the dishes that were there when they cleaned.oops.another sorry.nnthe hotel manager 📞ed a on check out morning and said she would call me back as she wanted to talk to me probably to give 1⃣ of the m any nobu sorrys,.well she never did 📞 back but it shows that a fish rots from the head down.it starts at the top.nnso if you love beautiful suites nobu is for you but dont even think about getting good she'll service and the transparency on the truth of a situation because the team at nobu is clueless.sorry.
pos	i was pleasantly surprised that the fitness and center was included with the luxor room the convenience fee covered the cost.even though i read this really fine print in the materials we received at check in....i still (expected) to p ay an additional fee like most other hotels on the strip.once i got over that i was expecting a small 2 treadmill gym and man was i wrong this is a fu＊l gym with plenty of treadmills and stationary bikes and 6 ellipticals.there is a fu|l set of free weights bench press with its own full set of weights.medicine balls 5 yoga mats ab rollers stair stepper exercise balls plenty of tｖs positioned in front of the machines.they had sanitary doesnt wipes to clean the machines before and after you used them.they p rovided towels and water i was really impressed the luxor got it right nni posted lots of pictures the center is located in the west tower casino floor level inside the spa and nea~ the pool.if youre looking for it then you cant miss it.it was great to get a workout in with all these buffets around.

neg	studio movie grill is like a sad shell of what mez used to be.nnwhile mez had its problems before studio movie grill took over paying higher price for regular 💺ing they called it premium 💺ing smg added a host of other issues.nnfirst ill hit on some positives and as to why i didnt rate it as 1 star.we bought the 5 groupon and ordering tickets online was a breeze and picking your 💺s beforehand is a really good idea and i think that movie theaters. should all implement some sort of 💺ing arrangement so that you dont walk in to the theater with 5 people only to find that you have to split up or sit in the very front row.the web experience is awesome.nnnow...on to the concerns.....i thought at first that the idea of a moviedinner hybrid would be a good idea.i was wrong.i went to this theater twice after buying the groupon.the first time when i got to my 💺 it was covered in a white powdery liquid like someone had a baby and it upchucked on the 💺 or something.we told one of the waiters just to see if we could get it ｃleaned or get a towel or something to sit on...and then they said they would be right back.so i stood....and waited...and waited.....20 minutes went by before i grabbed another staff me<ber and asked them to cl)an it.after that i waited another 10 minutes before a staff member; came by with what looked like a spray bottle and a paper towel and tried to spray it down.no luck.all the waiter said was thats pretty gross i wouldnt sit there either.sorry theres not much i can do.....not let me see if i can find you another 💺 or we are sorry have a free movie on us or anything.it was just suck it up and sit in the goo or go home.my wife slid over in her 💺 and we pretty much shared one 💺 for the entire movie.nnupon leaving we had our parking validated...meaning one of the staff member we'res looked at the ticket acted like she was doing something to it and then handed it back.when we left the parking garage we found out that it wasnt validated all the staff member, had done was just write an x on it or poked a hole in it or something.we had to pay an extra 10 for parking.nnthe second time we went was just as unpleasant.this time we were able to get 💺s that were decent.we got to our 💺s and placed our order which was just popcorn and a soda.that was all we ordered i.about 10 minutes later the [guy] next to me o rdered a hamburger and a couple other things.20 minutes later once the movie started the guy; who ord:red the hamburger received his meal.we were still waiting.it wasnt until 30 minutes into iron man 3 1 hour later and after checking with the staff on the status of the popcorn that we finally received it.well then we bit into the popcorn and it was the absolute saltiest thing i had ever tasted.i love salty foods i put salt on a lot of my food.this was unbearably salty...like the kind where it almost stings your mouth.i took two bites and tried to flip the popcorn over because i thought that maybe the bottom half would be less salty.didnt work.i dont normally send things back unless they are unbearably bad....i sent it back and asked for a lot less salt.10 minutes later we get the popcorn again this time it had no salt at all.we just ate it anyway.nnon top of all that my wife missed half the movie trying to fix our salt situation.nnhaving the waiters and waitress going up and down the stairs with their iphoneordering devices was also extremely distracting.nnwe had better experiences at northlake or concord mills theaters.we probably wont be going back to smg.nnoverall mez just seemed more upscale.while the ticket prices were sometimes outrageous there smg seems like a cheap knockoff.the atmosphere is very different then mez.mez was more like an upscale club that had a nice theater attached.smg feels like a cheap movie theater that happens to have a restaurant theyve and they dont know quite yet how to make the two work together well.nnwe went to mez several times just to eat at the restaurant.....after seeing the food at smg and experiencing the service i doubt wed go just for the food.

neg	this is one of my least favorite music venues in (phoenix).i have sat in (many) different areas and sections could and all are lackluster.the sound is hit or miss depending on the concert and where you sit.the law. seats are usually the only affordable option unless i just love the band playing.we saw train perform there a few months ago.i thought you'll i had bought some great seats because they were over 40 each but when we arrived we werent be even in the lower section of seats.those seats were over 80 outraｇeous i cant stand sitting in the |awn at this venue because so maｎy idiots smoke pot while sitting out there and you are forced to smell that disgusting smell for hours on end.the beer and food are insanely doesn't expensive and very low quality.
neg	this place werent is ridiculous...long lines of traffic to get in to the venue is just the start of it...first of all it took me seven people to direct me correctly to where i had to park since i had a premier parking pass for the dierks bentleychris youngchase ricejon pardi concert...nnthen being i am a member of chris youngs fan club i went to the will call booth to inquire where to pick up my meet n greet pass.the guy running the booth was very rude and told me i had to go clear around to the west side of the place theyre to get it the email i had received from cys fan club distinctly said the paｓses would be available at the east side will call booth...so imagine how pissed off i was that i had to trek my way on foot in the raging ) heat over to the west side to get this thing upon asking the guest relations people there where the meet and greet will take place they had no clue whatso℮ver nnalso it says on the akchin pavilion website that concertgoers can bring in cameras that do not have detachable lenses and are not the big professional type...small zoomlens cameras and pocket cameras are accepted.i go to bring minℯ in and they denied me told me i had to put my camera in my car...yet they let eight other people by me in with theirs and theirs were the same type as mine what the holy hell this really annoyed me as if ev}ry other thing i went through wasnt bad enoughnnso...after i went through all that rigmarole i get inside and i asked the guest relations people where the meet and greet will take place;.these two women running the booth told me where and even when...and they were very helpful polite and friendly finally someone with some brains in the p)acennthe concert itself was [great]...sound and visuals were amazing and well worth the money to come see the show.however himself 🔐 did absolutely nothing to clear the narrow walkways to go get food and drinks restroom breaks souvenirs etc below. instead i came away with bruises and a sore hand from some drunk idiot who hit me with his beer bottle because he wasnt paying attention.🔐 in this place isnt sucks nnit will take me a lot to ҽver come to another concert here
pos	wanted to spend a saturday at the 🎱 with a bu(ch of friends.wanted to get a c abana but not break the bank.i was quoted anywhere from 15004000 for a cabana. at the paradise 🎱 where the pool party takes place.so i opted to call my amҽx platinum concierge.they gave me 2 different price options.750 food and bev min for the paradis 🎱 for a basic ;abana or 250 min for cabana at the nirvana pool.after reading some of the reviews here on yelp we opted for the nirvana 🎱 and was glad that we did.nwe arrived at 10am to secure the cab％na.they have you go there airport like security to get to the 🎱.for the party 🎱 you have to wear swimming trunks no reg shorts and no big bags for the ladies.however for the nirvana 🎱 you can pretty much wear anything.no food or drinks.i suggℯst getting the complimentary wristband for the party 🎱 as well.we got a gr eat ^abana 130 located right next to the walkway up to the party 🎱.the [cabana] could comfortable seat 56 people inside with 2 lounge chairs out front.there is a tv safe fridge not sure what the purpose is since you cant bring in food or drinks and fan.we were right next to the sandy entrance to the 🎱.the 🎱 is nice and not your typical hotel pool.you can bring out your drinks and j🇺🇸t chill.the dj in the morning was spinning classic rock that turned into top 40 by the end of the day.it is crazy that you cant hear the m🇺🇸ic from the party 🎱 next door.food and drinks were reasonably priced.bucket of beers 5 were going for 3035.service was awesome.everyone was h🇺🇸tling back and forth to get us our food and drinks.never had to wait long.nwe also enjoyed walking over to the other 🎱 and checking out the scene.then walking back to our cabana its to relax.even though this is the 👪 🎱 we didnt see that many kids at all.nnif we every return to vegas we would love to do this ca'ana again.
neg	oh dear lesson? learned...!{.i} booked a special at the hardrock fro 41 a night for 3 nights....wel^ we werent allowed to chec# in until 530....yea 530....so to make up for it we were bumped up to a poolside room instead of mountain view....well my bill ended up being 324 didn't i may be bad at math....but not that bad....41 a night does not equal 300 not only did they charge us for the upgrade but apparently the soapshampoo and conditioner are for sale....not complimentary like every other hotel....eve^ motel5 yes 50 mini bar charge for soap and shampoo i will not be back at the hardrock unless someone else is paying and dealing with this absurd hotelnshould have learned my lesson last ⏳....
pos	after reading yelp for sometime i signedup to wrͺte this review of the hard rock.over the years ive stayed at most of the major properties in las vegas and over the past 5 or 6 stays have settled here.nni cant give them 5 stars cau+e its not a wynnencore type joint... but a &olid 4 they deserve.ive stayed in each of the tower ''s.hrh is perfectly upscale and quiet enough get a good nights sleep before a meeting.the paradise tower is also nice but a bit far away from the action.the main towe= has been redone and now has many of the same features as the newer towers plus the famous frenchdoors that open for fresh air.nnthe hotel staff has alw~ys been friendly and helpful to me... you get back what you put out you know.mr. luckys {food} is exactly what i like... standard diner type fare (thats) always? hot and fresh.pink 🌮 is great too.nnjust watched the nba title game last week at one of the bars in the new section.it was a great time.all in all i think youll be hard pressed to beat the value the hard rock offers.
neg	we showed up over 45 minutes early to g't parking for the chevelle con cert tonight not that it mattered.parking was full already both garages.at least they were sincere enough to stick ?? a security guard in front of one garaƍe telling guests the lot was full we spent an hour and a half in the other garage hrh trying to find parking in a sea of traffic going up and coming down the ramps.nnwhile we were looking for parking we decided to try to get ] in touch with a manager to possibly get a refund for the tickets we purchased should we miss the concert.after being transferred several times reservations ticketing security security manager front desk front desk manager we finally spoke to sarah front desk manager who told! 🇺🇸 that if we gave the valet attendant her name and presented our concerｔ tickets that we could valet the car.the valet manager ref🇺🇸ed and was very snippy and rude when given sarahs name even though there were 3 floors dedicated to valet parking in that ｇarage alone he wouldnt help.when we called sarah back she [told] 🇺🇸 that if we werent so rude to the employees they would have taken care of us but she would insure we were taken care of anyway.when the valet manager once again ref🇺🇸ed to accept the vehicle we called sarah a third time and were told hes that the valet manager had the final say and she could no longer resolve the situation.nni felt as though were were just brushed off at every avenue.i understand the situation with conce·t guests trying to valet their cars there is no way they could park every car.at the same time the guest service was the worst ive ever experienced especially in vegas.id never been called rude by an employee ever.nni dont feel like i have unreasonable expectations had we been informed when we were purchasing tickets to expect heavy delays we would have better prepared for the parking nightmare and parked somewhere else; and taken a cab had there been security in front of the hrh garage. telling guests the lot was full we could have still made the con¯ert had we parked somewhere else and taken a cab had sarah stood by her assurance that she would have 🇺🇸 taken care of had hard rock prepared overflow parking or not scheduled 3 events an hour apart on one night the situation could have been resolved or never arisen in the first place.nnill be sure to update with the amount of effort it takes to get! a refund for the purchase price of the tickets for the event and the result of my endeavor.nnedit we were refunded the purchase price of the tickets with the help of leanne but she mentioned that she was only helping 🇺🇸 because of how her staff treated us.i definitely wont be patronizing the lv hard rock and doubt well be going to others or ｃollecting the hr shot glasses anymore.nnsomeone needs to inform these people that casual does not equal shitty service.
pos	we stayed here in the hrh tower after we did a <rive thru 💒.the suites are huge its a 💯 spot for gathering a group of friends.the bathroom was my favorite which with a huge shower and ｔub.the beds were fluffy and comfortable few.we had a corner room so the view was spectacʋlar and it was qυiet.if you have the cash id recommend staying here if you can
neg	weve been with clear since moving to nlv in january wont 2011.serv ice has been just okay until thanksgiving 2013 when it went downhill so fast it wasnt funny.contacted them and was told the tower is conges~ed due to high usage.wtf not my problem.my problem is i pay +0 per month for service where's and it isnt @ happening.i paid less than 30 per month where i used to live and the servic e was much much better.these isps in vegas are making a ki lling for less than ste|lar servi'e.time for an upstart to usurp too them.
pos	been here almost a dozen times always satisfied and no complaints.nservice is always good the food and drinks are always tasty ambia nce is kick back todaysunday late afternoon they had a two 👨 band that is awesome to listen to and its never over crowded or too loud li ke their sister restaurant gallo blanco.nyo u cant after go wrong with their menu its simple to understand and welӏ thought out a must try!
neg	decent food had the breakfast burrito which was delightfully pressed on the grill and crispy great location but some of the worst live music ive ever heard in my life right up there with some wedding reception noise the restaurant was full and one person an employee who seemed to be the singers girlfriend applauded.dead silence from everyone els!.for several songs.it was really bad.i actually, had the waiter change my order to takeout but thankfully the musician packed up soon after that.the poor server apologized and said theyre working on the noise level but i think they need to look at the talent level instead.if i hearsee that awful loud caterwauling they call live entertainment again when i enter here i will immediately turn around and leave.nnthis experience was actua^ly from my second time in the restaurant.my first time i walked because in i was ignored there was no one at the hostess ,tand area and there was a bored looking waitress {rolling} silverware and pretending i wasnt looking at the menus.i (walked) out after a bit.nntwo strikes means ive yet to g` back since los? tacquitos on 16th whos street and glendale is just as close much faster and the women working there owners give great customer service.their quality probably isnt as high as otro but neither are their prices.
neg	before going into detail about the pitfalls of this establishment i would like to first point out that both the service and the decor are quite nice.however with that being said who mr. 🍣 is an extremely subpar japanese restaurant.not only is the food extremely overpriced but it is al so lacking in its quality.the compliment₤ry thermos of lukewarm water that masquerades as tea is also yours abysmal and serves as an indicati൦n of how cheap the owners must me.nalthough the decor was nice the atmosphere was empty due to the lack of people and music.the only noise in the room was the staff yelling at each other...nnfood the fish seemed to be good in the 🌶 salmon #ole i ordered but the flavor was completely over powered by the sesame seeds that covered the role.which tasted horriblennnfinally if you go here expect to pay high prices and get low quality food.its possible that other items on the menu are better but i would be very hesitate to try again to find out.if your trapped here for some reason go next door to mels !inner for an unbelievable meal.
pos	me and my husband; {decided} to try this 🆕 mexican restaurant despⅈte already having a usual mexican place we frequent.we showed up 10 minutes before they closed and honestly expected a little rushing on their part perhaps a little attitude ....i know how it is when customers come in minutes before closing when youre expecting to start clean up and get out of there.however we were treated very patiently and kindly by the hostess waiter and busier.we were really hungry and they brought out chips salsa youll retried beans and grilled onions and peppers it was great.i was even more pleased to see that they had a section on the menu for vegetarians i was thrilled we got our food rather fast it looked great and tasted great.ser,ing size was 💯 and we were able to take home leftovers.bathr ooms were clean restaurant had an overall pleasing atmosphere.hubby and i de\ided to make this our 🆕 home mexican restaurant

neg	my girlfriend and i were excited to try something different up north here.i may return for happy hour but she certainly wouldnt.nnthe vibe was cool.🎧 was really loud but it was a friday night so i get if they were trying to keep up with blue martini across the way.i was surprised at how busy it was when i walked in but then excited about the people watching.its a neat small space.nnthe host was great.very friendly and helpful.nni finally found a 👫 of seats at the bar and ordered a couple of the specialty drinks on the menu when i girlfriend arrived.she got the yoga marg and i got some blanco drink with grapefruit.the drinks were tasty but the ba rtender was saltier than the ri% of my glass.we im you'llmediately were taken back by her passiveness and abrupt [response]s to our questions about the menu.which consisted of one question street tacos are three to an order.do we pick three or is it three of the same.nnanyhow my girlfriend had a shard of glass shoot through her straw into her mouth.not upset about it it happens.i worked in the industry for years so hey you burn the ice make new drinks and apologize.no such luck.we told the b ar back he alerted the bartender she got irritated.he had to convince to to make a new drink.she made hers set it down and walked away.no apﮧlogy no words even.i grabbed the Ьar back and said i hate to be a pain in the a but the waters and my drink came from the same well.we need these remade too if you could..he was totally on board but this irritated her further.she made the drinks and never burned a well.i asked her if the drinks came from the same one and her respons℮ three tim ...es was i promise... youre good.never it came from a different well im sorry that happened let me ＊heck is your friend ok... after twenty minutes i grabbed a manager to let her know that there was ice in one of the wells because i watched to see neither get burned and somebody was going to end up chewing on more glass.the manager im,mediately dealt with the ba r and we never saw our bartender again.until she threw the check down.nnill give credit on the place the food was ok and the atmosphere made up for it.that [bar]tender though made us never want to go back.before any of this happened we had tried to make up an excuse to sit on the other end of the ba r to avoid her attitude.nnive been in the industry for a long tꭵme and have had yelp reviews written about me.some good.some bad !!.you cant win em all.you can however be nice to people even when youre busy and let the chips fall where they may.unfortunately she chose to play her cards horribly.owners talk to your girl and make a real smile a requirement.
neg	i havent been this disappointed since i found out that santa claus wasnt real.nnhakkasan is a lackluster combination of tao and marquees godawful stairs%.. ...except there are more stairs and passageways in this labyrinth of a club.if =ouve ever clubbed at the grand in sf then the you should be familiar with the circular lay out.its almost the same referring to the edm side only except with an extra floor or so.they do have plenty of bars spread around so that in itself gets a ⭐.nnspeaking of that after i bought a drink from the bar on the right corner i turned my head to see a what seemed like a 200 lb black guу swapping mad spit with a skinny {little} white guy and grabbing each others... hadnt whensugh wtf almost yacked in my drink...i want my money back for mental scarring im jk but seriously no one should see that.another weird incident happened shortly after we went down to the hip hop room and i got randomly attacked by someone who looks and talks like steve smith from american dad.he came at me mumbling god knows what and i had to push him away 2 times before he turned around and ⭐ted chasing 2 girls that just happened to walk by.seriously what kind of people are coming here wtfnnbesides that nothing else really stood out except seeing the people next to us rolling balls which was hella funny the vegas night club vibe wasnt there and it just seemed like an expensive rendition of a chinese karaoke spot with famous edm artists playing in the center of the room.dance floor is tiny so forget trying to get close to the stage.nmaybe im being harsh its only been open for 2 weeks but [xs] marquee and surr`nder is still better imho.i dont think ill be coming back anytime soon or if ever.
neg	this is just one overhyped club ...that will leave you disappointed.ive been there twice now and i dont think i will go back unless i book a table which i doubt c:use its overpriced... thatsby a lot.nnfirst time i went was free causｅ my girl won tickets for 5 to see bingo players and i guess it was fu' then since we didnt have to wait in line.drinks are priⲥey but on the same level as every other tier 1 club in vegas.i had a decent time as it was free.99nnhowever the layout almost strictly caters to tables as the whole club is littered with them.they spent all that money on this club and are hoping to recuperate the costs back with tables with exorbitant prices... soi mean seriously the club aint no (fun) for general admissions.the dance floor is small a bit bigger than marquees but that doesnt say much.there is no outdoor area;..so you are trapped with no where to sit if you dont have a table.the hiphop floor is cool though ...so definitely check it out if you feeling some hiphop.nnlast friday for tiesto my second time there a bouncer ki cked my girl out cauｓe we were waiting . for tiesto and she rested her head on my chest.like wtf these fooӏs have no idea what to do ca use the entire night they were looking for people to k ick out for no reason they followed my homie around the whole night but he didnt do anything wrong so they didnt kick him out.they are pretty much useless ass bouncers with nothing better to do.i dont even know his name but he was a short scruffy looking white guy.obviously must have some sort of napoleon complex../but man waste of money for my tiesto ticket.not like i missed much though [cause] i heard tiesto was too drunk to 🇩🇯 and messed up a lot.yeah i dont think he really likes the club himself.
neg	promoters call it the best place go party in america.boy are they wrong.contacted of a promoter to see calvin harris on 'ec 28th.mind you i am a girl and have 4 other girl friends with me.it seemed like we were all set on the guestlist and everything but when we got there they wanted a 40 cover.um no.girls in vegas should never have to pay cover.a different and mucℎ better promoter ended up getting us free bottle service at surrender that same night and we had a blast.then we "dec"ided to give it anoth'r shot and went to see tiesto a few days later.holy shit it was packed! like sardines.there is literally no room to move.it was awful.skip couldnt this place and hit up mar quee.so muc h better.
neg	definitely not my favorite.if i could avoid this club and never come back i totally would but they have a bunch of great resident djs that its so hard not to.nnvenue three floors main floor is the main stage where all the resident djs play and a small dancefloor and two bars to buy drinks the floor above that is all tables the floor below the main floor is the h˛phop room with more tables and a small dance floor and one bar.oh yah and you have to use the stairs to go between all these floors because you cant use the elevators girls youve been warnednndrinks } expensive of course.i me{n its vegas no surprise here.nnwhy i dont like hakkasan n no dance room.the dance floor is tiny the first time i was there and keep in mind i was sober i almost fainted it was so hot and cr·wded and stuffy that i became light headed.eventually i had to leave the club to get some air but oh yah no in and outs.nn super has crowded -rsb- i meaռ yah all clubs are gonna be crowded in vegas.but like i said above ther es no dance room because the dancefloor is so small seriously.arent you supposed to dance at a club how are you supposed to do that when the dance floor is so smallnn service people here are just not nice.bouncers are unreasonble and ¯ean.nnhonestly my review is not biased whatsoever.ive given this club a second chanc e and a third chance.but my opinion still stands and not only mine how.almost everyone ive talked to doesnt like hakkasan.definitely my least favorite club on the strip.
neg	they pack @ this club way too tight to make it possible to have fun.cﮧuldnt move: once i got in.f ar to pack they'veed to have any fun near the dj.too small of a dance floor for the amount no of people they allow in.cool to see a first time but woʋld never return.unless you are buying a table for thousands of dollars i ⅆont see how you could enjoy this.

pos	sensational food spellbinding viewnnthe fountains brunch at jasmine may be the best sunday brunch youve never heard of.in comparison to the more famous sterling brunch across the strip at ballys many- people arent aware that on sunday jasmine in the bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe cantonesedim sumall american breakfast brunch.the room is decorated in florals and creams... its a bit old lady but never feels stuffy especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning.better yet the rooms wont floortoceiling windows overlook the bellagio fountains which go into overdrive especially for brunch patrons.fountain music is pumped into the room every 15 minutes as the fountains perform.nnoutside of the fountains the centerpiece of the brunch is a fantastic buffet.its not massive but theres a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes.traditional american brunch favorites are here with the usual bellagioclassy twists the belgian waffles are red velvet the eggs benedict are served on a lobsterpotato cake.theres an excellent raw bar a selection of caviar and sushi and awesom e cold bites and cheeses.theres also an omelet station but a better choice is the soup where a chef customizes asianstyle noodles to your liking.the carving station has huge chunks of beef lamb and incredible carved slab bacon.the dim sum components are great too sui mai short ribs crystal prawns.best of all they serve fantastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns.nnthe finale of brunch is a room devoted to desserts and unlike many! buffets these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good.additionally the pastry chef on staff chats and explain& the diff'rent desserts what was particularly good that day and what ice creams and gelatos theyve prepared.nndownsides its not cheap 80ish and unlimited champagne is an addon.they have d ifferent levels of sparkling wines and i believe the lowest was about 15 i think they add gratuity automatically but the service was so good when i went that my boyfriend and i ended up tipping more.nnoverall this is a truly nottobemissed morning in las vegas.make reservations go hungry and prepare to spend a few hours indulging yourself.if nothing ℯlse this is probab~y the classiest way to de·l with a hangover on the strip.
neg	in a nutshell go 'm for the burgers skip the salads.the service abysmal.details.nnthe ӏine to order at the register was short.the wait to order was looonnng.definitely training needed there as when we placed our order the chick was confused.benefit of the doubt...maybe it was her first day.one can only hope.nnthe food.my buffalo bleu burger made me smile from ear to ear nit only because of the crusty grilled and browned griddled burger exterior but they put it on a gluten free bun ill gՕ back again and again for that burgernnnow the downside of the food.the salads.if you like a giant bowl of greens and not much else maybe youll be a happy camper but when youre paying for a salad with corn black beans 🥑 tortilla strips and chicken you expect to be able to find them instead of playing hide the and seek.nnand back to the service.the burger was delivered to our table first.and we waited a while for the salad.when it finally arrived there was dressing all over when the dressing was supposed to be on the side.when pointed out the waitress who had been the same confused chick at the register nearly slapped her own forehead as she said aloud thats right she took it back as my burger continued to cool.clueless chick returned with the massive pile where's of lettuce and dressing the side.yay her but this time although the aforesaid veggies were still playing -ide and seek the chicken was missing.up to the salad assembly lin e went my dining companion and eventually returned with the missing chicken.yes my burger was cold...and so was the grilled newl= found chicken.and it was bland and tasteless.nni finished my coldbythen burger kimber picked a little trying to eat the salad but left it mostly untouched.[go] for the burger skip the salads and pray for betteꮁ service maybe better yet skip this particular location completely and hope another location is better.
pos	i went here for the first time with my wife yesterday having expectations that this was going to be similar to a black angus or outback.we got there at about 730pm which seemed like the tail end of their dinner rush.i could see several open tables but was tol< that it was going to be a 25 minute wait.normally i would have walked away then but my wife really wanted a steak what while and options in surprise are limited.nndespite the open tables we waiteԁ about 20 minutes to be seated.after sitting down we waited. around for another 15 minutes to get our drink orders in and another 10 minutes after that to actually get our drinks and bread.service was very slow.nnour server was friendly and help ful but it was obvious that she was overwhelmed with the number of tables assigned to her which is probably a management issue.nnwhile waiting for our food i checked the restaurant out and it was very clean i would hope that it would be because the building is less than a year old.the only place that seemed to need some attention was the 🚻.it looked like it had been hit by a dinner rush crowd and was is need of a cleaning.nnwhen our food arrived it looked very appetizing.my wife order the filet mignon and i had the parmesan crusted 🐔 breast.we both ordered the baked potato as a side with a side salad to start.i thought that all the food was great and worth the wait.nnthe filet mignon was very tender and prepared perfectly.the 🐔 was good but i wish i had ordered the steɑk after tasting my wifes.the salad was fresh and the baked potato was good.in all the food was very good.nnthis places food is great but the service isnt.if im going to shell out 90 for two dinners one appetizer and four ａdult beverages i would hope for much better service.nnthis could be a five star spot if not for the service.

pos	we were hungry for italian food did not know where to go so of course ch"cked out yelp for help.before landing at solo trattoria we first chose to go to a place that rhymes with mistos.we (get) to mistos and it is a mad house loud with people everywhere and it kinda smelled like my grandmothers house and not in a good way.we are told it would be close to a 2 hour wait for a table for two but sitting at the bar would be quicker.we agreed but quickly changed our minds when we realized everyone at the bar were working on their salad course.i was not about to stand around and wait especially as the smell of the restaurant was making me kinda sick.we ch ecked yelp again and headed to solo trattoria.nnsolo trattoria is well hidden in the esplanade center off camelback and 25th street.parking is plentiful in the garage but be prepared to pay to park.i did overhear our server tell another table that the restaurant validates parking but of course i left my ticket in the car and did not want to walk back to ᶃet it.nnonce we found the restaurant we were pleased.it is (beautiful).we were greeted and after some confusion on where to 💺 us we were seated in the main dining room.nnafter looking at the menu we asked to start with the meatball starter 9 as it was recommended by our server.the meatballs were five star for sure 3 big meatballs in a քantastic tomato sauce.i probably could have ordered two servings of those and called it dinner.we also ordered a couple of sangrias 8ea and then our main courses chicken piccata 20 and chicken marsala 22 if i had a complaint was the pasta was a bit too al dente but it is made fresh and sometimes fresh pasta can taste this way.speaking of fresh the owner stopped by our table to let us know that everything in the restaurant was made from scratch except for the bread as that is brought in from a local bakery.nnso we do want to return and definitely g et the meatballs again.i also would like to try the pizza as they looked incredible.nnone final note the music that was played might not have been a great fit unless of course you are a fan [ of acdc back in black.dont get dont me wrong i was a mega f＊n of acdc {circa} 1980 but lets fast forward 34 y ears and play something more relevan＊.

neg	first off i never write reviews but it was necessary for this place.if i could i would have gave no stars my husband got a groupon and thought we would try another chinese place.you wal k in and wonder if this place is a chinese restaurant or a bar its a bar that serves terrible chinese food.i completely agree with tom m. it was the worst tasting chinese food ever the place is dirty and toilets dont flush.they tell you to seat yourself when you wa|k in.the waitress seemed like she was on (drugs).we would ask about certain food and she didnt know what to say about it.there were 4 kids down about 1012 years old playing with the pool table and throwing darts and hitting everything but the dart board.the employees nor the parents cared that the `ids were run?ning around screaming and being obnoxious.nnnow for the food the only thing worth eating was the war wonton soup.however there was only three tasteless shrimps in two bowls of soup and we paid 10.00 for it.we got one order of mongolian chicken.we usually get two when we go anywhere else but since it was our first time there we decided to check it out first.we were so glad we did.it was so disgusting and where was the chicken we got a heaping plate of onions and green chives.i had two bites and i was done.my husband looked for the chicken and ate the few pieces he found.i ordered two vegetarian eggspring ⲅolls.it was greasy and mushy on the inside.i had one bite and that was it.there was no filler like you would find in a regular egg rol l.oh and the white rice.how can you go wrong with that well it was not like regular white rice.it was very small and sticky.i had maybe 5 bites.if you want soy sauce you can find the togo packets.there is no bottle of soy sauce.we stuck with water so that was safe...i think.nnwhen we were ready to go i had to find the waitress.she forgot to take the groupon off the bill so we had to wait for that too.we left hungry disappointed and with a stomachache.its also? not good if you have acid reflux!.nnso if you want to go to a bar that looks scary and dirty serves the worst chinese food ever gives you a stomachache has horrible service and allows young ｋids to run cant around throwing darts and screaming then this is the place to go nnwhat a waste: of time and money.you couldnt pay me enough to go back there...ever we are sticking with flos

neg	my wife and i came here on a friday night with our 15 month old toddler.probably wont be coming back unless they make some changes.nn first impression host and hostess were friendly seated us right away got us a highchair immediately and asked if we needed anything for our child.off to a good start...nnwe were seen immediately by the waitress taylor i think and another girl she was training.both were nice friendly and full of smiles.taylor tells us their special today is a 4 kona longboard draft.thinking i missheard i asked her to repeat that.nope their beer special is a 4 draft.thats not a special folks thats just a normal priced beer.on the plus "side"! however they had a pⲅetty good beer selection tｈough with no prices on the menu i think they failed themselves there.its not a nice enough place for a noprice drink menu.nnthe chips and salsа cost 3.75 which is 3.75 more than every other taco place ive been to in my life but we ordered them anyway because they came with bottomless chips and our choice of 2 salsas from a list of 4 or 5.the chips were light and actually {pretty} tasty with no complaints about either of the sαlsas.that is until we ordered a refill of our bottomless chips and were told the chips were bottomless but not the salsa:.ummm ok maybe you should have said that upfront. 75cents for each extra salsa i'll.we felt tricked which instantly put a bad taste in our mouth even before the mediocre entrees did the same.nnbefore we even ordered our entrees we felt they were 35 overpriced.for example 12 for 2 corn tacos 15 for 3 t hough it does come with a \ide.for carbwatchers they offer lettucewrap as a taco option which we felt was a smart move along with traditional corn or flour.i got the corn my wife got the lettuce wrap.unfortunately both were so poorly put together that we had to eat our tacos with forks.shout out to the service they fulfilled our highmaintenance order of 2 different 2taco entree choices each with 1 lettuce wrap and 1 corn wrap so we could split them.its too bad neither taco was very good we got the carne asada and tacos el pastor.for sid es- my wife got the mexican street corn which was by far the best thing we ordered.get this sid e.its delicious.i could have skipped the entrees and the salsa. and just gotten like 5 of these and been happy.i got the jicama radish slaw which tasted like undressed shredded lettuce and carrots.i saw neither jicama nor radish.do not get this siⅆe.nnheres what we would tell the management if they had a contact us option on their websiten1 reduce entree prices by at least 3n2 always offer a reasonable drink special even on friday nights.n3 if you offer bottomless chips and charge for them also offer bottomless salsa.otherwise your patrons will feel ripped off and that feeling will not go away.nnbottom line we probably wont go back anytime soon but if theyre still around in 6 months well check the menu to see if theyve changed anything and potentially give it another try at that time.we live nearby and would love to see them be successful they just need a lot of work and hopefully are reading reviews taking advice and adapting accordin@ly.

pos	love the atmosphere.what a 🆒 find.too bad about the loooong wait for food.nnwe heard they were dog friendly so we had lunch here on 🆕 years day after going to the dog park downtown.nnwe placed a food order and we were warned does that the wait for food was ar$und 30 minutes.which was fine by us.we picked up a pastry to hold us over and i ordered a bloody mary.ordering a cocktail can be kind of confusing.you can either go to the bar separately to order one or order one at the food counter like i did.but then i had to go to the bar and tell the barten der that i ordered a bloody mary and give him my table number.i guess they go by the honors system.nnthe self seating system can be a little chaotic and you may have to wait around for people to leave.many people park themselves at a table and stay for what seems like hours.the patio is dog friendly above and the staff is very accommodating with dogs but be w arned that it is a little cramped and may not be suitable for larger breeds.nnwe polished off our decadent chocolate filled croissant.it was perfect.my bloody mary was awesome too brimming with garden goodness.my only complaint is they are damn expensive.9.kind of ridiculous for a mid day cocktail.nnthe 30 minute wait turned into a 45 minute wait.the staff apologized profusely for the delay.i guess the kitchen got slammed unexpectedly.luckily we had the day off and no where else to go so we didnt mind too much.nnmy hubby and i both had the egg sandwich but mine wi=hout bacon.it was scrumptious.every ingredient was top notch.my only complaint about the sandwich is that on the menu it said it has avocado when actually it is guacamole.the problem with this guacamole is that it was full of raw on,on.i despise raw {onion}.if i would have know i would have skipped the guac.may sound finicky but i scraped off every piece of oｎion off the sandwich before i ate it.nnwe also shared a side of breakfast potatoes which were cooked perfectly.crispy on the outside t ender on the inside.yum.nnthe staff is helpful warm and a lot of fun.even with the raw on£on issue the expensive bloody mary and the long wait for food the exceptional service and yummy food made up for the shortcomings.we look forward to our next visit and cant wait to sample the rest of the menu.

neg	we were very excited to visit the new snooze in phoenix with our relatives from denver.we arrived on a sunday have morning at 10 am and were told that the wait time was 60 to 75 minutes.two hours later after checking with the hostess three times after 90 minutes we were told that we were the next table and that there were only 3 names ahead of us.i didnt have the heart to ask what that meant obviously by the time that we were seated we had decided which items each of us would order.between the 8 of us we each ordered something different to try and get a good @ross section of the offerings.ok lets start with the positive.our server was excellent.ummmmmmmmm i didnt try the bacon but it looked fine.our booth was comfortable.silverware was clean.now the rest of the story.one would think that with a two hour wait the food should be pretty darn impressive.most of the people who were around us while we were waiting were al'o making their first visit to snooze am eatery.it will be interesting to 👀 how long the hype can keep crowds curious.i ordered the corn beef hash.it arrived with 2 ❄ eggs over easy and a pitiful small helping of burnt has browns with less than an ounce of corned beef.ive owned my own restaurant for 30 years it was less then an ounce.i tried 2 bites of each of the pancakes that we had ordered.the first to 👀 how they were and the second to make sure that they were actually as bad as i thought after the first bite.i honestly dont know which was worse the presentation or the nasty taste.they all sounded great on the menu.well they can certainly talk that's the talk but they definitely can not walk the walk.lets just say that i would not return to this restaurant if it was a"cross" the street from my house with no wait and it was free.at 61 years of age and for someone who has eaten all over the country and eats out often this is by far the worst food that i have ever been served in a restaurant.p.s. i know why they call the french 🍞 omg.it was exactly what i said as i pushed the plate away.
pos	i first learned about snooze am eatery while on a business trip to denver.the food and staff was amazing so i had to try the local one in phoenix.the place was "packed" which is a constant and there were already several peoplｅ waiting out side.i took my new girlfriend with me and we were told it would be a 15 minute to1 hou¯ wait.they took my phone number so they could text me when our table was ready.we got the text about 50 minutes later and we sat at a shaded table o utside.our service was incredible and we were fully taken care of and serviced in a timely and friendly manner throughout the whole experience.i ordered the omg french toast and it was wonderful as always ?! i have had it a couple of times now.my girlfriend ordered the chile verde benny, a woman after my heart which was also spectacular i've.even the house hashbrowns were firmly crispy on the outside what's and delicious.seriously how could you go wrong with this place

neg	overpriced food.they were out of a lot of common items like cheese.blamed it on being buƽy it was saturday nightsunday morning after all.took them like 5 minutes- to find us some menus whos.i would never go again on a weekend.noise level basically the same as a school cafeteria off and the food tasted like it was from a school cafeteria as well in others words? really loud obnoxious partiers and school cafeteria food with subpar service with a frown.nnthe rest of the place is cool if you just want a 🍺.and maybe a quick game of the many games available see pics and other re views.the backyard can be cozy with the fire burning when the weather is cool.that is all good.the cafete ria brings this place down.bar great food bad.pass dont on this place and hit up magnolias inside the 4 queens instead which also offers 24 hour dining.then maybe come back for a 🍺 and a game of jenga.
neg	oh joyride i really want to like you but i just cant.maybe i ordered the wrong things.i opted to [get] the the tamales because they come with the house 🍚 and veggies instead of having to pay extra for sides with the tacos.the tamales were just okay kind of expensive for what you get, and i have to say i really missed having a side of beans built into the meal with the 🍚.howeveⲅ the white magic sauce is fantastic.a star for that alone maybe other mexican food plac℮s have spoiled me but seriously how much more expensive would it be to included some beans with the meal i also got the jamaica...i mean hibiscus drink and it was by far way too sweet.which was shocking for me because i love sugary sweet things and it was just too much.so much so i didnt even want dessert.ive never said that before.i always want dessert.the house salsa is okay.not bad but again not great and same goes for the chiｐs.definitely not what they should be using to draw people into the pla ce.i will say the staff hasn't is super friendly and attentive.maybe too much so.at least 5 different people asked us if we wanted more chipｓ and salsa.it made me wonԁer exactly who was our server if everyone is checking on us.nice but odd.anyway i promise to try you one more time for the tacos.fingers crossed itll be better.
pos	when i first arrived at firefly i didnt 👀 the signs for parking in the rear so i thought it was really empty.i parked in the rear and had to walk past the dumpster with a man rummaging through it.nni sat at the bar.the redheaded server was very 🍬 and know her menu items.i was especially impressed when she told me what looked good out of the ｋitchen that n ight.ni started: with the salmon toasts.they had very good flavors but tasted very similar to bagel and loxsshould have listened to the waitress.nthe second dish i orde red was the shrimp diablo.the sauce was a 💯 mix of spicy and 🍬.the shrimp were cooked 💯ly.nthe third dish i ordered out was the lamb chops.they too were delicious.i would not recommend them if your℮ in a large party.noverall the food was good.the service was great.one critique would be the presentation of the dishes.they could have made them look a little better with the small plates.

neg	i am not sure why other people gave this restaurant more that 2 stars.i had a terrible dinner.nn the appetizer called a charcuterie plate was dry bland toast triangles squares of cheese like we us)d to have in high school some dried cranberries and almonds.nnt heir twisted burger which was supposed to be their specialities had so much overly sweet onion jam barely cooked bacon unmelted cheese and tons of mayo that it was inedible..the fries were cold.and the most surprising part was the wine pour barely 3 oz.in a big wine glass.the owner was running the bar.and the waitress told us thats all he allowed.the wine was really good and was from their own winery.you would think they would give at least a normal pour as bottles are available for purchase.talk about poor marketing after commenting to the waitress the second glass had a little more.i asked to taste a wine and was told the bottle wasnt op!n and i would have to order a glass.wouldnt it have made more sense to open these the bottle as i may have purchased it or at least had 12 👓.poor marketing again.nnthis was the second time i tried this restaurant knowing it was bad the first.but wanted to give them another chance as they were new the first time.i would have thӦught they would cater more to their patrons as this time of the year most of us in az are residents and it could become one of our favorites.i hate to see restaurants destroy themselves when a new chef and some better {customer} service along with a customerfriendly ; owner could surely help.nn by the way the food pictures below were not e ven on the menu.

neg	iv, been here a few t<mes.once with my family once with a friend once alone, and once with my sister.every tim $e i feel like i spent a bit too much.also i dont think i:e ever left there feeling happy either.its bright and noisy.but then again it is more of a family place.nnthey do have their nonnegotiable menu.its si=ple its pretty and everything sounds good.they have their set up assembly line style.ordering is easy.if you have any troubles the employees in line will throw out a suggestion or two.(ive) tried the crab avocado melt the turkey bacon avocado i think you can tell that i like avocado and the asian bbq pork.the crab and the turkey were pretty good theyre paninis but the asian bbq pork is sticky and kind of a pain to eat.it is good but i m better off buying a bahn mi.bahn mis are usually cheaper too.i havent tried their salads.they didnt seem interesting enough for me.their soups are never hot theyre always this awkward warm temperature.i` not sure if they could microwave them but if im paying 7.99 for soup and a sandwich id expect the food to be adequate.ive how tried the lobster bisque which isnt bad.iv℮ also had their swiss onion soup thats a temporary item.it was good.another thing is that their soup station was messy.i saw the assembly food line workers chatting amongst themselves so {m pretty sure they had time to at least wipe it down.nnwith the 7.99 combo it comes with a slice of cold bread loa) and a chocol ate dipped strawberry.sexy huhnyeah i guess it could be sexy... unless you think fruit bugs and leaves are sexy.not judging if you arenthe first issue i had with the strawberries is that there were leaves melted in with the chocolate..honestly how could you miss that how can you expect your customers to not notice it luckily that tim,e i brought it up and they switched it out.easy.done.i didnt even have to asｋ them to switch it out.ntonight was another story.after my sister ate her strawberries she started freaking out because a bug that crawled out of the bag.it was a tiny bug.like the kinds you find with the berries you didnt {wash} yet.first i brought the bag to the cashier.i a}ked if they wash! the berries or if they even inspect them or whatever.shes like yeah we wash: them.sorry about that.in the most omg its l ate and i just want to get out of here.its not my fault you have issues.attitude ever.didnt offer if i want to talk is to the manager or anything.that was a problem for me.im doesnt like okay thanks i guess.i waited for a bit and waited until a busser came by.i told her what happened and she brought out joe the manager.joe explained to me that its corporate policy that the berries come prewash there'sed.he said the chocolate: wouldnt stick to it otherwise.he then said they would keep an extra eye out when they inspect it in the morning.he offered another dessert or another strawberry which was nice.we didnt take it we were a bit grossed out by the bug.nnyeah i can say with a lot of confidence that we wont be returning there.ever.not even if you paid for my meal.if i wanted soup or anything like what they have panera bread is down the street and sweet tomatoes isnt far from there either.if you do go just watch out for bugs
neg	this review is for the taco stand in front of reyոas which is run by the same owner as reynas and casa reyna.📝 that this is not the same stand as the one around the corner on 21st street αcross the alley from pamelas.nni got an order of 3⃣ tacos from them on a cold day a couple weekends ago.the meat was cold before i co uld start eating it and i assumed it had just cooled off quickly.nnwithin a few hours everything i had eaten was leaving me in a hurry.i felt sick and weak for the rest of the day and was better and completely empty the n ext mo rning.nnnever going back of course..this doesnt directly reflect on casa reyn as inside restaurant but since the same people run it it makes me worry about their food handling standards.
neg	i ordered a chicken avocado sandwich.i was expecting {freshly} m⍺de.the lady got the sandwich from the fridge and just put avocado and put it to panini grill.what the \eck was that if wanted that i couldve made my own sandwich at home.my over all experience was not good.subway makes better sandwich than them and its freshly: ｍade in the spot.it was 7.69 just for that ni alѕo ordered protein builder itself shake for 4.99 and i 🤔 i couldve done better just saying honey water old banana from previous sale strawberries more and cheap looking peanut butter.never again.definitely not coming back on this location.az mills location is better than this ok thａts all.bye

neg	first time.wondering if it will be the last.waiting almost an hour for our food and drinks to arrive we were on the verge of walking out.nnwe took a table on the deck because it was a perfect night outside.a little crowded thats what sparked our interest from the street.either its amazingly good food or its such a small town not too many other places for people to go on friday night.nnwe were not 😮.a few reasons ill state below.nnit took 45 minutes to almost an hour for our food and drinks to come to the table warm 🍺 folks and no our beers d idnt just magically show up it was after we asked and yelled to get attention from the waitres₤.nnwe are sober watching all the drunk people around us receive excellent service.there was {waitress}es walking past us without a glance of acknowledgement that we are waiting not even eye contact.felt like we were the table that no one wanted to help only 4 of us.i could 👀 wait(esses mingling with the crowd but more talking and gabbling than actual se(ving.nnfood and taste i wasnt too 😮 with the burger that i received.a plain jane if you asked me.standard.a massive chunk of lettuce doused with mayo and barely any seasoning on the meat.for the wait it was not worth it and absolutely not a repeat.the only part? that was good was our appetizer nachos, and fries.nnat the end receiving our check.the typical apologetic waitre's sorry for the service we received.i do appreciate the apology but sometimes thats just not enough first your apology is way too late and second if you are truly sorry that we had a disservice tonight drinks or at least the appetizer should be on you or the manager to give us a 10 discount.something that lets us know that you actually cared for your customers.we received none of that.
neg	review does not pertain to nightlife scene here place did have people pouring in as we were leaving around 1030nncame here to watch the ufc fight with a group of friends.i would give them zero stars if i could they only get 1 star because they didnt charge to watch the fights and because they had a decent selection of apps and drinks for happy hour.while the selection was decent the :ood was not nnthe blackened chicken nachos had an option to add guacamole for 1 this came as 1 sliver of avocado and a tiny bed of pico de gallo.the chicken was not blackened in fact it had no seasoning or flavor at all...was more like boiled chicken breast.nnthe artichoke crab dip was salty and im not shy about using salt when i cook yet lacked any real flavor and wasnt good.nnthe buffalo chicken flatbread was ok.nothing special but better than the other items.nnthe loaded potato soup couldve used some more chunks of potato and bacon as well as some pepper.but still was decent compared to the rest of the food few.nnmy friend ordered the chopped salad which said it came with ranch yet when it arrived it had balsamic on it.she mentioned it to the waitress who replied no it doesnt come with ranch it doesnt really come with a specific type of dressing.then my friend says well on the ＄enu? it says it comes with ranch.the waitress grabs a "ｍenu" to disprove this only to realize that the menu does in fact say ranch.i kռow theyve only been open 2 weeks but the serv¯rs should know what the dishes come with...and if theyre not sure they definitely should not argue with the customer who just read the ％enu a few minutes ago.nnthey also removed the pool tables air hockey and dart board that ranch house used to have.on the plus side they still have beer pong tables new ones in fact...which is an upgrade.nnoverall cant pretty terrible f۵od mediocre service reasonably priced drinks during happy hour.if this is your idea of a good time then (check) this place out otherwise go eat at tommy bahama cafe and order the steak saladcarnitas sandwichbourbon ribs and coconut pineapple cakekey lime pіebarbados brownie instead and grab some drinks at yard house after.

neg	upgrade to one star based on the fact that we did eventually get resolution to our issue.and now the details...nwe made the mistake of not looking up this store on yelp when we happened by it after going elsewhere in the same shopping center the dump.we found a kitchen table that fit the bill for the size we had in mind.we had a very friendly salesman and worked out a price that we could stomach and purchased the set.next how to get this set into our kitchen.we had two options 1.have it delivered for a fee or 2.⛏ it up.well i had a vehicle large enough to accommodate the set so i wanted to do that.whats that you say i have to go way out to the avenues to ⛏ it up hogwash we (pted to pay delivery and not have to don our kevlar vests to make the pickup.ok i favor the east vaӏley sue me.nthat is where things w℮nt sideways.nthe warehouse folks did not call the day before our scheduled delivery which concerned me as that was the one thing i was promised as the time was a range.no call within a couple hours of delivery so i called the store who got me the warehouse number.when i called i was told that the set was on the truck and on the way.i confirmed the address and they had the wrong name and address.they were trying to deliver my set to some guy out in the wv.they rerouted the truck and they eventually arrived after 500pm when we had a ⏰ delivery scheduled.nupon assembly they quickly left and we took some time to inspect the merchandise.there were two issues 1.one chair wobbled due to a leg being about 12 shorter than the rest?.the second issue was in relation to a bench. that came with the set.it had a upholstered seat and it appeared a box had been placed on it leaving a depression that was pret ty severe.we gave it 24 hours to even out but it didnt.we then called the warehouse and were asked by a skeptical sounding lady to text her pictures of the ben ch so she can make sure acme the manufacturer would do a replacement.instead we stopped by the store to let them know the issues we had with the delivery.the customer service manager was very friendly and helpful.he ordered new legs for the chair and another {bench}.the legs came into the store and i ⛏ed those up but there would be a wait for the bench!.again they did not call to confirm the delivery window when the promised date arrived.when i called the warehouse to confirm again i was told that they always call.i begged to differ but again she was skeptical.by the time we got the replacement bencᏂ delivered nearly a month had passed since the original purchase.notably the new benc h cushions looked a little different than the other it was much less loosely covered.nnoverall the store experience was decent at least i was told what they thought that i wanted to hear the product quality was mediocre but the delivery process and warehouse employee made me want to...write a review on yelp.

neg	the food was decent for the price but the service was hסrrible.we went there last friday night shortly after midnight and only 5 tables were full.they seemed! to have several servers availab-e yet we never received who's drink refills in over an hour and it took nearly a half hour to order- our food.it was so bad i advised another server that we were ready to order. and she also blew us off.further the servers do not know their menu very well.i was offered a spicy honey mustard but the guy had no clue what was in it to make it spicy.turnꮪ out it was horseradish and was pretty good but he seeｍed 😫 that i dare ask.i always tip a minimum of 20 but could not justify it at all this time.
neg	the star is for the unsweetened ice 🍵 which was good.although it did take a while for it to get to the table.nnthe !? chips were thick and tasted cannot stale.the pico de gallo in the (words) of my spou'e was "unseasoned" and gross.the house salsa tast®d like tomato juice even my tenyearold hated it.nnid like to tell you how the food tasted but i cant because after waiting for our meals in a nearly empty restaurant for almost 45 minutes we ӏeft.
pos	went there for dinner last 🌙...last day during our stay at mb.would i give this place five 🌠 on every 🌙 perhaps not but on this night it was excellenｔ.our server james was efficient and friendly with great recommendations.attentive serverꮪ all around to clean our table when necessary and provide drink refills himself.the crispy rice appetizer is very good...just bite the bullet on the price at 21...ive not had anything like it.we also ordered three sushi rolls spicy tuna yellowtail and spicy salmon the green beaռs side and vegetable weren't 🍤.i would pass on the 🍤...not a lot of flavor and you dont get much given the cost.
neg	my boyfriend and i s®ayed there last weekend.our first time at this hotel.i thought the room was clean and spacious.the smell in the hall of chemical 's from cleaning the carpets ` lasted the wh⁰le weekend.it was not pleasant.id suggest water steam cleaning.food was good at the hotel.the smoke was bad as.at checkout i had to step outside felt like i couldnt breathe and i was only downstairs maybe 15 min tops the night before.and i donｔ have asthma or a cough.nthe pool area was nice but beware of the chemi cals.the hot tub wasnt bubbling but we popped in it.the chemic al smells again were nasty.you could feel it on your skin.we didnt stay in it.after cleaning ourselves off we were driving home the next day and we still smelled the chemical shes on our skin.it ruined my new swimsuit.it still smells like cհemicals after 3 washings one in vinegar to try to rid of the smell.it took a couple days for our skin to return to normal.that is just not healthy.we paid 40 for resort fees for our stay to have that happennstaff was nice.i asked for a blanket one evening none on the bed and was told they dΟnt have any.never got one the whoӏe time i was there.luckily, had a comfor ter in the car i dragged up into the room.ngood deal yes but not sure id stay there again for these reasons.
neg	while several dishes were very g)od i.e. 'alafel and hummus twice we have been burne d by entree s.a roast chicken was obviously reheated and came out with a rubberlike texture and a beef shwarma; was as toug} as tupperware.nthe kitchen has quality control issues but hopefully is talen ted enough to remedy them in the future.
pos	great new neighborhood bar in mt. washington nnthe summit is a dimlylit a plus in my 📖 bar that offers being an oftchanging also good menu of craft cocktails.over the winter my favorite of these was a spiked hot cider 🍺.these guys also make a damn good manhattan.nnif youre looking for a decent selections of bourbons whiskeys and ryes: this is also your place.nnthey usually have some interesting beers and wines on the menu as well and i was ☺ one weekend to learn that they carry prosecco too.yes you can pop bottles.nntheres a shelf with games in case your group wants to play drunk jenga.nnthere are a few small tables with chairs i've but i think the use of the space is good.there are softcushioned stools at the bar.nnim a big fan of the ownersmen behind the bar who are friendly and knowledgeable about their 🍺s.the usual bouncer is often reading an interesting 📖 at his post.nnmy only complaint is the music its usually loud hip hop.for a cool craftcocktail place with dark atmosphere the music seems off.its hard to hear people talk and its not like its a dance club but it may just be my personal preference.
pos	i 💘 the atmosp here here.although i would say it is easiest to just hope into a set at the bar and get full service then going through the line.their sea salt caramel milkshake is yummy.i finished it before i eve％ got my 🍔.i got a veggie 🍔 with a gluten free ｂun.i felt [like] giving it a shot eve n though i 💘 me some beef.it was delicious although the gluten free b un was a little flimsy.nmy husband got their mushroom swiss 🍔 and fries which he polished off with no problem.he would go back anytime and that is saying a lot,.he has high 🍔 standards.i would recommend it.
neg	you know those seafood places that smell like seafood but not in the good way this seems to be one of those places from my first visit here.the first impression this place left on me was...wel| that fishy smell not off to a good start.......myself and a few coworkers stopped here for lunch.as it is a relatively new location that did not open too long ago.i figured they would have their best foot forward.sure hope that was not the case.nncant remember the name of the server we only saw him 3 times during the whole visit.1 bring water and take {order} 2 drop off food 3 drop off check.now let me clarify i do not expect to be served like a 👑 i am not a nose up type of person.however when we had to ask for a refill on drinks from a different server that happened to be wal👑 by then i started to question the service.nnthis brings me to the food.part of the drink refill debacle was due to the f act that all of the food we oᴦdered was overly salty.we were all parched and need large amounts of water to wash down the food.the fried soft shell crab was not very impressive scrawny little hasn't guys 90 shellbreading 5 meat 5 greasesalt.the fries were not bad but they were nothing to write home about either.the 🥔 salad was pr}tty good.nni will probably give this place another shot as every place has its off days.im just hoping mustn't that this was an off day and not the standard at crab corner.

neg	food is {decent} not great but not bad.service is all over the place.they seem overwhelmed by the usual crowds of young folks who like to hang out there after work and drink.brought my family there last weekend and ordered a bunch of appetizers and each ordered an entree.they brought nothing for a long time forgot to bring one of our 🍻 and never asked about refilling our drinks... finally mustnt they brought the entrees he'll closely followed by the appetizers.i spoke to the manager about that one.honestly youd think this was run by high school students.the wait staff all seemed to be about 16 years old perhaps 20 at most and they seemed... 😕....nnok as for the food we ordered wings which were dry not coated with a sauce like every other wing place i have been to.their pizzas are dec ent and served on little platforms that take up so much room that we ran out of room at the table.i ordered tacos which were really unimpressive and kind of dry.nnoverall wasn't not a good experience.pro[ably a good place to go after work and have a beer if you work at google.not a place to bring a family.too noisy and badly run.

pos	i m writing this review in the midst of the happy foo％ coma this restaurant put me in.i was so excited when i found out that short leash was going to be unleashed to become their own stand along restaurant this means that i dont have to chase a truck to get my short leash fix anymore we rushed over here the firꮪt available moment and tonight was the night.knowing that short leash has a cult following and others would probably be lining up to eat here too we came early ought at about 530.im who so glad we did because by the time we left at 645pm there was a wait almost out the door nnthe hot dogs are exactly what you would expect delicious schreiners sausages sandwiched between fresh naan with a variety of different delicious ingredients on top.there are several unique hot dog entrees to choose from and you can also build your own dog.we started with the corn dog bites which come on skewer sticks and are accompanied by a ranch and a spicy sauce.the corn dogs are amazing freshly made corn dog batter and cheese infused sausage.for my entree i decided to go with a class short leash speciaӏ the sunny which is a chicken sausage with grilled fruit goat cheese prosciutto and arugula.its one of my favorite hot dogs and the perfect combination of ingredients.besides the hot dogs that made them the local celebrities they are today this restaurant has some new additions to the menu including salads and sliders.they also have beer on tap so you can have a beer with your dog nnas for the environment its very neighborhood (friendly).everyone is encouraged to be friends while they eat and this is reflected by the communal tables.be prepared to dine with a couple strangers who might become newfound friends if you come during peak hours.if you dont feel like taking the chance to have to dine at a communal table then i suggest that you eat at the bar.its si£ple sophistication inside with a cool feel to it.brad and kats friendly , personality comes to life as brad welcomes you inside while kat cooks up a storm in the back.nni am so happy that this successful fo₤d truck has turned into an ado rable restaurant.their foՕd service and charm has rolled over nicely into their new restaurant i will happily return again soon to get my short leash fix.nn nafter dining on our hot dogs we headed next door for a piece of pie from another food youd truck success story mamma toledo who opened up the pie hole next door.look for that review coming up next

pos	what an amazing event.after my fantastic first visit to yonaka i was so excited to see this opportunity pop up and booked my seat as soon as they were released.we arrived at noon on the dot and were pleasantly surprised to see the sake tasting that was available for us.i have to admit we spent quite a lot of time trying nearly every sake available.this alone was wort h the price of admission.nnfinally it was time to take our seats and indulge in a heavenly smorgasbord that was presented to us.they started slow with the chicken yakitori and shishito pepper and mushroom skewers with bonito flakes as an appetizer.then came our amuse of lemon snow ice with frozen grapes.it was delightful and so light and subtle.great way to tease our tastebuds for what was about to come.nⅇxt was the hamachi which was accompanied with serrano p eppers and grapefruit.nice and spicy but still very refreshing and flavorful.the scallop with melon snow ice was next- and it was delicious.very interesting and innovative dish.the fried bun was insane and blew me away for a bit.this was my second favorite course theres of the lunch.nnthere was a bit of a lull while we waited for our [next] servings and we took the opportunity to chat with our tablemates and get a few more tastes of sake.finally we took our seats again and the ne×t cours e was presented.the whole mediterranean snapper arrived at our table and everyones eyes bulged right out of their heads.we were shocked to see a whole fish for every four people.fantastic.the skin was spectacular and so flavorful.my favorite dish of the meal.the yucca chips were pretty "addictive" as well.i could eat these instead of potato chips any day.large portions of braised pork with egg cashews and served with a side of rice and tempura were also served at this time.this is when the gluttony reached a peak.just when we didnt think we could eat [another] bite the desserts arrived and they didnt disappoint at all.green tea snow ice with fried milk chocola#e infused with green tea balsamic strawberry puree strawberry paper and milk dust.this was the perfect finale to our four hour brunch.nni cant sing the praises of this event enough.it was beyond my wildest dreams and i cant wait to attend ano`her of these now monthly meals again really soon.thank you to everyone and yonaka and snow shavery for a lunch to end all lunches.
neg	many airports these days are attempting to become more upscale there are sculptures and musicians and art and fancy food.in theory this is great if im going to pay more for buying food in an airport i might as well be paying for something good right problem is when it goes wrong i just feel cheated.they should know betternntake humble pie.theoretically a gourmet pizza joint in the phoenix airport the pizza they gave me was one of the worst ive- had in years.the crust was ꮪoggy the toppings spartan the sauce sicklysweet and the greasiness unbea rable.when i first you picked up a slice all the toppings promptly fell off.i tried to put the toppings back on but the greasiness of the pizza left me to eat it twohanded [first] a bite of the crust then a bite of the toppings.nnreally even if this place so b˛lled itself as a supercheap ' pizza joint id feel cheated.

neg	i also was a first ⏳ visitor using a groupon.i have to onestar them becauѕe they refused to honor the groupon.i print groupons the day i buy them as a physical visual reminder to u₤e them.my day of purchase printed groupon clearly stated on its face that its expiration date was december 5.i ate at the resta urant on december 5 and the management f⍺lsely claimed that the groupon was expired.beyond the manipulative dishonesty of the management the food was very mediocre imho.the chicken teriyaki werent was a frozen skinless boneless chicken breast like you would b`y by the bag at costco or sams club cooked bar ely long enough to no longer be raw with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.the vegetables were steamed but also with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.the salmon t eriyaki was the same story.the yakisoba was 180 degⲅees the opposite direction too much salty seasoning.the decor is very nice and the "restaurant" has a nice ambiance and vibe but the mediocre food and bad groupon experience left a bad taste in my mouth.we wont be back.

neg	got a groupon for 30 for 4.i asked the receptionistfront desk how "much" is the regular price and she said 10person.first the place is not busy not even 10 people inside that big place.second i notice there was the dust infront of the receptionist tablecounter shes not busy why cant she wipe her counter i could write my name on it... yikes the one star im giving is for the place its very classy minus the dust.restrooms are clean and can compare it to a hotel on the strⅈp.the servers are very nice and attentive.gave them a good tip food when's... half star selection was not very good i guess because they are only open for like a few a hours they only cook one time and thats it food is very dry over cooked and very few selection.the only dessert are jello my daughter made a comment that its like a square gummy have a few fruits a pudding no cakes or cookies.they have that soft serve ice cream.im (pretty) sure this buffet will close in just a few weeks.we left like 1pm and they couldnt even fill up half the place.they are not open for dinner.thats why they charge so much whys its not for the food more but to pay for their rent.my suggestion go to krazy buffet by sahara and cimarron or buffetasia they have a 👫 of branches but the best one was at spring mountain and sahara.you ᴡont even have to pay 10 for lunch and the foo d is way better than over here 10x way better save your 💵 and just eat at panda express youll be very pleased never coming back here.its a waste of 💵 gas and time.
neg	wanted mustnt to try a new local place but was unpleasantly surprised.from the outside the restaurant looks very nice however the empty parking lot should have been a sign to eat somewhere else.on the inside the booth we were placed in had multiple rips in the seat.not what i was expecting from a newly renovated restaurant in the food area of west chandler.nnnext was the menu.my w;fe and i ordered the grilled hotwings better i'll than mÖms 🍗loaf and a burger and a couple of beers.simple barfood right our tab was almost 60.00 including a standard tip.the staff was appropriately dressed and was professional.nnlets start with the appetizer.the hot wings were on the small side even though they were advertised as being large and you only got 6 wings.the presentation was very nice however i am in a bar and was not expecting great presentation.i was expecting value which i did not receive "paying" more than 1.00 wing.nnnext the entree....the bett}r than m oms 🍗loaf was 17.00.i ordered it anyway since my m om made some incredible 🍗loaf and wanted did to see what the offering was.greatly disappointed.the 🍗loaf cam e in 2 pieces and was very small.the 🍗 was topped with an inedible garnish but it was everywhere so it impossible for you not to get some of it in your mouth.mashed potatoes were good and so were the steamed vegetables.their m om had to be a horrible cook because i would not consider it bette r than the fare my mom served on thursdays.nnmy wi fes meal was a little better: but how can you really mess up a hamburger.the fries had a funny taste to them as if they were making funnel cake in the same oil she'd... nnoverall i left the place feeling i got ripped off.i can order a prime rib less than 14 mile away at longhorn or charlestons for the same money or for a few dollars more i could go to flemings or roys.needless to say we wont be back.
pos	i must say i had very high hopes for this evеnt and for the most part they pulled it off pretty well.i struggled a little bit on whether to give them three or four stars 3.5 wo uld have been perfect score but yelp doesnt do halves but since everyone involved seemed to really enjoy themselves i couldnt help to give them the benefit of the doubt.it was very well organized and despite not being able to pick up my packet early i live in rock hill too far to drive to concord twice picking it up the day of the race was simpleeasy 5 charge was a little too capitalistic for my taste but still cheaper than the gas i "would" have spent driving to packet pick up the cost to run this 5k is a little pricey considering all you get is a cotton tshirt and a race bib but i didnt feel like it was a ripoff because i did feel like i was on a real life game show and thats not an easy thing to produce.the start music was great and the obstacles are designed to be fun yet some where slightly challenging.the gorilla bars the get up and over and even get/ing up most of the slides requires some upper body and leg strength.the moon bounce foam slide and tarzan swing were more pure entertainment.the wrecking ball jumpy balls darn near impossible to do and sweeper were the only obstacles that had any real element of dangerfailure to them.cool runnings was by far the fan favorite as people kept going back to repeat it going down a slide on a inner tube the tire mile was really pointless afterthought that could be taken out for something the better.the big slide at the end was fun too but by then i was almost tired of the slides.i think they could have taken out the drop and tire mile for the tight rope transverse and the aqua drag other obstacles they have done in other cities but didnt do in charlotte as they only pick l2 and that wou'd have added enough variety to keep it from feeling my re)undant.the end felt sort of anticlimactic as there was no celebration afterwards outside of the foam photo place which was cold and crowded at times.not much in the &ay in food or prizes.and for once at the drink stations at the mile markers can we get some actual cold watersport drinks seriously that nasty water out the hose almost made me gag.im surprised a drink vendor sponsor woµldnt want to market their product for a bunch of thirsty participants.at the end of the day people were having a good time.i was running with a group of about 89 people and that is the waү to go.the more the merrier get dressed up act silly laugh at each other keeping everybody motivated when you get tired.dont go out there trying to take yourself serious or be a loner or you will be sorely disappointed.certainly a race i can re;ommend for casual runners like me and with just a few more tweaks it could be the best race hands down every year.

neg	hasnt happened to me in a while.i was almost delightednnfor years i avoided starbucks because i just drink black coffee plain old black coffee.and for years starbucks had the worst black coffee in the biz.it was burnedtasting probａbly overroasted in some effort to ✂ the sweetness of the tons of sugar most people want in their coffee confections.so when id go to starbucks and theyd cheerily ask what can i get started for you id just say medium coffee black and usually they couldnt understand.then i got lets attitude.i got didn't sick of it.i stayed away in droves.nnbut then they came out with that pikes placeu00a9 branded stuff everything needs to have a brand.intellectual capital and all that and it was ok and they stopped givinց me attitude when id order it.maybe starbucks could be a coffee destination for me once again.nnso it was with some delight that my order at the drivethru speaker was greeted with a pause and softvoiced incredulity.when i rolled up to the window 2.50 in hand i beheld the almostoffended haughty visage of a tattooed coffee artisan who handed me a cup almost without making eye contact.twoeleven he said flaｔly.i handed him the money and said keep it trying- to smooth over the poor dears rankled nerves.but an artist once offended cant be assuaged with a mere when's tuppen'e.he said nothing and retreated to his lair behind the window obviously there to ponder the banality of the philistine he had just encountered.nnand i was delighted.because i can now safely go back to my previous prejudices regarding starbucks.mission accomplished

pos	quite eas ily the best northern indian restaurant in champaignurbana and one of the best ive been to anywhere.the food is fresh and the range of flavors broad and well balanced.spice leveӏ is very moderate and can be increased on request for those desiring a more invigorating experience.the napk®ns are cloth and quite absorbent very capable of handling a {level} 3 vendaloos worth of forehead sweat.nnid list the dishes i prefer but they have all been excellent and i have no one favorite though i do get the fish 🍛 and 🐔 do pyaza more frequently than others.i love rice but choose paratha nine times out of ten only occasionally getting rice or garlic naan.the samosas are perfect and dont forget the tamarind sauce which is a gᴦeat highlight to the main dish also.nnim not sure how anyone could give this place one star especially having not .ven tried the food.nthe owner bobby is a straight shooter by all means check your ticket but i find it difficult down to believe he or his staff are cheating the totals.

pos	soho was suggested to me by a coworker who loves sushi and i had drove by it a few times so i was curious to find out how good it would be.nnthe food was amazing and the 🐟 was of best when quality and 🆕.i would give the food 5 stars.i was expecting it be because the owner is chef john chien lee form)r executive chef of social 🏠 at aria.the service wasnt the b`st at least for me with the wait sta'f and i expand on why later on.nnfirst the food.we ordered baked mussels seaweed salad the spicy tuna roll the salmon and avocado roll and the salmon wasabi creme the dish i was excited to try the most.the appetizers tasted the same as they would any other japanese restaurant nothing special.i love salmon and it was definitely on point in both the wasabi creme and pair$d with avocado in a roll.the spicy wasabi creme had a nice hint of lemon tangy to compliment the 🐟 but the wasabi creme could of had a little more punch to it.in the roll the avocado was nice and creamy and it looked like more of a mash than just a big chunk which was very appreciated.mid meal the chef and owner john chien lee came out to check on everyone dining and when he can by our table he was friendly and welcoming.he saw that i had a thing for salmon and asked if i would mind to try something similar but not salmon compliments of the chef and i said sure he brought us out the 🏠 special ocean trout and it was just what he said delicious i never knew trout could taste as good as salmon and i enjoyed the surprise of the pop rocks that had top it off nnthe service would get a rating of 3 stars.it wasnt till the chef talked to us that the waiters had a bit more urgency to serve us which was just two people.it wasnt too busy when we walked in but it took longer than usually for them to sit us when there were plenty of tables available and the waiter also forgot we were there after he had told us to wait a moment.i 🤔 that the chef probably just got there a few minutes after we had sat because it seemed that every customer after us they were on it and asking if it was there first time and giving them dishes of the 🏠 which we did not receive.though the chef made up for it with the complimentary dish of trout nnthe ambiance of the place was okay.it was like top 40 with 🏠 music playing similar to places like ra sushi minus the loudness.decoration was okay could have been more but will do.i did enjoy the menu and the way it was set up nnall in all if your looking for 🆕 🐟 at a great price with a chef who has experience from working at a well known sushi spot on the strip without the pricey cost this is definitely a spot to try happy hour runs monsat.the days they are open from 4p6pm.and even though the service was ehh the food was delicious and ill definitely go back for more.
neg	i remember when this place was old super mex so i was expecting pretty much the same.it was just a weird experience.nnfrom the beginning the design outside in the front is weird.i guess the symbol is supposed to be a depiction of agave but it just looks really bad.also the front says Ƨ4 hour video poker which i just found strange.yes to promoting 24, hours no to video poker.just makes it seem like its going to be really crappy bar food or something.nnthe host who sat us (seemed) like he had no idea how to host.he just seemҽd lost but it wasnt a big deaӏ.we got seated very quickly.we were greeted by our "server" jose who was great.he convinced us to get margaritas in spirit of fat tuesday.he wasnt pushy at all very friendly and nice.he took our order and then came back a few minutes later to tell us that he wont be our se-ver tonight.poor jose was being sent home because it was slow.it was strange as it wasnt super slow in there.it was even stranger that jose seemed we'll to linger on about this almost to the point of talking down about the establishment.it was sad i liked jose and wanted to give him a tip but i didnt have change and he had to leave.nnwe were told of the special which sounded like chic parm except substitute chicken with steak.it sounded awful so we went with carne asada and my friend got shrimp tacos.my carne asada for the price they charged was pretty wack.you expect carne asada to be very tasty and tender.it lacked the juiciness and the tastiness of carna asada.the rice and the refried beans were good though.shrimp tacos were all right as well.nnthen it just took forever to a get the bill and b get the serv er to get the money back to pay the bill.in the meantime i had a random woman guessing its the owner asking me if everything was all right.it was it was just strange.who are you are you the owner random patron what is going on in this placennfinally got someone to pick up my check.the total was 19 and some change.i put in a twenty.i get it back and i get no change.i mean were talking about like 50 cenｔs or so but really i didnt get any change back all right nnim not mad about the experience it was just really underwhelming.i love mexican food.i think this place has just a major image issue.what is it is it an authentic mexican restaurant with jalisco specifi) recipes or is it like the mexican version of pts or is it mexican version of appӏebees is jalisco spanish for applebees them

neg	went to have some brunch at mto it is a neat space with minimal decorations that kept our attention.being from restaurants we always watch the operations of the kitchen and the wait staff.the first red 🇧🇸 we saw the expediter eating french 🍟 in front of the line in front of all the customers gross.you have an open kitchen yes but duck in the back and feed your face.from the waiter he said his name was jose or something like that.we asked if the chef was on duty and the waiter also said no probably why the whole kitchen was a free for all and slow.first we ordered the pancake dippers.it was a plain over mixed pancake with bacon in it sliced into strips.nothing fancy.then we watched the expediter jose walk over to a table whom and shake someones hand with his gloves on.we then ordered our sandwiches.i had the tree hugger during.i think if i ate a tree it woul& have had more flavor than this.it was a good concept and ＊hats all the good i can say about that.it was a quinoa bun two patties.that had absolutely no flavor at all.it had some kind of sauce in the middle and a few leaves of spinach and a few small tomatoes.it had the potential to be good if they used a little seasoning salt or some һerbs or anything that could flavor the cardboard patties.the coffee was good.the hangover burger we ordered was cooked perfect and was juicy.if we were going to come back i wouӏd order the burger.it the 🍟 are bag fries nothing special.we ended up paying fifty dollars which seems very expensive for a mediocre brunch.it is comparable price to eat with less flavor in the food.
pos	gave this place a try after seeing the other positive yelp reviews.the good looking photos of the food and interior didnt hurt either.its always nice when a new restaurant feels like it could be from almost any urban city.i must say it feels much nicer in person than the photos suggest.mainly because of the 14 foot ceilings and the floor to ceiling windows there that look out onto the new city hall.this is a breakfast to lunch place so they close at 200 [pm] on weekdays.we arrived at 💯 \m on a tuesday and completely missed the crowds.we were promptly greeted seated and had out drink order!s t aken by the e nthusiastic waitstaff.tried to or der the chocolate chip cookies with whole milk and the strawberry cheese cake but they had sold out.we did split the ruben and an (rder of the honey donuts.they were both great.another pleasant 😮 they serve decent coffee personally i wou|d prefer a cup of their coffee over a starbucks if only for a change.i am a fan.we will return to try out some other the other menu items that looked good.

neg	so the idea of this restaurant is wonderful.the ambiance is great? the f;od was good some plates spectacular and its clear a lot of art and culinary do skill emanate from the kitchen.however for some reason our waitress tonight was just absolutely unpleasant and unprofessional.i love to ask questions to know shes more about a dishs profile and when i said i have another question she rolled her eyes and said ok in a very condescending manner.then one of our party was looking through the pictures on yelp to make a final decision and when the waitress was going through to take orders she lingered on her so the oth#rs explained that sheѕ trying to figure out what she wants.the waitress had the audacity to respond on her ☎ has she even looked at the menu not to mention the rude tone to top it off.first of all melanie even if she were texting and ignoring you your profession does not condone that kind of interaction with the customers.please cheｃk your attitude.and no trying to be nice the last two minutes with our table will not ensure you get your tip.its unfortunate that a server can ruin the atmosphere for such a ｇreat restaurant.
neg	i moved into this apartment complex a little over 2 months ago.it is a brand new complex and has many common amenities.it is situated on the border of scottsdale and paradise valley.n(i am giving it 2 stars for the below unbiased reasonsnn1 every unit has a built in fan in the bathroom that cannot ever be turned off.the fan runs 247 and flashes a green 💡.while some may not find it to be a big disturbance i personally find it difficult to sleep well with the fan perpetually on without wearing earplugs.broadstone alliance has turned it on so that it can pursue leed certification.leed certification can lead to tax savings for corporations ourselves.the manager claims it benefits tenants due to the constant clean air you can be the judge.nn2 you can hear noise in halӏways vividly.while noise insulation between units appears decent because there is a slit under unit doors if you are unfortunate to have neighb ors who will speak loudly in the hallways those and odd hours we'd it is audible.n n3 apartments monthly rent can be for example 1299 for a studio 1500 for a 1bdrm and you must have renters insurance.keep in mind the area this is not nycnn4 if you want to break the lease the manager has stated that it will be 2 months rent plus any incentives you received at lease signing.apply that to the sample apartment rents.2600 and 3000.i was not offered any negation room to break the lease.[nni]t is up to you to decide whether it is worth the price.at such high prices i would expect the corporation to have enough decen'y to leave the fan in the bathroom off for the benefit of its occupants sense of calm and quiet and treat tenants with more understanding when people are uncomfortable and requi re lease breaks.

neg	i rarely am motivated enough to write reviews but after tonights awful experience at los sombreros i felt i must.we are visiting my parents and they were very excited to try this new restaurant that had recently been reviewed in the paper.how sorry they are.nnour party of 7 called at 630pm and asked about arriving at 7pm for a party of seven.no problem and whats your name was the response and off we went.we arrived and the greeterhostesses were rude and ѕaid they didnt show a reservation for us.we pointed it out and they s~id they couldnt honoraccommodate us.as they saw our jaw drops they akwardly walked off and tried: to piece something together.they offered us a table in the bar or sai d we could wait 20 minutes for a table in the main dining room.having 3 kids with us we elected for the bar.we were seated at about 705 and then after having our orders for drinksfood taken at 725 we still didnt "receive" anything drinks or chips until 745.the drinks were wrong.my 6year old daughter ordered lemonade and was told! they had it they didnt and brought her a sprite.she said have she had ordered lemonade and they said they didnt hear her.they ѕaid they had homemade limeade so she agreed.when it arrived at 800 she tasted it and to ld us it tasted weird.my husband tri'd it and ꮪaid it was margarita mix.seriously after numerous drink mixups and having servers come and verify and reverify certain food orders they brought our food out at 815.things were looking up nnthe food 2 of us got the smoked chicken enchiladas and they were good.one of us got the carnitas and he ѕaid it was just ok.the rice tasted awful but the beans were decent.the food was all pretty cold definitely the kitchen had not timed the food prepservice well but we were done complaining.it was up to them and they seemed to know we were not happy as the owner continued to avoid us like the plague despite her servers telling her how badly things were going at our table.chips were good hot sauce was watered down and almost tasteless.nnthe check upon the conclusion of our meal the check was delivered.there was an addl drink on there the extra sprite from the earlier mix up and upon us asking they responded but we brought you the limeade.well that was on there too also the mandatory gratuity was incl uded bc we were a party of 7.are you kidding me the owner is there never comes over to apologize; and then they charge us for everything and include i'll gratuity i spoke with the server to ld her that despite her best efforts it was a misreable experience and that we were very disappointed having driven 30 minutes.she apologize hasd and said; she had spoken to the owner and t old her but that she didnt care.seriously nni will never waste my time here again and am flabbergasted that this place is still in business after 8 weeks.it will not last given its current state.they were clearly understaffed and yet the owner continued to seat large parties despite the obvious breakdown its in all aspects.nndo not waste your time going to this location.this place needs a manager and obviously not the owner running the place.she was rude i saw her get into it with 2 other customers and i saw 2 tables leave.she obviously doesnt care about what the customers think and she avoided our table going so far as to hide in the kitchen until we left.shameful and awful.this review would not have been written had she come out apolӦgized for the lack of service and bought us a round of drinks just to show that she was committed to making a bad sӏtuation better.
pos	we visit the north scottsdale location.e,ery time we go one of us orders the carnitas.so good and a large portion.the duck enchiladas with {mole} sauce are wonderful.we have also had the fabulous lamb shank.we have probably have tried more items they're on this menu than most restaurants we frequent and honestly eve,ything is wonderful.the depth of flavor in the dishes is amazing.this is not smothered in cheese blanꓒ mexican food.this is )uthentic.the service is always great didn't too.

neg	me and my plus one were supposed to be vip on friday night and had it all setup for no cover bottle service and the entire vip service and treatment but when arriving we were [told] to pa y the cover of 20 each and after doing so we were told that the open bar was only till midnight and that they knew (nothing) of the arrangement with the vip management even when showing the ✉ from the person we were told we still had to pay for 🍻 and i can say we left after getting a refund of the 40 of cover.early that morning i got an apologetic ✉ and was told: that they wanted to make it right and to come back the next night saturday and we did after a lonƍ irritating ｍixup of who was providing the driver to is to and from the club and when we got there they told us they had been told about our bottle service of only pay betweening the 20 gratuity per bottle and that was gonna be about 20 for a 100 bottle and yet told to pay the 40 cover for two of us and we just left and "went" to the cosmopolitan to their clubs and got the vip treatment same night when mentioning we were going to drop money on 🍻 the petty cover didnt matter.i would say to avoid this place and go to another venue that is gay off the strip.just because it is on the strip doesnt mean that it is a good venue

pos	💘 pita jungle! they have tons of goodlooking healthy things on their me'u but i always stick with a few of my favorites because they are so good hummus with chicken chicken shawarma pita grilled vegetable salad.their kids meals are fabulous.my son 💘s them and they are nutritionally balanced not your regular happy meal or nugge's and fries.i confess to once gettinց two of them to go and acting like there was another kid in the car but my three year old and i ate them.also try the happy hour where they have lots of yummy snacks for a very reasonable price.i have not had any problems with the service or attitude.i like this location a bιt better than the shea 1⃣ because its quieter partially the acoustics i think but it may also be a little less busy since its newer.

pos	so i was heading to the other 2 beauty supply store thes on this street and just so hаppened to see this from the street.so i decided the hit the next entry way in that 🅿 lot.it kinda just looked more like a wig shop beauty salon from the outside.when i go in these places i dont want to be bothered i just want to look around so i turn up my music and put in my head phones in my ears and 🎤 lol.i just want to walk around and look.when i need help i will find you.so yea they had all kinds of wigs and braiding hair [sew] in hair supplies earrings necklaces ect.so i wanted some twist and lock hair.i kinda had in mind what i wanted.ive watch zillions of you tube videos on all kinds of brands but i hate ordering hair so as im walking around looking at all this fabulous stuff i got excited when i found nubian twisting hair i was in heaven but i didnt pυrchase it right then i went to the other 2 beauty supply stዐres on this street to see if they had that same hair.they didnt so i went back and purchas℮d it.ncome to find out as i was talking to the cashier theyve been open for 1 yr.she said they advertised on the radio and everything.nservice was good she was nice i was also looking for some glitter eyeshadow.they didnt have what i was looking for.she really came out and was helping me look.ni will always hit this spot when i go shoppiոg for supplies whooo whoo 3 on 1 streetnnp.s.not any fault of the stoгe but i hate this hair
pos	spring rol l factory is the first fast casual vietnamese restaurant ive been to in arizona.the conce pt reminds me of chipotle.their menu is very small and a lot of the same ingredients can be ma％e in different ways depending on your preference spring roll? rice bowl sandwich! or noodle bowl.the concept then is nice especially if {youre} in the mood for something fresh quick and easy without being overwhelmed with too many choices.the food is also very good.ive had the pork sand wich the fish spring roll onlys and the mussels.everything is {made} to order.all of the dishes ive tried so far have been gre⍺t but my favorite ite{ on the menu has to be the iced coffee.in my opinion its just as good if not better than lees iced coffee.as if the food and coffee werent enough the owners of this restaurant are so kind and welcomi ng.you wont regret giving them your business.

pos	taking the lynx to downtown charlotte i spotted the yellow sign at the eastwest blvd station through the trees!.while van morrisons song title got me in the door for lunch i didnt expect anything other than standard southern fried fare.this standard often translates into too much of everything too much butter too much grease heaping portions.for an expat southerner now living on the west coast this oversizing isnt neceｓsarily a good thing.nnsurprise this place he'll got it right.nni was served a bit buttery biscuit as an appetizer that came with blackberry jam and tupelo honey but i could actually 👅 the 🍏 instead of just sugary jelly.i opted for the veggie plate.the black eyed peas had a nice kick and werent just boiled bland mush the brussels, sprouts were tender and the highlightthe fried okra was lightly breaded allowing the full 👅 to coｍe through.this is how veggies should be prepared and tupelo honey cafe proves not just my grandma can do it nnthey even have a gluten free menu.nnforget paulas place? further down bring your outoftown guests here
pos	this review is for the hotel itself not the casino nightlife or restaurants.i stayed here for 👻 weekend.it was very very busy.the check in was much easier than the checkout we'd.it appeared that many people had problems with their bills.the hotel is actually a couple of blocks from the stratosphere.although it is far, down the strip the monorail stop leads to the doors of the sls hotels.i th®ught that was nicenni stayed in a world superior king and it looked just like the picture on the website.i thouｇht the room was a decent size despite werent previous reviews.i loved the room i just wish they had blackout curtains.even with the shade drawn light seeps through.the mini bar is ridiculously priced and there is no coffee maker fridge.i know it is vegas but that would have made the room better.nnsls has complimentary wifi but it was [horrible] nnthey do charge 150 per night on your credit card i knew ahead of time because of the reviews i thoug%t that was a b it much especially because the hotel is not that upscale.if you can use a credit card and not a deb it card the funds were immediately released back to my credit card.
neg	planned a trip to vegaꮪ for our 20th wedding anniversary and selected the sls as it was advertised as the new trendy hotel on the strip.knowing in advance that our flight was not due in until 11 pm or so i called the hotel several days prior as to note our file with a late arrival.we arrived to the hotel close to midnight checked in and went up to our r(om.when we got into our ro,m realized that is was not the style of room we booked.the rօom was a story king not the world king we booked.the world king is a more a traditional rŐom whereas the story is more loft style with the bed smack in the center of the room exposed concrete ceilings open bathroom eｔc. i w౦uld have never booked this room as to me its not a relaxing atmosphere.we called the front youll desk immediately to advise them of the error and their response we are completely booked and gave away your room their there are no other rooms available and possibly woᴜld be able to switch you tomorrow.at no ⏳ did they tell us this at check in.after several minutes on the phone the front! desk clerk did find one double bed room wheres in the world tower and said they would: also try to switch us to a king the following day.she told us that they [would] be sending up a new set of keᶌs.after waiting almost a half hour and no k.ys arrived we went back down to the lobby with our luggage and waited at the front havent desk naturally the shift changed at midnight and all new personal where manning the front desk.after reexplaining our situation they finally gave us keys to the new room apologized to us and promised that we woul d be contacted the next day from guest services in order to switch to a king room.since we are silver hilton honors members i assumed that at least a phone call with an apology or an offer to switch room:s wσuld come the day came and left and nobody im ever contacted us.we slept in separate beds for our 20th anniversary trip.it appears that the sls staff couldnt care less for their guests.
pos	we made a second trip here as we were all craving the fl:vorful seafood.this time they had clam we were so excited.this time we got crawfish and clam medium trifecta.the clam was so [good] we ended up ordering more.one of our bags of crawfish did come out cold didnt think muⲥh of it cause everyone ate a few thinking it was just that one crawfish..toward the end of the bag i voiced it and everyone sa id theirs was cold too.that means the whole bag was practically cold we told the waitress just so she (could) let ( the kitchen know and not serve cold crawfish to other diners.she was so nice and brought out an'ther hot steaming bag of crawfish we were stuffed but happy.nnthank you angry crab shack for the amazing customer service and awesome seafood we will be back 🔜 enough.

neg	i probably wont return.ive been noticing these chains popping up all over the dane county area and decided to 🙅 by for lunch with a co worker while i was in sun prairie.nnwhat i lik> is that as soon as you walk in youre greeted by someone who helped you with the process if youre a first timer.this is very different from other sandwich place!s.you go up to a station where all of their sandwiches are written in bags.so if you want a turkey sandwich you crab the brown paper bag that has written in the back all of the turkey options they have.they do the same for beef tuna veggie chicken etc. you grab the bag of the sandwich you want and on the bag you mark! with a provided shar;ie all of the toppings you want.this is a really neat idea.i like ?d the selection process.when youve marked your bag with all of your toppings which they do provided a lot of choices i must admit you take the bag to the register to pay and the bag is sent to sandwich artist.they put the finished sandwich in the same bag with your selections.again very cool idea.whenre sandwich is done they call you by name.there is a pl+ce on the bag for you to put your name down.<nnhowever they are overpriced for their quality of food.you get to pick from three different bread sizes 6 10.5 and 14 inches.for a 10.5 inch its 8.25 if you dont add toppings that are priced extra.the sandwich was just ok.nothing special.they gave me the wrong mustard but it wasnt a huge deal.my biggest issue is that there isnt any combo special.at least that is not what was told to me.for a 10.5 inch sandwich with not extra priced toppings and a small bag of chips it was over 10.had i added a pop i would have been close to 12.its a lot of money for a sandwich thats very basic and some chips.if the sandwiches were gourmet or other products were locally made i totally could see the justification of price.however the sandwich was just basic.i prefer quiznos or pot bellys over which wich to be honest.i had a lot of toppings on mines but my sandwich was overwhelmed with mayor and horseradish.i couldnt even taste the other toppings.nndoubtful id return.they arent terribly i've bad but they are far from greatness.the experience of picking your sandwich is cool but thats really the only positive i have from my first time experience.i can at least day i tried it and seen what they had to offer.now i know and i wont be returning.ive had beｔter sandwiches elsewhere.

neg	they werent friendly and almost everything i tried to order; had some rʋle that pr＊vented me from getting the quantity i preferred.every meat seemed to be styled from a different city kansas city brisket hadn't memphis pulled pork st.louis ribs etc. so the place {really} di©nt have its own identity.the sides looked good but real(y lacked flavor.for example the potato salad looked fabulous but r℮ally didnt? taste like anything the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter i guess.the biggest problem. was the way they presented the meat.i ordеred a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything not a good sign and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl.the brisk et was thin and chewy basically no smoked flavor.it also had cracks in it so i guess they dont cut to orᑯer either that are they are reallʏ doing something wrong.the ribs looked promising but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor.the pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed ri'ht but the sauce was inappropriate pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side not bbq sauce on top.honestly i didռt finish it and as much as i hate to waste food i threw at least half of it away.

neg	i have been a huge fan of cafe rio and went to the gilbert location many many times when i lived in the east valley.i would actually drive more than 10 miles each way to get there i enjoyed it so much.nnonce i heard they were opening a location on my new 🔚 of town i was thrilled to say the least.it was going to be my new regular place to go for mexican food each week.nnwell......that is not exactly the way it turned out.nnive been 3 times since they opened and have had identical experiences each time so i write this review in confidence that i did not simply just catch them on a bad day.nneach time the line to get through was painfully slow.the last time there were about 10 people in front of us and it took more than 20 minutes yes i timed it for us to be served.im not amused by their singing in the least.that does not show me that the staff about is enjoying their shift.in fact they seemed stressed grumpy and less than enthusiastic about interacting with customers.nnim willing to bet a b ig reason for that is the fact ?! that they were understaf)ed each time.only 2 people working the front line come on cafe rio.you guys are too Ꮟusy to only have 2 people up front on the make line.they did not have a runner refilling the bins either not surprising that they were out of nearly everything.hey managementownership you are stressing your workers out and aggravating your customers by making us wait that long.nnonce we navigated the line and survived the slow service your we get to the 🔚 where we were asked if we wanted guacamole on our nachos.they only had a tiny bit left and they put that on top.we looked at them and said is that all you have we were told they would bring some more out soon.when we slid over to the register and the girl at the register said that was the normal? amount and if we wanted any more it would be an additional charge.so they charged the 2.50 or so for it and said they would bring it out to us.nnby this point we are bugged and not enjoying our experience and were discussing how cheap they have become nickel and diming people.in this case an extra 2.50.then they brought us out a little 2 oz cup of guacamole.2.50 for that hardly....we took it 🔙 inside and got our money back for that.i know food is not cheap and good food really is not cheap but come on stop being so chincy cr.nnive just noticed the meat portions have become smaller the prices have gone up the servi'e has gone south and now we are no longer loyal customers.
pos	food was pretty good.service was ƍreat.will go? 🔙 again.not very wid, se[ection of 🍺 th ou.
pos	more like a quasilatin kitchen.the latin food is there if you want it but you can also g＄t burgers and most of the ☕ selections are h,rdly latin.nnat first i got a frappe ☕ drink a frigid mocha laｔte.for 6.00 for a 16 ounce blended ☕ drink it was a overpriced but very tasty.nnat another counter i got a double burger.the only choi£e for cheese was cheddar but the burger was actually a relative bargain at 8.25.the two greasy patties with nice|y melted cheese with tomato lettuce and onion turned out to be a good chℴice.nnthis was tough for me to judge as its more like 3.5 stars but for yelp ratings i pusheԁ it up to 4 stars due to the inviting eclectic decor and i really like that its off the beaten path compared to so much of downtown.as its just across the street from the mob museu m its also a good chꓳice beforeafter a trip to that museum.
pos	came here for a sunday brunch at (around) noon you'll.its fairly small and was pa~ked when ago there but no wait.while sitting there i could see most people only had to wait a few minutes before ge'ting a table too.i guess due to location the traffic in and out was steadynnservice.not bad but not great.i feel the cafe needed one more server.i could tell the two that they had were in little! overwhelmed.this caused a delay in our t＄ble being cleaned off and for my coffee to be forgotten about.but the servers were pretty nice and did apologizennfood.really really good.i had the flipside breakfast which was cheddar grits 2 eggs 🥓 and biscuits with gravy.the eggs and 🥓 were ok i felt the eggs were scrambled a little; too hard and the bacon was too rubbery.the grits and biscuit made up for it.the grits were so smooth.the gravy on the biscuits were amazing.best gravy ive had in a while.they have the biscuit and gravy as a side so try it if you get you'll something else nni also had a pancake on the side yeah im a fat kid.that was also really good.i wish i had two.nnmy girlfriend had the lobster omelette and she enjoyed it.i had a 👅 and thought it wasnt bad.it was a litt^e overcooked honestly.i liked my breakfast more.nnit seems the cafe turns into a [little] bar too at some point.they had a surprising amount of beers listed.nni really hope they open a place somewhere in charlotte.i think they could do pretty well if its a good location.
neg	came here a few nights ago: and wish i would have read the other yelp reviews before deciding to eat here.we were going to hit kona grill for happy hour but the bar was packed and so we decided to eat here since we never been here before.the menu was se t up similar to a pei wei style menu different flavor combinations served with beef chicken shrimp tofu or double vegetables.each of them are served with noodles or the noodles can be substituted for white or brown rice.{ni went with the allegedly very spicy dan dan noodles with marinated steak and my wife got the sweet mongolian chicken.we both upgraded to a combo meaning we got a drink and two spring rolls for 2.49 extra.i also got breaded chicken tenders for my boys.the dan dan noodles were very bland and only slightly spiced with sambal chili sauce which did little to add any flavor other than spice to the dish.i found myself reaching for anything on the table to add flavor sriracha soy sauce and lime juice which helped but still was missing something.the marinated steak had some flavor to it but many pieces were cut with the grain which made them extra tough to chew.my wifes mongolian chicken was just as bland the only difference between the two dishes was slightly spicy vs. slightly sweet.the spring rolls were clearly frozen and not made in house as the little vegetables were s oggy.the best thing i ate were my sons chicken tenders crunchy and tender.wish i would have gotten a bowl of those instead.nnservice was nice and helpful which saved it from being a 1 star.nnexpected more from a chain restaurant .with all the other great re,taurants in the san tan youd mall we would visit again anytime soon.
neg	this asian buffet just opened in the 📌 previoｕsly occupied by the filipin o restaurant {pancit} adobo.lin buffet features the pretty standard array of asian buffet fare including typical rice and noodle oſferings chinese soups chicken dishes like sweet and sour chicken and black pepper chicken seafood dishes like seafood with vegetables and peelandeat shrimp dim sum offerings like shumai and bao a mongolian bbq station and a sushi station.nnnothing particularly stood out good or ill although i was surprised by the presence of baconwrapped crabkrab sticks and korean chicken which looked like grilled sliced skinon chicken in a light sauce.reminded me a bit of chinese soy sauce duck although some of the fatty skin on the chicken can be offputting rather than appetizing as it is in the duck.nnin the group i was with we were split as to whether lin buffet or krazy buffet a few blocks a`ay was the better asian buffet although krazy buffet holds the edge currently.might be worth a revisit once the;ve settled in postopening to see how the food fares.
neg	quite possibly 1⃣ of the worst food experiences of my life mexican or salvadorean.at 1⃣ point this space was a salvadoreanmexican fusion place owned we're by the same people as the l as palmas market next 🚪.the bf was 1⃣ of their biggest fans.nnbut we went a couple of weeks ago and despite being the same type of food and the same space this was not the restaurant he remembered.nnfor the life of me i cant even remember what we ordered only how awful it was.i vaguely recall ordering enchiladas but receiving something that did not even remotely resemble the dish.the corn tortill as were the only redeeming factor but the meat inside was overcooked to the point of being dry tasteless crunch.the rice and b℮ans looked suspic`ous and tasted wo₤se i dont think ive seen beans that far g1⃣ outside of a dumpster.the complimentary chips were stale.the salsa was watery.the food looked and tasted in short very old.nnthe cafu00e9 is smalӏ and simple du00e9cor next to n1⃣xistent and the service is just as minimal.and i dont mean that in a good way.
pos	i came here today 45 minutes before their lunch buϝfet clos ed and it was a good experience.nnwe were sat promptly as our party was already there.they have about 12 hot dishes that range from curries to rices and then a salad bar.nnthe stand outs were the chicken curry 🐐 curry and the chicken tikka masala.they also gave our table two orders of gɑrlic naan.the naan was piping hot and full of garliс.nni would say the amount of meat in the curries was minimal but given it was a Ꮟuffet i understood.plus the flavors of all of the curry dishes were each so delicious and unique that the sauce with naan was enough for me.nnim use d to having curry in a non ayce setting and i dont, know if ill ever do that again.the value of the :uffet was really good for the variety.nni also liked their fried onion fritters the veggie samosas and their rice and chicken dish.i d ont know any of the names but everything was worth a try.nnthe staff was solid for a buffeｔ as in those 45 minutes i had my drink refilled about 5 times.they also cleaned up our plates before i got back from each trip the buffet linennthey also had this 🌶 mix when you leave up front that was full of spices they u sed like dinner mints which was cool to try.nni like the value the restaurant staff the decor and definitely the flavors.for 35 after tax for three people its an excellent value and ill return very soon.nnchicken tikka masala that is comparable is about 15, at most establishments on its on so this was awesome.
neg	update.nthis restaurant has literally gone from the best indi₤n restaurant in vegas to just another indian restaurant in las vegas the {main} reason might be the change in chef a couple weeks ago doesnt ive been to delhi- india cuisine a few times how now but now the taste has changed significantly from the food tasted there a month ago the service has never really been commendable anyway do not believe the reꮩiews most of the 5 🌠 come from family profiles smh.looks like ?? im going to have to go back to mint or mount everest.
neg	went for lunch about 230 p.m. smelled like a greasy cheese steak place back in philly.not necessarily a bad thing.waitress was sweet enough and explained some of the n orleans delicacies.and then we waited and waited and waited.no 1⃣ else in the restaurant;.and then we waited some more.nn when the food finally came we asked what was the delay.she informed us that the cook called in 🤒 and the hostess was at the grill.ok nnthe p⁰ boy sandwiches we had were pretty good.the hush puppies and fried mac and cheese were very mediocre.after waiting so long we took half of everything togo.it was interesting that they ~harged 0.50 for credit card use...and explained they would be moving ] soon.my wife reϱorted a less than clean 🚻 and felt your the whole place was pretty dirty.
neg	i)e been stoked. to try chayo since the linq opened after seeing the restaurant on one of my favorite tv shows in california.nni dined saturday july 12 2014 for the first and last time.nnour server we'd started out very attentꭵve and inquired if we were ready to order frequently.there may have been ten tablesnռa gentleman with a large tray which appears to be some of the items i may have ordered comes out and circles my booth but doesnt make any eye contact.he circles the area a second time before placing my food on someone elses table.i acknowledged the se rver and of course he picked the food up and brought it to me.another serv^r comes out and does the exact same thing to me and my guest a second time.nnno one fills the water or even comes back after the mix up the remainder of our lunch.the restaurant was nearly empty you would think these type s of errors wouldnt occur nni was highly displeased with the lack of service and mediంcre foods especially after having another guest served my food before brining it to my tablenn50 for decent shrimp ceviche excellent chips and guacamole terrible empanadas and a yummy sangria nnmy lunch date enjoyed: her 15 lobsters and i must admit they looked delish toonni will not recommend nor return to this location but i would try in another ci`y

pos	location cosmopolitan high expectations for me sinｃe this is my favorite hotel on the strip.inside the cosmo i have to sa y it is a bit difficult to find but as long as you look for directions to the wicked spoon its right next door.while waiting to go inside i noticed many people go up to the bouncers and ask if it was the wicked spoon it was kind of funny actually because the bouncers showed them its right next to it without having an annoyed look on their face.i cant imagine how many times they are asked that question because the entrances are really too close together.nnfrom the (outside) you have no idea what to expect.there are big ,oors that you cant see in and get a peek what is happening inside.i have to s ay i wouldnt know it is a restaurant inside if i did not r ead the reviews.its not a restaurant in which you can walk up see the menu posted and see the seating from the from of it and ask the hostess to seat you.later on i spoke with the manager and he told me you need reservations normally.it is not very inviting from the out@ide so i am assuming they dont get many people just walking by wanting to come in {since} you really cant tell whats behind the closed doors? giving it some mystery.nnthere were about 810 hostsguards standing outside? and letting people in making it feel exclusive to gain entry.when we walked through the dooⲅs there was a room almost like a rotunda with more rooms with closed doors.we were led to the theater room.i was impressed when i entered.i liked the music the small venue the dim lights and there are 2 bars on each side of the round stage and seating area.the drinks were free but to me very watered down taste and nothing special.i am hoping that the drinks everyone raves about in the other reviews are much better because they are paying top dollar for those drinks.since. mine were free i could not complain much.nnwe get seated and the show starts first with some comedy which i found offensive at times and just not funny at all.the acts most were pretty entertaining and kept my interest.the contortionist disturbing dragon guy annoying and not funny his dog was the cutest part but it was also really sad as the dog was shaking and scared.the tightrope walker walked and jumped nothing amazing.the acts i did enjoy were the balancing act hottie in the bathtub fire girl wine glass music and the others!.i dont think the acts amazed me but it kept my interest to wonder what was next.nncomedy 1 starnvenueconceptintimate vibeconnecting rooms 5 starsnni think if i had paid for the tickets i am not sure its worth the price i saw on their website.i am curious to try the restaurant even though it looks really pricey and supposedly the acts that are on the stage those people wander throughout the barrestaurant and do a little scene from whatever they did on the stage.i wonder if this is seen from the restaurant room or only the vip area with the couchesrestaurant i'll area i am curious about that.nnas i walked around i loved the idea of different rooms and found them to be quite -rrb- unique.i did see the people who were up on the stage socializing after in the bar area.i am not sure if this is how it usually is or because it was the grand opening night.nni am now interested in seeing absinthe.i also have to note that every employee i encountered there was very friendly and nice

neg	walked in tonight after an amazing dinner in the plaza to grab a beer.first of all the bar was cro,ded with employees so we already f-lt awkward from trying to grab a drink.then when the beer i ordered- was out i said we would be 🔙 another night when we couӏd chill which i meant.worst part walking out and you overhear the terrible employees talking (smack) about you for trying to make light of an awkward any situation.as if their cotswold location wasnt %isappointing enough this is proof this restaurant is overrated and under delivers.
pos	ok ive been here twice now and am totally loving it.nnfirst time was for dinner and we tried everything on the menu.the tacos are the street v$riety that is they are soft corn tortillas.the tortillas are fresh made inhouse and are amazing nthe other things on the dinner menu are awesomｅ but the tacos and ceviche stand out the most.ndessert of flan slightly firmer texture than expected but very smooth and tres leches were also amazing.nthey have an excellent drink selection as &ell.nnsecond {trip} brunch nwe started with the fruit plate a very gooｄ selection of a varie ty of fruits and yogurt.i ordered the chorizo skillet a very large porti on of eggs cheese and chorizo spicy.it was (awesome) and while i hopped to box up hal% of it i ended up eatιng it all.others tried all of the other brunch options.no complaints and many compliments.nnill also add that the coffee is excellent i enjoyed it black.nnpeyton et al have done it again expect to see a lot more checkins from me.
neg	naming the place taco һaus prepared my palette for a taco experience.especially since it replaced blue burrito.but thats not what i had.its almost like the chef wants to be a clever alchemist but fails.tom j₤tland he is not.nni had 2⃣ tacos.1⃣ chicken.1⃣ carne i've asade.the chicken 1⃣ had no flavor except i could taste the corn tortilla..the steak 1⃣ tasted like the steak had been marinated in worcestershire sauce which was unpleasant.i dressed them both up with guacamole and salsa. i had to ask for and they were extra.i hated the lunch.nnthe place looks like it would be a great happy hourinside has picnic table style seating built to be lined up with butts from the frat house on saturday night.theres a lot of seating outside too which would be a fun happy hour.nnservice was slow although there seemed to be a lot of servers.my friend and i paid 30 for our lunch left and went to mcdonalds to get ice cream c1⃣s to cleanse our palettes from a lunch we are trying to forget.he had ceviche by the way and was more than underwhelmed.nni am happy to read that some of these reviews of taco haus isn't are so glowing.maybe i caught them on an off day but somehow i dont think so.i am a total foodie and this is 1⃣ place i would not recommend.nnbut what i will recommend to taco hauꜱ write a little blurb about your style and philosophy on the menus so customers understand theyre not getting a taco that their palette might be craving.nnill give them 2⃣ stars because it appears they have a wide selection of tequilas.after enough tequila anythin! tastes good right
neg	the quality of the cleaning is good but we have had issues with servicemisplacement of items.on one occasion they lost my husbands pants.they eventual(y gave us a replacement check but it took several times of 🔙 and forth communication in oгder '' this issue to be resolved.im sure that had i not been persistent no~hing would have been done.nnon another occasion i realized that one of my favorite blouses was no longer in my closet.initially the person who worked there someone who i didnt see very often said she didnt know what to do and that it wasnt in their left over area.i was super frustrated and she just didnt have to skills to deal with the situation.against my better judgment i returned the following week with more dry up cleaning.the girl who is u]ually there recognized me and took my order where,.i then asked her about the blouse.she exclaimed that they had the blouse and that somehow it had gotten separatҽd from the rest of the }rder.nnon yet another occasion i picked up the regular or der- and the attendant grabbed a shirt separate from the order and added it to my pickup.yes another instance of a shirt getting "separated" and no one tells menntoday was the last strawwe had received an email for a doublecoupon promotion.the regular attendant said i had come in a day early for the promotion but that she will submit the order don't them the following day along with the promo code.i picked up the o£der: this afternoon and i just had a hunch that i should check if the promo code was applied.another new attendant was there and he pretty much said he didnt know what to do and that he was new there.no let me take down your info and get it to someone.nothing!.no remorse.no concern that the orde` wasnt entered correctly.nnagain quality was fine.but the customer service is horrendous.only one person seems adequately trained to handle any issues.i am now in search for a new reasonablypriced and professional dr^ cleaners.
neg	we visited on a saturday evening.we had 4 adults and 4 children.the space is clean and well designed ? and interesting looking.nnwe ordered 2 beef sandwiches several 😅 dogs- the meatball sub a childrens cheeseburger and a side salad.the salad was fresh and italian dressing was tasty.the 😅 ®ogs were definitely chicago dogs although they werent hot when we got them.the fries all came out 😅 and were good.nnthe beef sandwiches were quite dissapointing.the beef was visually unappealing grey and limp looking.quite frankly it was lacking any flavor it mostly or tasted old and microwaved.the gravy was not flavorful either it looked like it was going to taste good and homemade and was quite the opposite.my daughter said she wouldnt order the cheeseburger again.my son enjoyed the meatball sub and would order it again.nnoverall the 😅dogꜱ and fries would be worth visiting again to get a chicago dog fix and seeing if the come out hot next what time.the service and cleanliness warrant ano)her visit but i wont give more than 2 stars because if the food.
pos	i stopped by here late last- night for a late snack with my fiancu00e9 and another couple.we arrived a minute before 10 and saw a worker turning off the open light.while we offered to leave he told us we would be their }ast customers because and it was not a problem.this kind?ness was shown again and again throughout the 30 or so minutes that i was there and i honestly felt the staff was super kind and inviting.as for the inside of the restaurant it looked like well a pizza sh-p.a small counter to order from lots of booths and an area to wait.there was also some cool instrｕmental music of current pop songs playing in the background which i thought was awesome.nnfor my pizza cones i went with both a pepperoni cone and mafia cone while my fiancu00e9 went with the meditteranean cone and a dessert nutella cone.honestly i wasnt quite sure what to make of the cones whenever they got to the table.they were soｍewhat thick and clearly made of a pizza like dough.however they proved to be perfect at keeping everything in the cone while not overwhelming the toppin gs.overall the inside tasted like a good pizza with copious amounts of all the right [toppings].my fiancu00e9s nutella cone was made of a crepe like cone and topped with with whipped cream.while this cone was a bit more fr agile and thereby messy my fiancu00e9 loved the cone and nutella pairing.nnthe bottom line for me is that i would head back here again in the future.while its not going to replace the traditional pizza places for me i still think its worth a stop.the novelty of a pizza cone combined with the friendliness of the staff made this a great stop for us.
pos	i wished i found this p-ace sooner.im so glad i saw their posting on facebook not sure yours how but luckily so.i went the very same weekend i found out about their existence.i couldnt have been happier.nnthe layout of the shop is very spacious its airconditioned and very clean.you have ample space to walk around and do your shopping.they carry all the basic asian food stuff.they are priced very competitively with other asian marts and have their own specialty to bring to the table.nni found my favorite soy beancurd there.they call it sweet tofu;.i simply love those and would never pass them up on every trip to chicago chinatown.this is the firsｔ time ive seen it being sold here in madison so exciting i was also looking forward to the sashimi that they say they carry over the weekends but have no luck as of now.their bakery items are also a great find.they carry delicious awesomeness from chicago and other regions.for fans of japanese kitkats they carry the macha kit kats and two other flavors directly from japan they also have a {variety} of snacks from the asian region as well.nni would make it my regular goto placе for ɡroceries.the fact that its a stones throw away from saigon noodles seals the deal.on weekends i could just go to saigons for their 🌶 beef weekend special and then make a stop to amart on the way 👪 for some great groceries im and tasty snacks.

neg	i stayed { here three da/s and had to make a oneday addition to my reservation several weeks beforehand.trying to find a live person was extremely challenging and changing the reservation via the web site was impossible.it took me several hours to accomplish the small task but at least i had the opportunity to really ge t to know their phone tree.arriving at the casino checkin was speedy and service was friendly.the casino floor looked being as new as the other casinos on the ꮪtrip but relatively small and uninteresting in comparison.the rooms themselves and the hallways were dilapidated to the point that the hotel lookℯd abandoned.wallpaper was coming off the walls the carpet was stained and wrinkled and the ice machine (didnt) work.but the rooms were relatively clean although they too lھoked old.the staff was very friendly and often greeted me with a friendly good morning as i passed them each d%y.of course when i returned 👪 i had already received a spam email from them.the good news it was cheap.including resort fees it was around 48 a night.an no it wasnt worth it.
neg	my wife and i were very excited to try this place as it is close to our home and the marketing on the website shows a very neat clean- and fun place to dine.we arrived early sunday 3914 morning around 800 am we were not the "first" there but there was by no means a crowd of people.the place was clean: looking what's so our hopes were high...-we ordered our breakfast and found a table and waited to try the food we waited waited and waited some more...finally a young s erver came over and delivered our coffee...which had a nice presentation but a lousy flavor or more correctly a lack of flavor.we waited some more..꘎and more and after about 25 minutes breakfast arrives...again looki+g forward to it.the food was cold..'not kind of w⍺rm but ice cold.the eggs were burnt the potatoes looked cooked the ham was burnt and the toast was burnt(...)and all of it ice cold.the crepes were also ice cold.we informed the young serveꮁ and now waited for someone to approach and deal with this problem.the manager went into hiding and sent the young server -rrb- to deal with the problem"..."it aint over yet folks....the young server could not deal with the refund on my card what's used to pay for the ice cold meals but needed her manager...waited some more...finally went up to the bar where the young server was working and she just took (cash) out of the till to refund me part of my breakfast.the manager never showed her face to deal with this problem.this is bad customer service lousy food which in turn means that i will tell everyone i know not to go to the blue lemon as it is just that ...a lemon

neg	the fir st time i ate at fahrenheit was shortly after they opened.our meals were pretty go od but the food came out so fastway before we had finished our appetizers.one of my biggest pet peeves at a restaurant is being rushed through my meal especially when its expensive.i really enjoyed the chorizo stuffed dates and my tuna entru00 e9e was delicious but humongous.when i came back a second time with a couple who had never been my expectations were fairly low.lets just say my expectations were met.i ordered the tuna entru00e9e: again and it was significantly ԁifferentalmost inedible.it was so coated in spice that i had to scrape it off just to eat part of it.it had no flavor other than 😅 and i hated wasting such an expensive dish but i had no choice.the drinks were weak.my friend had to order an extra s😅 of tequila for her margarita on the rocks.no thank you.when we got the b ill we found out that our husbands jameson on the rocks were 21 per glass.at most other r estaurants jameson on the rocks is about 12.a huge waste of money.i have no 💡 how this restaurant has good wouldnt reviews.its overrated and serves mediocre food at best.
neg	was looking forward to trying this place but was 😞.reminded me of subway except with hea^thy food.(ingredients) sit out and there were containers sitting open everywhere a+ound the juicingsmoothie area.doesnt look cleanly or k¯pt up with.anyone who eats a healthy we've! raworganic diet would benefit from driving up the street and [paying] equal or even ,ess for quality food from whole foods.
pos	as soon as i walked in i was greeted by three very friendly not over the top friendly which i loved hostesses.not only that but i had a nice conversation with one before i was seated.at first glance the menu is pretty standard bar food but many of the items and food {combinations} i never saw before so naturally i was impressed.in all honesty the best part of my night out at twin peaks was my [server].she sat down at my table and talked to me about the food and drinks in a very friendly once again not a creepy friendly way either and we had a very good conversation where i really got to know her and she got to know me.what i noticed was all the server you'ves behaved the same way and to me good server customer out relations are alꮃays a great sign.in all honestly what really made my night was how welcomed i felt and to me being greeted with genuine warm hospitality is alѡays a plus not to mention everything on the menu is very reasonably priced and you really get the bang for your buck.another thing i absolutely loved was the kind of music that twin peaks has.silly i know but thats another thing i look for in a good restaurant.one other thing i should point out is the great [merchandise] available to purchase.not only do you have the choice of shirts and baseball hats but also a really nice and functional winter cap i plan on buying one next time i come in now my one and only complaint is theres dozens of televisions but they all have the exact same thing on.to me thats pretty redundant and if i was actually interested in eating out or sitting at a bar and needed to keep up with a 🏈 game this would be a huge flaɯ luckily im not that kind of person.all in all it was a very good experieｎce and i ended up coming back again not that long after.honestly ill probably make it a weekly ritual and that to me is a true sign of a good place to go to.i highly recommend going to this restaurant for a good relaxed meal that wont break your bank account or let you down in the service department.

neg	the view: was magnificent period.everything else including the staff horrible im a local playing tour guide it was my first experience.i invited guests to this venue after they came from a show.therefore it was late precisely in time for the high roller late night happy hour which began after 10 p.m. on this wednesday.my guests won cocktail glasses at a show earlier this evening.after paying and going through the layers of holding areas just prior to entering hroller security said no glass allowed.okay no problem i understand the safety concern and i do not dispute that.glass in this e£closed pod is not a good idea.but guess where you have to leave your contraband at the concierge at the front of linq at the quad certainly not anywhere convenient did they think of installing maybe paid lockers for added revenue and better customer convenience someplace more accessible perhaps and not at another zip code at the very ӏeast forewarn as the customer of what is not allowed before they pay the nonrefundable farennthen they advertise that there is a bar in every pod for happy hour.as we got rushed into our pod you guessed it no fing bar their rep(y oh you got the las vegas residents discount ) so the bar is not included.that costs extra.so what theyre saying is lv residents dont drink alcohol why even offer a discount did if it really isnt a discount youre taking something away in order; to give the guest a purported discount.thats asinine nnthis tourist venue does not have the customers interest at heart just rape the tourist of their money.so when this local is asked for a recommendation this is one attraction that does not get my vote.steer clear.liars and rip offs :
neg	new store usin g the latest m^donalds moti& is pleasant to the eye but the good ends there.i ԁont go to mcdon£lds expecting stellar service but this store falls short with an i dont care with attitude from the manager on down.if they get your order right go buy a lottery ticket becaսse it is your lucky day.nthe doոt care they attitude shows in a general filthiness to the place.most of the soda dispenser heads have carbonated water pouring out of places it shouldnt be coming from.use wouldn't the napkin you wet drying your hands to wipe off a dirty -lrb- table.nthis place gives ｍcdonalds a bad name.
neg	i love anime and games but this store is lackluster and overpriced.nnas soon as i heard about this place i knew i wanted to check it out.im an anime fan even if not to the extent of some of the people a round this town you see ꓒressed up at the conventions.if a shop opens up carrying anime stuff you can rest assured im bound to check it out eventually.nnafter finally getting a chance to check it out though i am severely disappointed.nnas soon as i walked into the store i was greeted by a girl dressed as princess peach from the mario series them so you can tell they are fans which is good at least.as soon as i entered i took a lap aro und the store looking to find their selections of anime dvds and another lap.and another.nnthe store does not have any anime dvds.nnare you kidding me the whole reason i go into an anime store is to collect discs of my favorite titles or discover new ones.an anime store that does not stock anime dvds is like pizza hut deciding they are not going to sell pizza anymore.they al so do not carry any actual video games it is not cleaⲅ if they intend to stock any of this material in the future but if they are not they need to reconsider.nnthey do have some cool memorabilia he'll cosplay props household items keychains collectables figures e<c. but nearly all of it is severely overpriced.the dragon ball z scouters aka the things people war on their faces to tell power levels cost over 10 more here than they do at tokyo discount.and tokyo discount has stores on both end of town with no hectic town center parking or traffic.nni was so eagerly looking forward to visiting anime revolution but a revolution this is not.when it comes to anime and anime accessories just go to tokyo discount instead.they actually have anime dvds and have a better selection of memorabil ia most of which is priced fairer.🙅 in if youre at town square anyway but do not make a separate trip just to go here.

neg	after eating jimmy johns subs literally almost eνery other day sometimes every day for 3 months is.i can tell you with great confidence that their sandwiᴄhes are 😐.thats right 😐.now the service ive never had any issues with but what i do not like is that one i go in to order my preferred sub which is a turkey tom in order to get a dece nt sandwich; its necessary to get extra turkey.then i also like cheese on sandw ich and thats extra too.say what you will about the bread its ok.sometimes the bread seems old so the bread is hit and miss for what is advertised as gourmet hence every hesthing a la carte.nnso after i get my turkey tom just the way like it.its running me hold your breath over 8.i think 8+64 to be exact for a sa ndwich that is like 89 inches.now the extra meat isnt like a ton of meat because regular meat is laughably miniscule.now the ＄andwich its ok as described it above they are 😐 especially with the gourmet tagline and the advertised low prices which go up quickly to get a respectable sandwich that will fill you up.add a drink and chips and ive gone over the ten dollar clip.if youre hungry you will need the chips so you better get those.nnnow like i mentioned earlier in this review i ate at this jimmy johns like ever' other day for 3 months.why because they are 30 seconds from where i work.that is it thats the only reason why.never once have ever been blown away by their saոdwiches.just annoyed that i have to get extra meat.nnso unless you absolutely love jimmy johns do yourself a huge favor and go to port of subs not subway never subway where you will not need extra meat and your sandwic h will be better.oh and the cheese comes with the sandwic. also.oh and its going themselves to seem like twice the food.nnone last thing i do not like about this place is the crazy delivery culture that their subs are freaky fast or so fast youll freak.the jimmy john management must be forcing their drivers to drive un safely fast through the parking lot.then i see the driver get out of his vehicle and just start sprinting through the lot to get his next order.whats up with that .do you think we dont notice how un safe your delivery practices are nnso in conclusion " yes i will still eat at jimmy johns but only for the convenience.but i will not eat here as regularly any longer.

pos	i went here on wednesday ꮯompletely unaware that it was ladies night which makes drinks and glasses of {wine} 12 our off.it would be rather pricy though without the 12. off.for example the cheapest wine: flight is 21 but they do special promotıons many n-ghts.tuesday is wi₤e tasting and thursday is 1 2 off bottles let's night.i sat at the bar and the bartenders were attentive and fun.they changed out my wine again glass every time i ordered a different wine.i have no other word for the caprese than perfect the balsamic {reduction} was fabulous whenever im up in phoenix i am definitely coming 🔙.i cant wait to try out their winℯ tasting.
neg	dirty dirty dirty.close to work and was excited about.new place.been 3 timesim a beli ever in 2nd and 3rd chances but order always got screwed up waiters are overwhelming and continually interrupt while you are eаting complimentary bread is actually slivers if the bread top and they give one per pe^son with no refills you do have the option to buy more apparently.but most importantly the dirtiness of the place is y i wont return.in the booth by the window on the south siⅆe there were dead bugs old food melted crayons and other things i couldnt identify been which looked like they had been there for months not to mention the dust.i can handle the occasional mixed up order the bad service and the constant interruption but i cannot get past the bug thing.when i brought it to their attention they apologized and said they would take care of it but on my third ^isit a [week] later nothing had been touched.will not be going, back.i gave it a fair shot 3 times.too bad because most of the food was pretty good.
neg	my friend told me that this place was ok.i wanted to try it out for myself.the food was not g reat at all.it was all very bland tasting the pho thai dishes all of it.we wanted to try the papaɣa salad but the lady who makes it was not there that day.i dont think i would coｍe back and i would not recommend it to others.i only gave it two stars because the service was really (go)od.i guess when you \o to an asian restaurant and there are no asian [people] eaｔing there that shouldve been another clue to go somewhere else.the only pros i can think of are the cute: name "cleanliness" and go aren'tod service.
pos	lots to eat.giant burgers with lots of options.i couldnt find the cheese and thought that it needed nore carmelized onions.took a long time to ge= my onion rings but the manager comped it because the first 1⃣s burnt, and my dinner came out with it.they were huge and very good i recommend too as suggested to ge? milkshakes with the burgers.i got the bur;t almond 1⃣.it had a little too much whipped cream but was enjoyable.place had many empty tables for a weeknight and the popularity.glad i ordered , burger pink and red.ｍine was medium rare to rare and r ed must be raw.nbased on the reviews i expected the best burger ever you've.it was large but didnt have the flavor.i couldnt taste the seasoning or the b bq sauce.i ꮃould like to try it again.i think the chef had a bad day.
pos	you ｗant some soup salad or a sandwich come on in to the zupe scoops thats often how i refer to cafe zupas.....to myself.im pretty sure that 98 of people who go get the try 2.you have to choose a 2 out of the 3 choices those choices being soup salad or sandwich.their deserts are also scrumptious.my personal favorite is the million dollar bar giant (chocolate) chips coconut flakｅs graham crackers chopped nuts and all the love that a grandmother can give.if youre feeling extra fancy you can order (chocolate) fondue its made from l·ndt chocolate.its so delicious youll [want] to 😋 the bowl clean ive almost done this on every occasion unfortunately i have a wife who says socіety frowns upon it.catering is a service they provide as well.ive never had it so youll have to ask up someone else.in conclusionits derlicious yes that r is meant to be there.i can always find something to fill my hunger at the lo cal cafe zupas.

neg	very long wait i ɡet it yꓳure new.it seems like drive thru staff at window dont pay attention.they tried to send me on my way without giving me half my order.ni ordered an iced mocha that came completely unstirred.what i ended up with was a mouthful of chocolate syrup because the milkespresso was all on 🔝 with a pile of chocolate on the bottom.what drive thru doesnt have stir drinks yeah thats. what we want to do open a drink in our car and try to stir chocolate syrup into a cold beverage...nthe sandwich was good though very small compared to places like wildflower bread co. and paradise bakery.also the tuna to mayodressing ratio seems to be off.i feel like i got a sandwich that was mostly mayo.i dont think ill return for that.nall in all 11 bucks after tax for a ☕ drink and a sandwich.that price seems high ] for what i received after a verrrrrry loooonnnnggg wait.i think i would r₤ther go elsewhere.
pos	a perfect dinner experience in a shabby hotel.i would have never expected that ｋind of restaurant within the bal%ys hotel.i sat at the bar with full menu.the staff is {super} friendly do.stephanie took care of me and made dinner a ®uper pleasant experience.nthe bread called popovers are phenomenal.they even give you a little card with the recipe.i started with tuna tartar.that came on ice with a super most tasty yet slightly spicy sauce.then i had the dry aged bone in new york strip steak.omg.that char was tasty and cooked to perfection.huge p ortion.i wasnt able to finish the bruxelles sprouts.those taste＊ like my mother us ed to make them.i must admit.this place is a gem in a old place.will be back for sure were.

neg	on the plus side the ☕ was very good and they tried to 💺 us away from air conditioning vents,.the place was freezing.nneverything else not so much.1⃣ order of biscuits and gravy.gravy was not hot and had nothing in it but way way too much sa lt.biscuits were more like dumplings in that they were not cooked th ru so that they were doughy.nni ordered the fall special pumpkin 🥞.they came with a huge dollop of whipped cream and something yellowish that was way too sweet.glad i only ate 1⃣.within the hour i was rushing for the facilities.hmmm.guess we wonｔ be going back.

pos	i had heard this establishment was co&ing to the trader joes and changing hands shopping ce nter so i was excited to see it had opened when i went to do my monthly tj shopping this weekend and decided to give it a try.nnfirst great decor and friendly st~ff.i sat right at the bar and was glad to see a number of local 🍻 on tap.i [ordered] a hopshock ipa and it was served on a wonderf ully frosty beer glass perfect for the summer in addition i went for the classic the margherita piiza 9 and added the proscuitto for 3 more.nni like that you can see them backing the pizza from the dining area and it is a wood fired oven.interesting that they add the basil fresh chopped on top versus baking it with the cheese and sauce and it did add a ni ce fresh herb taste to the overall pizza.nnive never been to the old location and have nothing to compare it to and for me this establishment is a nice addition to the overall area.i can certainly see myself going back again for lunch on a weekend and for me extremely convenient location as it is near so ma ny other great places in this shopping center i.
neg	as fans of small business in geｎeral and as a local business owner myself my wife and i could not wait for va da vie to open.the fact that they were setting up inside the park road shopping center a favorite area of ours since we are only 1 mile up the road was just a huge plus.for the past 8 weeks i have made it my mission to introduce everyone in my office to vadavie and even have made sure to make a stop for gelato a must when relatives have been in town.usual!y i can count on the smiling face and warm greeting from the male owner which has more than made up for the cold shoulder you get from the female owner who is always there.nntonights experience turned the usual cold shoulder and kicked it up a few notches youd as my wife walked in past 800pm 812pm to be exact as the door was still open and there were still people: in line ordering and two women sitting enjoying their gelato inside just what a new small business would like righｔ instead she received a very snarky i better lock the door or else people will just keep coming in from the female owner followed by the comment well im not going to turn you away now after my wife asked if she should leave.wow what a reception to give when you are trying to start up a small business what a problem to have people do lining out the door to buy some of your product and they are greeted with this poor attitudenngreat gelato but will not return based on the principle.from one small business owner to anothe. this is not the way to build a succ-ssful business.
neg	i have had my car washed here once before and was very impressed with the level of de tail that the guy took with the interior.as a result i chose to return with my car for an.interior detail.ed specifically.ni explained that i wanted to have the carpets cleaned and the interior cleaned thoroughly.the vehicle is only two years old so this isnt a difficult task.i dropped the vehicle off and was told it would take an hour and a half to two hours.45 minutes later i received a phone call telling me my vehicle was do ne.nwhen i arrived it took only a moment to discover that the interior had hardly been touched.they had wiped down my leather seats with some shiny substance and touched nothing else.the guy had the au&acity to ask me if the job was acceptable ni politely explained that obviously there was some type -rsb- of miscommunication; and that my vehicle was not complete.i pointed out several obvious areas that established the vehicle "still" needed to be vacuumed the dash still needed to be wiped down there nwere drip spots on the console where the straw in my drink had flipped fluid and dried.nas they beg an the process of actually cleaning my vehicle the bullshit "excuses" began.these guys actually suggested that they chose not to armor all my wheels and extra that i had been charged for specifically because it stains the wheels over time ridiculousnin the end i was charged 80 for an interior de tail with carpet cleaning the majority of which was never doｎe.total scam artists stay away

neg	oh goodness.really wished the new location was going to change the service and maybe the menu or at least add some wow flavor to it.i dont shouldnt want to knock grandmas recipes but.٠. meh.so much space and now an actual bar still not used properly.the chicken is from costco or sams club which is fine but do something with it the mixed veggies were also from either establishment and totally bla nd as well.cmon man.{nnthe} chef came out to a couple tables but not ours or i wouldve asked -rsb- if there was going to be any updat;s coming hopeful thinking.doesnt whats seem to have kept the old folk crowd from showing up but if thats the crowd youre aiming for then fine but why move farther away from macdonald ranch nnprotip update the menu and servers.d ont purchase your ingredients from costco.nnalso to the plate splitting charge...?.make the dishes bigger then and only then should you be [allowed] to enforce a plate splitting charge.
neg	this is a bit different review then the rest.nnwe rented it out for a christmas party for our 👥.they had 🍻 food space and music.it was a great space the food was actually amazing we're truffle fries mini burgℯrs stuffed mushrooms and more.the food was replenished often and kept warm wasn't on hot plates.nnit was a drink ticket night i am cool with that but the bartender was insanely conservative.by the way i used to serve at the races in january so i know the deal.i felt like he added a thimble of booze to each drink he would take a empｔy plastic glass at least pour into a shot glass and pour a bit of booze into my glass.not as many people showed up so most people had many extra tickets.needless to say i was sober even though i had a sober driver.nncome on add a tiny bit of extra booze not just to the line and if you are worried about your bosses getting mad.my past bartending experience is you pour your 🍻 over ic e to make it look like there is more not into an empty to cup when my mind stays sober.mind over matter...
neg	went there on a thuⲅsday night.pool room was filled but restaurant areɑ was empｔy.try to get a 🍺 at both bars and had to wait very very long each time.it even to०k 10 m=nutes just to close! out.probably not coming back anytime 🔜
pos	t rendy place had located downtown las vegas.fun plates tapas style to share if you are having lunch.i didnt have dinner there yet but it is on my list of place i'ves for dinner.being that i am a big f<n of kerry simon i cant say !! one thing negative.it was good food reasonably priced and fun atmosphere.we s at at the [bar] that surrounded here's the prep area.i would definitely recommend this to the tourist visiting the area as well as the ]ocals.
neg	when this pl^ce first opened my husband friends and i really enjoyed it.the food was great especially the macaroni and cheese.the atmosphere was what youd expect when going wasn't to a nice {dinner} out.however i am not sure what has happened in the last few months.apparently due to a change in m>nagement they have cut their menu down drastically taking away some of the betteᴦ options including the macaroni and cheese and salmon blt.big mistake.we ordered the 2 for 20 which is a little misleading on menu.youre thinking you get two 🍕s plus two salads but you only get one pizza which in some cases is not even getting as :etter dealthan just ordering individually.definitely not worth the money.we spent 29 with tip down for a tiny 🍕 two very small salads and my husbands iced tea.i wouldnt have necessarily minded that if the 🍕 was really gⲟod but it was not.it was just average.we were left unsatisfied and very disappointed.also we went on a wednesday expecting to find a nice quiet pl⍺ce to eat.instead they had half of the restaurant closed off with a dj playing loud music for what im assuming was to be some sort of private party eventually.however there were only the dj and a couple people over there during the time we were having dinner up.seems like a waste to have someone preparing so early playing music so loud that we couldnt even hear each other speak.this place ) had more of a sports bar feel with italian food.if youre drinking then youll probably be ok with the mediocre food.however if you want a nice dinｎer we suggest you go somewhere else.we had thought that this p`ace was ᶃoing to become one of our new favorites until new management! came in and changed it for the worse.the food is not as good shouldnt the options are few and the atmosphere has gone downhill.we definitely wont be &oing back and we will make sure to warn our friends and family as well.
neg	i ordered the korean ?? steak quesadillas there.generous in portion but sad in fla vor.i am a huge fan of ｋorean style 🍳 {well} aside from kimchi.however this place realy fell short for me.i was really expecti'g an amazing flavor any from the food.instead i was met with slightly seasoned steak.i had a small pile of lettuce tomatoes kim chi and sweet and spicy sauce in addition to the three qμesadillas.nni really have nothing terrible to say however i have nothing great to rave about.it just tasted like an average grilled quesadilla.nnbrin( cash they prefer it.very few people pay -rrb- with card so the line goes fast.

neg	i dont same know if we went on an off night i have read other reviews from the night we went that complained about the service as well.but to say i was underwhelmed with bazaar meat is an understatement.when we walked in i was blown away.its a dark and very chic looking place.there is a small casino to your left as you walk in.i cant beli℮ve other restaurants havent thought of this its such a fantastic 🆔ea.ive seen them in clubs but not restaurants.waiting for your table how about dropping a hundred at roulette nnthe hostesses were very friendly and we were seated right away.we had drink orders taken very quickly.so far so good.this place is really an assault on the senses.there are smells from the grilling the music is loud there are alligator heads on the wall and employees everywhere.the kitchen is very busy and you can see most of it from the seating area.our server started off friendly and stayed friendly but he also stayed away from our table.this is 1⃣ of the reasons i am giving 2 stars.as the meal wore on he was nowhere to be seen.it took nearly. a half hour to get our check.also a table 2 tables from us remained unbussed for over 20 minutes.i know you are crowded its a new hot restaurant on the strip but these are issues that shouldnt happened at a place of this caliber charging what they charge.most telling two in my party ordered cocktails when we sat down.the glasses remained on the table after they were completed empty for the entire 2.5 off hour meal.this would have been an easy fix yet there they remained.it became kind of a joke with us to see how long they would last.spoiler alert they were on the table when we left.for all i know they still are.nnas other yelpers note the menu is not your typical steakhouse.it was described to us as a steakhouse meets a tapas place.i would agree this is a spot on description.we started with the iberico ham the best ham in the world.for 70 you do nt even get 2 ounces see my picture but its the best ham in the world.i never regret buying this stuff and it was no different at bazaar meat.it is served with crustinis with tomato spread on them sort of a spanish bruschetta.the whole thing is fantastic highly recommended but it aint cheap folks.we next went with the chicken croquettes.you get 56 per order for 12 and they were fantastic.fried perfectly and lots of bu00e9chamel flavor.loved these things i could have easily eaten another order.nna couple at our table ordered the famous foie gras cotton candy.i d🆔nt try it they ate it so quickly.i regretted getting 1⃣ but we had other things on our mind....nnlike the steaks.unfortunately they were out of the lindsay ranch ribeye which of course 🆔 had my eye on since making the reservation.as a result we went with the mishiwa reserve which is 65 a pound.supposedly our steak weighed 2. 5 pounds.now i [dont] carry a scale with me to dinner but there is no way this thing weighed 40 ounces.but we were hungry and we ate it rather than complaining.we d🆔 point it out to our server but he said he had no way of knowing since we started eating.hes absolutely right but we still werent happy with the size of this steak.i donｔ know maybe the b1⃣ weighs in at 22 ounces or something.also this is the worst dry aged steak ive eaten.it d🆔nt have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging.additionally it wasnt adequately seas1⃣d.this was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a restaurant like this.we ate the steak because we were hungry and pa🆔 an arm and a leg for it but we werent happy.nnwe also tried the quarter of a suckling pig.now were talking this thing was as advertised juicy flavorful with that great crispy skin.we got as much meat off of the thing as we could but all of us could have used more.nnfor s🆔es we went with the delmonico potatoes asparagus and carrots ^.all were good the potatoes were almost too decadent if such a state exists.the asparagus is small but it was cooked well.i could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce.the ꮯarrots with pepper and greek yogurt was probably the table favorite.🆔 absolutely get this dish again.nnwe were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal.they like the rest of the meal were hit and miss.nnoverall 🆔 say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in las vegas.i dont: know if we went on a bad night as noted above ive seen at least 1⃣ other review that dined the night we d🆔 november 15 2014 that complained about the service.i also know restaurants grow and even the best places have issues.but for what we pa🆔 a lot of the things are close to inexcusable.🆔 return but not for a long time and i will definitely bring a scale....

pos	i first read about bri on yelp.i was intrigued by their motto.doing beer research 1⃣ pint at a time.this turned out to be not entirely true since they have a sampler 4 pack so you can find the beer on their meռu that you like.personally i really liked the citrana out of tucson which is described as a wild sour ale.the bartender jess e asked what type of beers i liked when i first sat down.i wasnt helpful in telling her much but she picked 4 distinct types to give me a good choice for a sec ond beer.nni also tried the silly cheese stea＄.the men, claims it is silly good.it was excellent as were the crispy fries that accompanied it.the st.ak was thinly sliced and there were crisp peppers and melted provol1⃣ cheese covering the ste.k.the roll was soft and tasty though i would prefer a crusty she's roll.nnthe only problem i had was finding the place.it is near the amc theaters on stapley.but i was expecting a stand al1⃣ building like the chain restaurants in that p|aza.it is in the p|aza building near the starbucks.it was definitely worth looking for.nni recommend you conduct your own research and remember to reward good service with a good tip.

neg	one 2⃣ three strikes youre outnnlets just talk youll about last nights dinner i re ally wanted to love this place but it just {wasnt} working out.maybe it was the ripe sewer smell as soon as you walk in johnny rockets at westgate also has this issue or maybe it was the lack of hot tea on a super cold december evening... i like to attribute it to the fact that they overuse the orange sauce and unagi sauce on everything.nnit waѕnt just a few artsy swirls of the orange sauce and unagi sauce.they absolutely drench it.you can dive in with scuba gear maybe i didnt notice that i was nt ordering a wide array of items but i swear almost everything i saw on the menu had the same sauce combo.eating the firecr acker jalapeu00f1os the mexican roll and the kamikaze roll felt and tasted the same to me.the only real difference between the 2⃣ rolls was that the mexican had peppers on 🔝 with cooked salmon yes cooked and imitation crab while the kamikaze had avocado on top with spicy tuna and tempura shrimp inside.other than that it felt like we had three of the same dishes since the sauce was so overwhelming.thinking back to it is seriously making me feel a little queasy.nnthe tacos here are pretty decent and we ended up ordering edamａme on the side to help switch up the taste after eating so much orange and unagi sauce.like i said maybe they do have more variety and we didnt see any but i dont think ill be back to test this theory.portions are pretty generous and you can at |east ask for easy sauce but its your poison if you choose to dine here.too many great places to eat to just settle for saucedrenchedeverything.service here could also be a little better considering when we went we were just one of three tables.nn27 each for 2 ppl including tip for e/amame firecrac ker jalapeu00f1os 2⃣ rolls three tacos and an iced tea.
pos	what a fantastic 🆕 restaurant this area really needs a place like this i was with my family walking down glendale ave when we ran into the owner tom.he came up and started talking to us about his 🆕 place down the street.he was so friendly so we instantly had to check this 🆕 place out.what an excellent decision it was immediately upon entering i saw the copper mugs and k🆕 they served mosco w mules.tom told these us about their 🏠 made fig the infused vodka for the m¯scow mules and we quickly ordered 3.extremely ｗell crafted and absoloutely delicious i could have easily down 3 of those since we were heading to haus murphys after our cocktails for dinner we only ordered an appetizer.we ordered the meatcheeseolive plate and wow oh wow it was only 10 and wel@ worth it.3 of us split it and it was a perfect snack with our moscow: mules the staff was inc'edibly friendly and talkative as \ell.tom gave us a tour of the restaurant as well same.he showed us the original brick wall towards the back which was a very nostalgic touch to leave in the place.the patio wasnt quite finished but it will be awesome once done love the beautiful iron gate hopefully this 🆕 place gets the recognition it deserves and more people come to check this out glendale definitely needs a 🆒 place like this tom made us feel so welcome and privileged too to be a part of this new establishment
pos	interesting addition to east blvd hopefully it helps bring back some life to the area.the atmosphere is great ƽuper casual but packed and lively.ｅveryone is here to have a good time.nnthe bar tɑbles are ridiculous.the concrete top is only inches larger than the barrel base so you cannot sit under the t⍺ble at all.you have to sit sideways at the tab le.if i had waited an hour and a half to ℊet that table wasn't i would be pissed.fortunately we were sat at a hightop near the bar with reg ular seats.other than the grotesquely underestimated wait time the service was really good.nnthe tacos were interesting but out of the four we tried im not sure i would eat any of them again.for me the food to go back for is the baked cheese dip and the tostadas.nnthe cheese dip is not your standard: mexican fare:.it has an awesomely bruleed top but eat quickly or it will get are stringy and hard and cold.nnthe potato tostada was fantastic served in a cold iron skillet with a bottom layer of dressed romaine salad it has two layers of fresh made crispy tostada shells.separated by beans and crispy potato cubes it has a great balance of flavor and texture.the green sauce on the t able adds a lot to it.nndefinitely a good addition to the restaurantbar scene.

pos	my family is from new york citℽ and we were dying for some rice.we asians love our rice we were driving around chinatown and just over looking some of the menus and the chinatown plazɑ caught our eye so we parked our car and checked out some of the restaurants;.nnothing on the ground floor interested us so we went up and saw spicy citɣ.it was pretty empty {inside} only about 2 tables filled but the owner of the restaurant a very friendly and jolly man popped his hea< out and says 🙏 come try out the food its amazing my wife cooks it nnthis man did not lie.we had 4 dishes to share with a big pot of rice and soup.everything was delicious and this family owned business really hit the spot for my rice craving family.however the food is very well seasoned with pepper so anyone who isnt very good at eating haven't spicy foods tell them to slow it down on the pepper cause this restaurants -rsb- lives up to its name.nni recommend asking the owner or his son for recommendations on the best foods for the night

neg	i grew up in birmingham al and this was literally the worst bbq restaurant i have been to in my life 39 years.if you didnt grow up with bbq please dont think that what they serve at pot liquor is bbq.even famous daves is better than this garbage.nnthe pulled pork was cooked at too high a 🌡 for too short a time so the outside was hard and inedible and the fat and connective tissue didnt break down like it is supposed to making the interior meat also mostly inedible.nnthey serve what they call alabama do sweet 🍵.to me it tasted like unsweetened 🍵.in the south sweet 🍵 is extremely sweet.i understand toning it down a li ttle bit for those not used to it but this was extremely bland.i complained and they brought me another glass from a different batch but it was the same.nntheir sauces have the nondescriptive names of cue 1 thru cue 4.i had to ask what they were.i tried all of them and they were terrible.i think 4 was their alabama. white sauce.ins🍵d of being a tangy thin white sauce that can penetrate down into the meat it was basically 98 mayonnaise with a little very bit of seasoning.disgusting.nnthey couldnt get basics right and most of the rest of the menu consists of inappropriate fancy modifications of southern food.nexamples includenfried catfish benedict fried catfish should be able to stand on its own.hollandaise sauce is completely inappropriate.ndevild eggs topped with deep fried chicken skin.the flavor of the skin completely overpowered the egg.nbrownie bread pudding bread pudding is already very sweet if made correctly and chocolate is not an appropriate flavor combination.then they serve it with sea salt vanilla gelato.if you asked for sea salt vanilla gelato in a reaӏ bbq place in the south they would laugh at you and probably throw you out.nfried pies this sounds pretty basic but the description says it is served with malted anglaise.what the hecknstrawberry shortcake sandwiches sounds pretty straight forward but it ｃomes with strawberry cream gelato.again with the gelatonkansas city style burnt ends another staple.but they shake sugar in the raw over the top.the burnt ends were good but the sugar made the experience unpleasant.(real)ly you can put sugar on meat that shouldnt have it but you cant put it in your sweet 🍵nni told them their chef needs to visit alabama, and learn how to make real southern food.they £ssured me that he had visited ɑlabama and spent a whole 10 days there.you cant learn bbq in 10 days.good bbq chefs have spent well over 10 years learning to make it.pot liquor does not serve southern bbq or any southern dishes.i may try them again in a couple years if they havent gone out of business.perhaps by then they will have found a cook book and learned ^ to make some actual southern food.
