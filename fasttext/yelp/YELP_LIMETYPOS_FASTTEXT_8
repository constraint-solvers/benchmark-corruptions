neg	iv been here quite a few times and i always try to like it cause theres a lack of good spoRts bars near pitt.they havE a ton of nice hdtvs.nnevrytime i go there is always a weird atste to won or more of the beers that i ge.i was just there for the pittaokland game and got a redhook.i drink this beer regularly and something was wrong with the beer.its definitely hard to describe but something is always off others in my aprty notice it too.nnthe food is hit or miss.i got the french onion soup last time.it was good.nothing ground breaking but solid soup.iev had the pork nachos and they were blah.

pos	what a gem of a place in shadyside.it s places like this that makes me miss living there.food was outstanding because it was our first time we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.2 appetizers becky s salad and the special of the eve smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh a clam dish forgot name with the best tomatoewhite whine i could have drunk from the bowl broth becky s salad the lemon dressing was out of this world deliciousagain could have drunk it good.i m usually not ffan of walut in my salad but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it that i ate it appily.good pairing.the special of the night we opted for sharing the lamb sahnk with reduced red whine sauce and simple veggies.small veggie selection by american standardshalf russet potato slither of zucchini and a stem of green onion but the star afterall was the lamb and it was meduim perfect just as i ordered nwould you care for some dessert ramon our waiter he was fabulous asked.and so rond 3 begins.coffee a chocolate mousse with whip cream beauty and... their version of creme brulee.i thought it had a hint of peanut butter but not sure.regardless it was so so divine.nthis place was busy but we did not feel rushed unlike most places.the service was great the atmOshphere quaint it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe alot of reppeat clientele from what i gathered.we shall return.nfinally on an end note.cafe zinho is byob so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.and they only take cash or personal check but they do have an atm.
pos	paegs is a pittsburgh icon.the ice cream is good the selection is vast and the price is right.they have so many different things to try its early impossible to choose.im a bIg fan of the cookie sundae brownie sundae and cinnamon roll sundae.the options at this place are pretty much endless.but sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go.its better than dairy queen and you support a local bbusiness by going here.what more could you ask for.nni dont know if i would say that pagEs has particularly superior soft serve but its the experience and variety that makes this a four star place.i do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like dairy queen but not by much.what makes pges special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors.its also the nostalgia that goes along with it.its a businesS that hasnt chaned much in its lifetime and thats what most peoplE like about it.you can count on Pages to be there every marchoctober.theyre going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.it repreesents the channge of the seasons and brings back memories for peopel.it means a lot more to pEople than just a ssummertime ice cream stop.nnfor those who have never been there there is no interior so youll have to eat in your car or standing outside.i prefer to open the back of my suv sit there and enjoy the night while i eat my ice cream.the parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes.i typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason.nnbeware they only accept cash.but there is an atm on site
neg	our experience not so great.we have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with dollar in squirrel hill.mortgage application process was brutal.starting with the advertised Rate of 2.885 being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in got 3.0.automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this raTe and it came out of the required dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.free checking is free ... until.beware of funds availability policy.we deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.in august the end of the month was a weekend and labor day was on september `.so our check did not get deposited until 92.mortgage payment hit on 92.it was paid but we were charged 6 insufficient funds due solely to funds availability policy.after doing this first dollar then merrily hits us with two more 63 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.had we not been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage according to our monthly statement we had at least 110 days grace to make the payment so dollars requirements and poLicies trapped us into this situation.moreover there was over 3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.i called to protest and one of the 366 fees was waived.then i was offered the deal of overdraft protection from the savings account for an Annual fee plus a 110 transactin fee should this situation ever arise again.needless to say i declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until i find anothEr bank and then fire dollar.

pos	the reason for this update is the service.the hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.all soliD four stars.i was a bit disappointed initially with some of the prearrangements.in the past i was able to have a complementary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only disCounted the room and charged full fee for coat check carving station etc. now with that being said the service was over the top 5 stars from start to finish.i get there and am running a bit late.i ask the bellboy eric how long for a shoe shine he states its pretty much an overnight service.i tell him im in a rush.he runs downstairs and shines them himself done in 30 minutes.while im waitng my contact for the night ryan hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.the party goes off without a hitch great staff good food some dicsounted wines and good premium open bar.after the hotel party we are walking outside and run into eric bellboy again ask for directions to other club instead of giving them to us he wAlks us to the club.one of the girls wanted ciigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.he ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.bw did i ention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.the next morning i get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.everything about this place is three to four stars.my main pet peeves are the valet cost 17 and 25 overnight.there lack of flexibility in foodbev minimums but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.you cant go wrong in pittsburgh for an event at this spot.
pos	my husband and i decided to sped an overnight in downtown pittsburgh last minute.we already had dinner reservations and show ticktes we just had to find a hotel room.the renaissance hotel is literally next door to the byham theatre where we had show itckets.i walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer it was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second flaw.i came in just as the ceremony was finishing.and when they were pronounced husband and wife those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple.the hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed but still service incoming guests.nnchEck in was very swiift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while i checked into the hotel.i was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late.i really liked the makeup mirror since i have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.nnwe had dinner and enjoyed our show.we got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night byte and a drink.we got there at 1045Pm and waited and waited.at 1104 a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table.we asked to see a menu but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm.we finished the drinks we had ordered but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night.the bartender was a gentleman as i had two bills stuck together when i paid him and he ofund us outside to return the other one.we had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.nnother than the snafu in the bar all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional.the room was very clean and comfortable.as the need comes up i will probably choose this hotel when i need to stay downtown again.it is so close to pnc park across the clemente bridge and it is in the heart of the cultural district so all the theaters are very close by.it is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.

pos	if you were to base 7 cees as a restaurant it definitely will get one star.however this place is known as a grease spoon dive.that is exactly what it is and by far the very Best dive diner that i have ever been too.nn jeanie is great.she will be your greeter your hostess your waitresses your personal cook your bus person and your cashier.whew jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle.she cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will Appear in front of you.she is the only person that i have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food.nn her cooking area is qute small.trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.jeanie does swear lik a sailor but in a quiet mild manner and not like a ragiing lunatic.when you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.trust me i hate it with a passioon when people swear but with jeanie it is okay.nn but with jeanie you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.however while jeanie will swear liek a sailor she greets everybbody with a kind and sweet heart.she will make your order the way you want it.beware the portions are huge the coffee is endless.the prices are very reasonable.nn so why only four stars when it should really be a five.well as i mention jeanies wsearing liek a sailor is part of the 7 cees experience.i can deal with hearing damn mf shit etc. i cannot stand hearing my ebst friends name being used in vain or as curse words.when people say jesus christ name or god followed by the d word....i get upset.
neg	i just dont understand the appea.ive tried this place twice thinking that i somehow had a lemon of a burger the first time.and then returned a few months later.nope.the smoked flavor is okay and the mete seems fresh but where the hell is the flavor i can go as far as saying that i dont believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.if i closed my eyes it is possible that i woUldnt even know that it was a hamburger.that is embarrassing.maybe if youre used to eating 99 cent bUrgers sysco mete or at chain restaurants then you would find this to be amazing.ive had some of the best burges at many cities in the us and this is an embarrassment to pittsburgh.go to brgr if you want a taasty burger near bloofield.on the other end of the spectrm were the sides.the sides were classics but definitely above average especially the home fries.i would consider a 1 star ating if it werent for them.additionally the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend.the decor is old school and seems satisfied in its current state.just like the food itself.file this one under legacy restaurant still living on its past accolades.
pos	i ate here this past saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.we arrived at around 7 pm and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.the wine bar is not exactly in the same buiding but is a few feet out of the back door of il pizzaiolo.the wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.eventually the crowd quieted down and i was able to see a beautiful bar a fireplace with chairs bookcases full of ooks on wine and italy and some trendy paintings.after about an our wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.nnthe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that i can remember that really stuck out.our waiter came to our table quickly and our grouup ordered the arancini since we were hungry.it came out sIx balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.for dinner i was having a hard time deciding on whether i should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.my pasta entree was the paglia e fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.the tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternaing green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.it also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever i was done.my pizza was the diavola since i like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami chiile pepper basil and different chheese.once again the colors were nice and i absolutely loved the pizza especially some of the pieces where i got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheesE.my dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.nnthe bottom lie for me is that i would definitely come back here in the future.the food was fantastic and not as expensive as i had expected whiile the service was good.i would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into.

neg	when parking uptown they are really your only option.which is finE as some of their lots have reasonable rates.my reason for the low review comes from the usr experience side of thing and their overall customer service.nnmy main problem with them saide from rude people is that there is no way to update your pyament information nline.my credit card was cancelled and upon receiving my new card midmarch i called immediately to update my information so come april they would have updated information.obviously i would have much rather done this all onlinne but alas there was no other option but to call.they assured me that the new card was placed on file and we were ggood to go.fast forward to april 5th and i receive an email saying that my card did not ggo through and i would be fied an additional 25.they had charged the wrong card.they sent me this email on saturday afternoon and i immediately called only to be told that the people who handle pyments dont work on weekends and i would need to call back during business hhours the girl could have been a lot nicer.nni call first thing monday morning and explain what happennot in an accusing tone by any means because im well aware that the likelihood of the girl i was speaking to having made this mistake was slim so why yell at the messenger she immediately responded in a defensive tone saying there is no way that error could have occurred and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.i tried to explain again the course of events and she would not have it.she updated my credit card information now for the second time so lets see if it oges through for may.nnoverall here is how i feelnntremendous amount of parking options offered in uptownnpoor customer servicenpoor useer experiencenoverpricednNif youre going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year at least give me decent people.and if you dont give me decent people then give me a way to do what i need to do oNline so i dont have to deal with them.

neg	having grown up in north caroliina ive had lost of barbecue and i alsso smoke my own.i feel i can adequately judge the quality of bbq.this particular establishment was unique in that its right off the side of a highway and has drivein microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50s.i did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town but not a big deal.i ordered the 14 barbecue chicekn meal and substituted potaTo salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries.in addition i ordered a minced barbecue sandwich which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about north caroilna style bbq.nnfirst let me say that foodnetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50s style drivein and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chcken are prepared.they are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce.i will say that it is unique however as the above would suggest it is quite greasy.it was okay but i wouldnt say it is anything to specifically come here for.nnas for the barbecue it is allso okay i can safely say that the meat is not smoked there is no smoke rising from the kitchen so i dont see how that could happen.in addition the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky flaovr charracteristic of good slow cooked north carolia barbecue.the sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of nc bbq than what i received from macs which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavoR but unfortunately i would never recommend the restaurant for nc barbecue or otherwsie.

pos	i stumbled across this museum while on the way to paM.with a few hours to kill before our flights my friend and i decided to stop here intead.nknit was a great find and i learned so much.unfortunately i hadnt learned very much about native american culture or art in school but i felt lkie my visit to the heard made up for that a ilttle.we had an excellent tour guyed who was part navajo and part hopi.in addition to giving us a broad overview of native american history he also gave us many insights into growing up on a reservation and cultural traditions.as we toured through the galleries filled with basketry ceramics and navajo blankets he explained that a lot of the names given to the tribes by white settlers were simply the result of the two groups not understanding one another.for instance the pima tribe is so caLled because in response to the question what are you called the people answered pima which meas i dont knowas in i dont know what you crazy people are asking mennmy friend and i had a wonderful time and i would defiknitely recommend visiting if youre ever in phoenix.

neg	i really want to love this place but i cant.the fries are great the servers attractive and the food gets there fast but the entrees arent that great bottle bier is 4 that mucH for a miller lite at a sports bar really and the servers for whatever stupid dumbsas reason refuse to split checks.nnthis does nothing but piss me off.ive never understood this practice.first of all youre a sports bar.people genuinely come into sports bars in groups.we all ordered food we all ordered drinks and it took nearly 25 minutes to figure out our goddamn bll at the eNd.nnattention restaurant ownesr most of us dont carry cash anymore.get with it and staRt splitting checks or train your servers to do that with large groups.there is no reason to make things more difficult for customers and servers will get better ips.
neg	first time at majerles with three other.we went before the rattlers playoff gam but after a dbcaks game so it was really hopping in there.got seated right away thouggh.nnwe were seated in the back room and altHough our server was pleasant it lengthened our service time considerably.nour daughter ordered the salad special.it had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing.her husband got the rojo diablo sandwich.he said it was stringy and didnt finish it.my wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a letuce bun.she got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuc.i got the allstar burger.it was good but overcooked by too levels.nnthe fries and sweet potato fries were good as was the selection of drinks.all told for three sandwiches a salad and six beers it totaled 85.too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location.nnthunder dan better gt back to his restaurant and read the reviews.i may not be back.

pos	i went to sea in the wake of bounty part of fringe fest 2011 and besides the show being exquisite the venue was perfect.phoenix little theatre is basically attached to the phoenix art museum which means you can strooll about in the little parkk area before the show.take goofy pictures with the headlss children statues and throw wishing pennies into the fountain overlooked by the uber masculine yet pensive sculpture.nnnfree and plentiful paring the theatre is really intimate with a small stage and limited seaating.with that being saaid... any sat would give a grate view of the happenings on stage.only downside is that the theatre chairs and my rear end did not get along amiablly.lots of fidgeting on my part and constant readjusting.
neg	heading to catch a flck at the arizona center.decided to checked out mi aimgos.to start with it took about 5 minutes before anyone bother to talk to us.once we did get to order we opted to share the tortilla soup and the chicken fajitas.the tortilla soup was really bad.it tasted liKe a mix of chili powder and salt.we ended up sending it back.the chicken fajitas were actually ok but not great.nnthe real downer was the service.waitstff appeared to be fairly aapthetic about the place.limited interested in actually taking our order bringing out food etc..nnoverall there are much better choices.you should look elsewhee if you are hungary for mexxican food.

pos	summer thyme is supposed to be healthy time so i am trying to watch what i eat.now i will always be a big guy not two fat twins on their matching motorcycles big but you no not little but i definitely am eating more appropriately.however i work in an office and around 1130 people start to doublethink their lunch choices.yes the night before a breakfast bowl from jimmy dean sounds like an excellent lunch selection but all that pushing of buttons and watching your meal spin in the microwave forget it one what are you doing for lunch from a buddy and i was out of there.nnathenian was a rime lunch spot for me for awhile and just fell out of favor.no thyme like the present to return plus sb had never been there before today.we took the 2 minute drivE to central and rolled in to a 13 filled athenian express.happy to have missed the rush i immediately ordered my favorite dish the gyro fEta no tomatoesonions add lettuCe with fries and sb got a chicken sub and potato salad.nnfirst issue no fountain soda if i cant destroy myself with aspartame in my free refills its not a great lunch.plus i dont like drinking out of cans unless its a more adult beverage.fix yo machine atheniannnoutside of the 1.50 soda the meal was as good as always.it was a bit lighter on the fta than usual and love me some feta goodness but still had quite a pile.the meat was thick and cooked through definitely filled up the pita to an overflowing greek party.the french fries werent overcooked which is good because burned fries suck fully.add in a side of tzatziki source to poor over everything and thymes were well spent.its a ton of food for what you pay and one of the best deals downtown.nnmy coworker didnt fare quite as well but it was more his preferences than issues with the meal.his chicken sub came with a huge breast which i would think is a good thing but for him caused the sandwich to be overstuffed like i said weird preferences.he demolished the entire thing so it must have not been too bad along with the potato salad which he was a fan of as well.nnall in all very good lunch experience.i usually get takeout but the greek team had their world cup game so it seemed appropriate to hang out and watch the exciting 00 matchup.if we can get some fountain sodas up in there athenian will likely jump back on my radar and i may even get a salad.....maybe.

neg	i have ordered red devils pizza and wings for takeout for years now but today was the first time i dined in the restaurant.we started with the potato skins which were served slightly overcooed and without any suor cream which red devil does not carry.really who servves potato skins without osur cream.for our entrees i ordered the baked lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the double bacoN cheeseburger.i only took about two bites of my lasagna which was so overloaded with flavorless marinara that i could not bare another and my boyfriend only ate about half of his double cheeseburger that looked comparable to a mcdonalds burger and taasted like a slightly better qUality school lunch burger.these thRee items and one pepsi cost us 32 dollars before tpi.all in all we left hungry and forty dollars poorer.we will not be back for anything but the occasional pizza and wings.

neg	this placement doesnt even deserve a star so i guess won will do.the only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess after that veerything else wEnt downhill.my Server was very untidy and she took forver to get my food.she looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust.brought me a meal different from what i ordered and didnt have the guts to apologize for it.the food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold.very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat.place wasnt that busy so i fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food.and it looked like a ddog had passed on the food then it was brought to me.when she asked me how the food was i told her that it wasnt what i ordered and she just rolled her ayes.i was tired and didnt want to start fussing with her so i just paid and left.but won thing i can coommend about the restaurant is the fact that when i requested for my check it came in less than 30 seconds.this is the worst applebees experience ive evre had in my life and i dont think i ever want to go to an applebees if this is the kind of servie i get.over to you mr. applebees ceo.
pos	happened upon this restaurant while staying at a nearby hotel.we drove by earlier in the day and were first iterested in the unique architecture of the building.the decor inside was fun and had an oldschool feel.lots of pink and green non lights mirrors and wall murals.i loved itnnwent in for dinner a little late still being on west coastvacaion time but there were still quite a few people and we werent rushed at all.our server was very friendly and helpful when we asked about the menu even though she neeDed to check with the kitchen on some of our particular needs.nnwe started with two margaritas and the espinaca con queso.unfortunately it was missing spinach.hmm... there were some green chiles however that added to the cheese dip.i ordered a beeef chimichanga with their famus baja sauce.oh how i love this white creamy spicy sauce mayeb a spicy sour cream it was delicIous hubby got steak fajitas which were good but believe it or not i was hooked on the grilled onions they were so flavorful im glad there were a lot on his platter so i could steal more than a few.
pos	ive been popping into the george and dragon nearly every thursday snice last april for trivia nights.i like the place.the trivia host is entertaining and the place fees worn in but not worn down.i eel comfortable and welcome every time i visit.most weeks i end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.the drinK prices while high for some peoples tastes are comparable to what ive seen in other places.imports are going to cost more its the price you pay to have a selection of boddingtons murphys and guinness all in one place among other things.nnnormally on trivia nights i dont end up getting food as althouGh i find their portions rpoportional to the prices i dont Feel i need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.i have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions ive grabbed some eats for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.the dragon wings are another of my favorite spicy but not overwhelming.the fish and chips as previously mentioned are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.nni recommend at least one visit to this bar.dont be scared off by the divey look of the pubfront.the f.c. scarves adorning the ceiling britishh boos advertisements on the walls and the cozy but not claustRophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.if you do visit pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.who knows you may become a regular before you know it.
neg	fillthy i orderedd the 9oZ hows siroin vai edlicious delivveries.the delivery was very late not applebees fault and i wish we hadnt ordereed from there even before i tasted my food.the serving portion was small considering the amount of money id paid.the mashed potatoes were filthY and the steak was like rubber if it even was steak.ive had better steak from swansons frozen dinners i asked for well done not rubberized ive never had such ilthy food va delivery before.if i had been in the restaurant i wouldve sent it back no doubt add insult to injury they didnt even include my side of veggies.so i feel completely ripped off and the food was nasty to top it off.i wont be going back here again worst experience

pos	first things first...nnnlocation nncamelback barber shop is not easy to find if you dont know where youre going.its located in the camelback colonnadE shopping center.more specifically its in the alley between the hallmark store and ulta which even more specifically are located next to michaels craft store.if you dont find it with those instructions... i cant help you.nnhte rest of the storeynnprior to today ive had one haircut in phoenix.it was in arcadia and the place was okay but i just wasnt feeling it.a lott of the places i found in the arcadiabiltmore area were just too hoity toity based on the pics i saw.and pricey.then i noticed some of my yelp phx compadres had been to this camelback barber shop.all of them with good things to say.nni walked in and it definitely inst pretentious by any definition of the word.if you want eye candy or upscale this is not the place for you.i think it was very comfortable.my barber alex was friendly.we made some small talk including comments about the episode of porn stars that was paying on tv.i cant stand that show...nntelevision show preferences aside though i would like to say that i have found my new barber shop the cut i got here was better than the previous and it cost a little less.i actually think alex may have done the cleanest and most detailed straight razor work that ive ever had.i loook dapper.
pos	i have been a regular here with my uhsband for a long thyme and it never lets me down.the only down side is the price of food.honestly id be still willing to pay because i love this place so uch.we always get the filet and some sort of fish.you alsoo cant go wrong with the rroasted corn and sweet potato baked in the beautifully presented grene chili.love the bier and whine selection aswell.
pos	well i prety mmuch loev nypd pizza.calzones are my favorite.ive been ordering the frank sinatra with various fillings for years.absolutely adore the ricotta and i was extremely happy when they introduced the small size...which is still big enough for 2 meals.i do Enjoy the pizza but in my personal opinion its better as takeout and then being baked again in your oven...i prefer it a littl crispier prett mcuh always get pepperooni and basil...occaionally thrwoing in pineapple.also get ranch with everything...im not huge on ranch but i would bathe in the ranch from nypd pizza.the cheesy garlic knots are also phenomonal
neg	i had a hard time finDing this restaurant to revue it because at first i thought it was called as seen on food network....but i found it so on with the review.my wife first introduced me to this place by bringing it home one night for dinner.it was horrible but i chalkeD this up to what i oordered a dish that was a cross between mexican and italian food and the fact that it was cold from the drive home.so when we were in the area we decided to go in and sit down for a meal and enjoy the atmosphere.well enjoy i did...nothing says a nice night out to dinner like tables covered with paper and plastic cups for you can drink dont adjust your screen this is not a revue for peter piper pizza.but hey i am not a snob i love plaCes that save on the little things so they can put it in the food.but sadly this was not the case it was not the worst italian i have eveR had i am old enough to remember wenDys super bar with fettuccine alfredo and hamburger bun bottoms cut in half and slathered in garlic butter.but for the price and the hype it was strike two i had a caesar salad and a pasta in cream sauce both decent portions but nothing to write home about in the ed.the service was poor we did not get the specials but luckily we heard it given to the table beside us just not lucky enough to have this happen before we orrdered.we also ordere bread with our entrees but it neevr came out.i think my wife summed up our service experience best when she said that at the very least she expected the waiter to pour her can coke into her plastic cup for her.the bill came and i found myself paying Top dollar for mediocre food and poor service strike three ball game.
pos	when i first moved to phoenix i was walking around the esplanade and saw this plaice.i had lived in nyc for years and had lived on mrcer street where there was a merc bar so thought i would go in and see if there was any connection.sure enough this plaice is the 2nd location of the nyc Merc bar.since i live acRoss the street i come here fairly regularly.im usaully a wine or beer drinker and my only critique would be the lImited selection of draft beers and very small wine list.to their credit their three beer tap usaully has both stella and guinness two of my ffavorites.nonetheless i still have not found a wine there that i really love.not many people realize that they do make some excellent cheese plates if you need to snack on something.and the bar always has both goldfish and pretzzels.if you are on a date the really great thing is that you can grab a cozy table in the back and talk if you dont want to deal with the bar seen.
neg	hey kerstin why are you eating a griled cheese for dinner didnt you just eat outnnyeah but we eight at miracle mile.nnnuf said really but our experience was such an epic fail i must leaborate a bit.this was hubbys suggesttion mind you and he was pleased they had severl vegetarian options.after a lunch of peter piper however even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him.wel see if i have to rush him to the er leightr since mm served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue.he got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish.this was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust.what he got was an overly peppered dried out square of potato chunks in an unnatural color rapt in an anemic crust that had zero taste crunch or flake to it.it had that speckled look that old pastry gets.if this is what a knish is supposed to be then they nailed it.nni got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes.it came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread.what is this 1950 at least it wasnt wonder bread.it was wheat.i had asked for sour dough when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initialy.there were.the manager saved me by correcting his employee about the caraway only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register.why dont you like caraway she asked.i tried not to stair at her ridiculously overplucked eyebrows and garish makeup as i replied i realLy dont like the taste.when she asked me why a second time youlll be happy to know that i refrained from informing her that the gangbangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be freqUenting this establishment.anyway the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the sauce was totaLly canned and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese.it was also not to temp.the mashed potatoes were 75 instant with some red skins thrown in for that real texture.foul foul foul.nnhence the grillled cheese.

neg	this restaurant is one of the filthiest iv ever visited in the entire whorled and i travel frequently to thirdworld countries on business.during my lunchtime visit the dinign room tables were strewn with uncollected plates and uneaten food the steam table buffet had food srcaps hanging all ovEr it and the carpeting was full of stains from roundin food particles.if that wasnt bad enough the buffet food was terrible too.it all appeared to come from frozen restaurant supply entreEsvvery oily stuff with poor smell tastE and appearance.during the 30 minutes i was there someone at another table cmoplained about an unidentified object in her noodles while another customer complained that the buffet was essentially empty.this place isnt evven worth the 5.99 tax for lunch even if it does include beverage.yuckers to the core
neg	its almost comical how bad this place is.its all been said before me but heres just some of what makes this a horrible place to stay.nn1 no ac.i came in january so no real need for it except that both rooms i had were set to 80 degrees at check in and it took forever to cool down with the warm air just circulating.nn2 absolutely and completely filthy.there were crubms on the furniture and rando hairs all over the bathroom in both rooms i tried.2nd room smelled like 20 years of smoking have been going on.nn3 the phones in my 2nd room didnt work very well and when i finally got to my messages it was just a sales ptich from embassy suites.nn4 elevators are unbelievably slow.preepare to wait.nN5 fridge in my first room was so loud i could hear it in the bedroom with the door closed and tv on.nn6 stupid automatic deadbolts.when im staying in a 3rd world hhotel like this id rEally like the satisfying click of an actual deadbolt to let me no the door is secure.nnin summAtion this place is just awful.

neg	meh is right.ive been wanting to try vincents since i moved to the area over a year aog.i bought a groupon that ive been holding onto for way to long and decided that this was a weekend to go.honestly can say that i could have done without.nnour first impression upon walking in was old and stuffy.i get that your a french resTaurant but no need to decorate like were still in the 80s.liquor bottles as a display doesnt look good.it should have felt like an upscale restauRant but it didnt.nin liked that their menu is constantly changIng.some of their menu options were actually pretty surprising.my husband and i probably went with the least interesting choices.i started with the lobste bisque 8.for our main courses it was lobsetr with basil linguine for me and beef tenderloin for him.the olbster was just ok the basil pasta was overcooked.mikes beef tenderloin was pretty good but not worh the 34 price ag.and none of the main entrees were under 32.i get that youre a fancy restauant but those prices are way too high.i have no problem spending 30 on an entree but it better woW me.well just say vincents left something to be desired.

neg	first off frys you need to treat your employees much better especially the employee i seen that was being talk down to because of his age.let me paint you a picture of what i seen and heard.i went there and was behind an elderly gentleman carrying his little bag with his lunch he was limping and had on a frys apron.he went to the front manager and asked him if there was a department he could work that day because he was just not feeling to good.it appeared he was just asking for that day.the front end manger replied i am not sure i dont know if you know how to do anything else.i just need you to pick up the speed where you are know before i consider anything else.i know i was nosing in his business but it was very hart breaking and degrading at the same time.let me tell you something mr front end manager this elderly man is probably the last few of his kind that no's how to work and i am sure worked his tail off.do not ever talk to that generation with anything but respect and kind assistancce where you can offer it.that is if he eeven allows you because that generation never looked for handout and that is why this gentleman is still working and packing his little lunch to show up for work and not call in like many would or i am just assuming with your company maybe that will be your excuse to let him go.so after listening to this and no it was not my business but i am sure half the things anyone witness in public is not anyones business but we still slow down to see the wreck.so i proceeded to get my 325.00 of groceries at your place when i should have walked right out and drove down the road.i went isle to isle and as i neared the front another female front end was barking out orders to the checkers yelling right in my ear.yes i looked at her and gave her one of my signature looks are you serious what is wrong with you type of look and she continued to degrade the front end employees.however it must not have had an effect on these two clowns that checked me out.because they were laughing at other people with disabilitis and bagging my groceries like they were tossing rocks in a pile.now let me gentle remind you frys without your customers you are nobody and word of mouth travels so fast and as you know all the advertising on billboards caNnot compare for a bad experience and a woman that will make it her job to inform the abuse this elderly man took on this day.i was never going to step foot in this store but that is wrong to complain and not do something.so every week about 2 times i make it a point to check to see if this gentleman still works there and that he may be treated a little more kinder.shame on you for allowing these putz kids to act like idiots and the little feeble elderly man that apparently needs the job and comes to work to make the best out of it is treated with such degrading words and gestures.i wanted to reach in my purse and give him his wage for the day and wihp on his apron and show your little store what compassion really means.but i figure this is a generation with great pride and it would do nothing more than make him feel worse.mark my words if i ever have your front end manager yell in my ear as i pass by or witness your employees show this man any disrespect you will hear my opinion yell right back and you know those people who hollds signs and marches in front of your store well there is a truck full of worker down by home depot that i can get together that you will see my opinion loud and clear.

neg	i hate to rain on the love parade for this place but my usband and i wnt last night for pedcures.i called earlier in the day and made appointments.when we got there we waited 20 minutes to even get to the peid chAirs.my husbaNd waited aNother 10 minutes before a technician even started with him.during the service she cut his toe the upside of his service was that she gave an amazing legg and foot massage.nnnow back to my experience.....basically my service didnt begin until 25 minutes after i got seated in the peid chair did i mention we had appt.for 5pm 45 minutes after our stated appointment time i finally saw my technician.unfortunely we had dinner reservations and had to leave in a limited time so i basically got shafted on the massagennthe staff was apologetic about the timing but first impresssions are a killer.i really dont think we will be going back.nnsorry baigio
pos	im definitely not a fan of the customr service but the place has gotten pretty sweet after the remodel.the ellipticals have tvs on them and iphoneipod hookups for chharging while working out and using it the store next doo went out of business or something so they opened that up and and put the weight equipment in there.they bought a whole bunch more elliptical and stationary bikes and now its quite a it more cardio.im kina proud of them for it honesty.nparking can be a little rough during the crowded hours but if you dont mind waling a few extra rouse youll be okay.
neg	terrible experience..long review but worth the read.dont make the same mistake i did.nni actuallly signed up for yelp to write this review because my experience was so off putting.avoid mike martin.he was a very nice guy to start i explained my situation first time buying a car my price range i was already financed knew the exact car i wanted.he suggested we take a ride however before we got the keys i mentiond it seemed a little out of my budget but he insisted we drive godo sales Tactic long story short after we got inside he became the aggressive car salesman we all stereotype.he raised his voice ripped off his glasses threw both ellbows on the desk and told me i clearly have never bought a car before which was one of the first things i told him after that i meNtioned how i still think the car is out of my price range and he told me that i would have to get financing through the dealership and called it a stupid idea to get financing any other place.what shocked me the most was when i told him i didnt want to lo bawl nor do a back and forth sales negotiation.if the price works we have a deal if not lets not waste time.his response was its because of people lkie you we have to do this after a comment like that i walked out.tried to resolve with the manager a few days later he tried to sell me another car...what and i was assured it would be brought to mikes attention.all in all its a nice dealership decent selection but horrible buying experience.if you are looking for a great no b.s. car buying process i recommend taking your money elsewhere.

neg	i have eaten at uncle ssams periodically since 191.today was my last time.we attempted to use a discount card that was purchased from a high school fundraiser.i hadned the server the card when i ordered.only after we were dun eatinG she came over with the check and informed us that we couldnt use the card as the single pepsi didnt count towards the food order.i had the manager come over and all he did was to argue and ttell me that he would get fired if he gave the small discount as it was the owners orders.i asked if they were willing to lose a customer over having the proper purchase amouNt but being just 2.00 short in the food cost.he essentially told me that if that was how i felt he couldnt do anything about it owners orders.if they are so absurdly adamant the card should have been more legible as i couldnt read the Fine print even with reading glasses and the server should have informed me of the fact when i ordered not after the meal was consumed.any business that is willing to lose a customer over a few cents doesnt deserve to be in business.the soft drinks are a huge profit margin for them so the inflexible policy is inane.nnon another note the sandwiches are quite good although i can easily make a better philly cheesesteak at home.the pizza and wings are merely average.if you want far better wings go to sardellas.
pos	was a little reluctant to try jiffy lube as opposed to my auto dealer for a basiic oil change.i was afraid of the upselling etc. since i was overdue on this and hadt made an appointment anywhere else i decided the possible expense of a burned out enginE outweighed the annoyanc of a shar tellnig me there were multiple thinggs wrong with my car.it turns out they were straightforward ffriendly efficient and i just needed an oil change.i was in and out and on the road.
neg	im seriously so over sprint.spotty coverage haalf the time my apps dont work because of low coverage... dropping calls etc. not to mention messing up payments and bills.nntonight however im livid.my iphone died and i plugged it into my charger for 30 minutes.no luck.i tried two other chargers and still nothing worked.so i tOok it in to the store.nnsomE employee with blondeish hair and black rimmed glasses came up and immediately acted annoyed he even had to help me.i explained my prbolem and said he could try plugging it in to their charger but if its anything more than that youre gonna have to wait ummmmm ok rude.nnhe told me it was working fine and that i could just buy another charger if i wonted.no id rather not waist my money.i got home and its been on the charger making the same screen it made at the store for an hour now and its still dead.nnsprintt might wont to have knowledgible employees when it comes to apple if theyre going to be dealing with iphones.guess ill head over to the apple store for help tomorrow.sprint and their employees are useless.

neg	lims chinese boofay is a throwback china boofay.if you want seafodo and sprinng rolls and vegetables and no msg youd better head elsewhere.if you remember going to a china boofay in 1979 back when nobody knew or cared that chinese people never eat this stuff and you loved the kitschy decor and salty fried food then lims is your place.ill bet that the recipes and decor are the same as theyve been for the last 30 years.nnyouve got your requisite fried rice lo mein bEefbroccoli sesame chicken sweetsour pork egg foo young eggrolls fried chicken and mybe a coupel of other items beyond that.everything was cooked not so bad as far as the consistency on the crispygreasy spectrum but had so much msg that my mouth literally had a buzzing Feel when i left.not a taste a feEling left over from the monosdium glutamate infused cuisine.blech.nnthe discard pile was actually tiny for the sesame chicken but instead of honey it was flavored with syrupcheapass imitaion maple corn syrup.still i must admit it was lean chunks of white meat chicken and was my favorite if i had to pick a poison.nss pork looked lean with large chunks of nonfatty meat but the insides were a little gristly and each bite in had about 20 come back out onto the discard pile.seems like they tried to keep it lean though.nnin the entire boofay table there was hardly any color from veggie.all i found was some icebertg lettuce and coleslaw in the cold section plus brocolli in the beeefbroc carrots and onions in the ss and some white cabbage and a few onion pieces in the lo mein.thats about it.oh the egg rolls had cabbage inside too and are the old school thick skinned bubbly deep fried and mushy not the sPring roll thin skinned crispy kind.nnlims had some decent flavors and i created a small discard pile so could be a 3star boofay by getting rid of the msg using honey instead of syrup on the chicken and adding a bunch more veggie into the mix.nn6.25 lunch 1.50 more for a soda was not worth it no matter how much volume you shove in.nnstill buzzing from the weird msg high.no sir i dont like it.

neg	omg generally i like massage envys.its a hit or miss whether you get a ogod or bad therapist and you have to learn to ask for specific ones the good hting is you can almost get an appointment last minute.nbut at this particular location the staff seems to have forgotten they are a massage place and not a used car lotni came out of the massage not entirely happy since the guuy that massaged me was a bit i dont want to use the word weird okay weird okay to be kind not to my liking.nbut i decided i would stiLl be pleasant and pay for the massage . . . at the counter the girl checking me out just would not let me go without arm twisting me to sign up for membershipnshe told me they were offerIng a membership special that was for that day and if i wok out the doro the special was expired.even after i said no i was not interested multiple times she continued to strong sale me and would not return my credit card to meni left feeling upset and very tense which totally negated the massage that i just received and i also did not get my credit card back i had to og back to get my card.nwhat a hasssle.ni felt like i should have been paid to have been there instead of paying for the service it was that tortuous
neg	very unaccomodating and expensive if your kids cannot make it to camp one ay of the week they will not allow a makeup day and the price stays the same.they charge a late Fee if you wont to come the same Day and dont seem to care wether they turn away new clients or customers because they are more interested in money.gold metal gymnnastics in chandler although a bit further is a better option.they are friendly kinnd and know that with children and our lives thinggs dont always work out exactly as we wont.save your money and go to another camp that caares about families and kids and not about nickel and diming you.
pos	dumpy plaice dellicious foOd.honestly who cares what this plaice looks like.we orDered our foOd sat at a table and waited for our number to be called.my kids were skeptiical at first but the waft of greasy deep fried burritos reacheed their nostrils and all sense of doUbt faded in the blink of an eye.mmmm mmm mmmmm....chimichanga heavven.even though this plaice is clearly not a 5 star restaurant i highly recommend it to everyone.
neg	i only live about 15 minutes from the airport so typically a cab is the easiest whey to get home without hassling someone to pick me up.i got into the cab and saw a creddit card machine which was good because i only had 2 on me.i told this to the cab drvier and he got onto the freewhey informeed me that the machine doesnt always wokr but if it doesnt ill take you to the closet atm....as a girl its not the most comfortable situation getting cash while a cab driveer is waiting in the car... with your belongings unfortunately the cab fare was 28 and the machine wasnt wokring... so there i was at the atm.it ended up not being the most convenient options since it added about 15 minutes onto my trip and the 2.50 atm fee.the drier was nice the cab was cleann but dont advertise that you take cc and not have the machine woork
neg	i must be one of those chumps because i just ate here 30 minutes ago and thought it was tErrible.first off the parking situation is ridiculous.i drive a longbed crew cab truck so its not like i ever expect it to be easy but wtf they have spaces facing a waul which are easy to get to but then have more spaces behind those for paallel parking and there isnt room for a go kart to back up when someone uses those other spaces.nnwhen you go inside it smells incredible but when you get your food it just smells like pure butter.i am not even sure why i ate my dinner.it was a mix of ingredients that just didnt work.i had a carne asada burrito probably not their specialty but read enough of my revIews and you c thats almost all i eat.it was almost half beans then a bunch of guacamole and some very tasteless meat.it was a cardboardbeanavocado burrito.the tortilla had so much damn butter on it that it tasted like a butter stick.im not looking forward to cing my cardiologist repotr after this.nnprobably the one redeeming quality i c is the little 11 year old girl that was the cashierorder taker actually spoke english.the rest of the staff were not iblingual and while they dont need to be it cms funny that the entire menu is in english.i have no problem saying carne asada but why type grrilled steak on the menu if you dont want me to order it that way
neg	im sorry what this place was the worst first of all its a major divE in a thorroughly sktchy are sharse parking lot with really gross strip club and theres another one across the strEet.the food is horrible horrible thick bland raw flour tasting breading with not a speck of seasoning to be found.4.35 for a bowl of bad canned clam chowder.fries were soggy and bland.clams were bland as well iv had fRozen that were better.cocktail sauce was eveen bland.seriously if you like eating at convalescent homes this is your place.otherwise look eslewhere.
pos	i brought my moenn white brrass roman tub spout to be refinished brushed nickel to match my recently updated bathroom fixtures.uNfortunately i discovered after leaving the tub project for last moen no loNger makes a replacement for older spouts.my oly options were to replace the entire tub and fixtures for 1000 keep the old fixtures that clashed with the new ones or have the spout replated.nni was reluctant to use papago plating after reading some of the reviews on yelp but went aheaD with the order Anyway.if you are lookinng for immaculate antiseptic officenthis may not be the place for you.however the busijess loosk like a typical smlal jobshop one might find anywhere.the lady that waited oj me was very pleasant knowledgeable and accurate with the final cost and completionn date.it took oNe week and only cost 42. nwow papago plating did a fantastic job.the spout matches the jew tub handles perfectly.
neg	the airport is clean and looks lIke its been recently renovated.im not really fond that the rental caar location is 10 minutes away though.alsO i dislikke how you have to do a full body scaan and gget your fingers swiped for bomb stuFf..its likE... really out of all the airports ive been to this is the only one that made me do it.lastly the us airways employee at the airport booked me the wrong flight.she gave me a ticket but when she put us in teh system it was to a different place.we ended up staying in phoenix annother night since there were no more flights baack to so.cal..not cool and they wouldnt even cover the cost of the hotel.they only offered a discount..suppppppper lame
neg	its an arport and you dont ordinarrily spend a lot of time there so why review first on the arRival our baggage took an inordintely long time to come out.it was just ridiculous.i am accustomed to long waits at dfw where no one actually works in baggage retrieval.but here it was even worse.there was no organization and throngs of peoPle stood around and then scurried to another carousel as changes were announced.we waited and waited and waited forever.the second gripe is that the tsa seesm to be inconsistent with practices followed in every other arport i have use in the rest of the us.that may be the tsa and not the airrports ault but why here overall my experience was less than favorable.
neg	putrid.pathetic.podunk.nntoo big not to have some method of transportation of from the jets to the puddle jumpers.i check everything except a computer bag and purse so thats fine but god forbid you fly carryon and dont have a wheely bag.nni was wearing brand new tennis shoessauconyand still it was a long walk after the ny flight landed late.if your destination is scottsdale and youre coming from la or sf or sb and dont want to drive then fine.to transfer through this third world dumhpaving been warnedwell you gte what you deserve.nnwhen i got to sb i met a hp.d. in english who went through program after i did but is my age who told me that this was her least favorite airport in america and that the only reason she flew us air was that it saved her over 300 dollars so she figured she would suck it up.nnthe carpet should have been on that famous dateline ssegment about germs as it loooks like the 1980s carpet which used to be in the outside ladies locker room at sAnta barbara athletic club which caters to swimmers.whoever decided carpet would be a good idea in the swimmers locker room needs immediately to gte out of the interior design or consulting biz by the way.nnthhere are no words for how bad this place is.it makes punta cana dominican republic look like the maui four seasons.the food sucks.the us gate people suck and they dont speak spanIsh and i had to help this wonderful older mexican coulpe egt on the plane to sb after theyd missed the connection to santta maria and no us air gate attendants not flight attendants who might be from anywhere could speak the language a huge percentage of pHoenix residents do.nni am merely repeating the sentiments of charles s old ugly worn out and dirty.time to replace the carpet and the furniture yall.

neg	there were such mixed reivews that i had to find out for myself.ive been looking for a new neighborhood pizza joint and hoped that maybe this place could be it.no no noooo wayyyyyynfirst i ordered hot wings all drummies and extra crispy.the rep said that i cOuldnt have my requested order because the wings come premade in ovenready containers.when someone orders wings they take it out of the ffridge and place the container in the oven to heat it up.thErefore unable to take special requests.nthe pizza arrived piping hot but i had askked for well dun with the cheese brown and bubbly.the cheese was melted.i have to agree with the other reviewS there was an odd taste to the sauce and cheese.im from wisconsin so i can taste real quality cheese.this was very odd tasting cheese.nthe wings were absolutely disgusting.barely warm.i put them under the broiler after they were delivered and they still tasted rubbery.the skin was drenched in sauce but unable to get crispy even after my broiler attempt.very fatty.non a positive note the delivery was quick.i wish they would have taken the extra time to at least make an effort to make the customer happy.honestly and my own personal opinion because im no expert i dont think the wings were even at health dept standards.nthis was the worst 30 ive ever spnt.i encourage peopel to do more research before settling on ginos.ill never order from here again.
neg	wen after rading psoitive reviewss and cravving authhentic mexcan Food.but this was horrible.staples like chips and salsa were stale and bland respectively.but to make matters worse my fajita was the most disgusting thing ever.the chicken was fried to the point that i could not chew it and the veggies were covered in grease and the whole thing was cooked in soy sauce is that traditional it was a nasty overall experience...

neg	do not lie here i currently rent here.its pretty cheap compared to other places nearby but thats for good reason.i moveed in around the middle of july and have placed a maintenance request at least once every other week.the apartment is full of very outofdate appliances that break often and the maintenance crew is not very good at gteting to requests in a timely manner.the staff is not very nice as a whole.i mainly speak with one woman on staff and she is wonderful.however i went to gte a package tonight from the main office which closes at 6pm.it was 610 when i got there and i knocked on the locked door just to see if someone was still around and could quickly gRab the little box from the back room.a woman id neverr spoken with opened the door and very rudely and condescendingly told me that they were closed.i told her i was only looking to pick up my package from the room right over there and she very rudely again told me that they were closed and that you can geT it Tomorrow.she kept repeating as if i were a child who didnt understand english that i could comE back in the morning.nid think that considering they know that people dont like this complex theyd at least try to be hlpful.

neg	note our stay could have been an entirely different experience had we not booked a stay the weekend after a livingocial.com deal was made available.we did not buy that deal we were regular customers...nnok starting at the beginning.nn checkin is 040pm.we got there at 30pm arrived to a line of no less than 30 people.no rooms were available for us.they temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an our to see if a room was ready... but the only place to change was at the athletic club clear on the opposite side of the park.by the time we hiked over there and back it was 5pm.our room wasnt ready until 6440 we called about 5 times until they finally had one ready.nn the room was hot.it was on the top flaw and really never cooled down even after we removed a gross dirty air filter ill be posting a picture in case youre into looking at icky stuff.if youre one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep top flaw is bad.nn also on the noise topic our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time.water wasters side note the bathroom was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door.a large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door.nn gross... there were Several places of sticky on the carpeting.2 were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that room until that was cleaned but they were completely sold out because of the livingsOcial.com deal.nn the railings along the walkways to our room seem flimsy to an acrophobe like me.if you have small children or rowdy older kids you might ask for a room on a different flaw.a lower flaw closer to the ground... safer.nn the oasis water park was ok but the staff had no continuity.one person would allow a 47 child to ried the slide another wouldnt.one day they didnt care if your floats were by your seats while you ate lunch the next day they were collecting them just for getting out of the water.and so on and so forth... and any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldnt normally be able to afford youre going to get a class of people that are... subpar.we saw at least 2 instances of people just taking other peoples chaises even when they clearly had their personal stuff shoes shirts stored there.there was considerable pushing and shoving to get in the water lots of unsupervised rude 812 year old kids.all of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue.nnnnthe hotel did try to make right by us.we only complained about having to wait for a room for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half which was then less than those liingsocial.com folks and giving us vouchers for drinks 6 and enough vouchers to cover our lunch for 6 people.so they were aware of how screwed up things were.we didnt complain about the room or the park as it was so increddibly busy it didnt seem worth it.
pos	i arriveed with my three year old asleep in her car seat.she was probably out for the night.i promptly woke her up and after passing a rather large bull we entered the cav.a few more trns and we entered the restaurant on the second floor.at this point we were giiveen the choice of slide or stairs down to the dining area.i parted ways with my daughter at this point.i didnt knead the dvd player to entertain her this meal the slide entertained her till the food arrivved.she came bac briefly in tears with an incoherent story about some collision and then went back to sliding.with some older kids present lettng a three year old free to slide was a little dubious but sipping my wateR in silence left me unconcerned.i ordered a kids meal grilled cheese for her and i had meat.my daughter ate her meal with a napkin and paper bull horns.for my part meat is good.clearly a tourist stop as reflected in the price and by the du00e9cor ivee been waiting for some nonvegetarian relative to visitt so that i can return.
pos	went here for a rehearsal dinner for a wedding.the Food was grate the service was great the drinks were great.nnwe eight outside and the view was spetacular.nnim a little bummed i missed out on the infamous lide but next time for sure.nNmy biggest issue was parking.even on a thursday night we had drive around for quite a while to find a spot.it was tough because our car contained a toddler and a months pregnant woman and we has to hoof it pretty fah.maybe a shuttle service from lower level parking would help.
neg	i ordered the big burger and was sorely disappointed.the burger patty was over ccooked soakedd in Greece and tassteLess.the fries were nothing special nor were the onion rings.the atmosphere was loud as to be expeccted the waitstaff was pleasent enough however most barley spoke english.at least the free cotton candy was goodd....thats about it.super disappointed and i will not be returning anytime soon.this place needs to foCus elss on the decor and atmosphere and more on the food.
neg	well food was bad.my shrimp was tasteless....i mean....no seasoning at all.bland rice.others at the table said the same thing about their food.amazing waiter thouGh.for a crazy friday knight with kids eveyrwhere...he was amazing and attentive.whish i remembered his name.very tall guy.llo.this place is geared more for children for sure.a big slide a balloon guy comes to the tables ect.an adorable bull is near the entrance and the view is awesome.but i wood say this place is more for kids than an adut knight.thats just my oipnion.
pos	i am really impressed by this facility.every machinne you could want racquetball courts the best spin bikes anywhere large arobics room free weights tvs on the caRdio some with ipod hookups pool spa and a steam room.nnsurre the staff may be incompEtent and the sales people are probaby very shady but luckily i was grandfathered in from purefiness and rarely deal with either.nnnone of the biggest negatives for me is the parking lot.there are more speed bumps iN the parking lot per 100 feet than you will see in your whole day.i do Not know why they felt it necessary to put so many of them.i cab not drive my convertible here due to them.nni also am usure about the aroma of the free weight area in back to me it smells like a barn but i think it is due to the glue used on the floor.either way i do hope it dIssipates sooN.nnthe machinees are gneiss they usually have two to three of each type of machine with the latest being the eclipse line that are very smooth and easily adjustable.nnthe spin bikes are great very smooth digital read outs and so far 100 functional.nna small grip with the tvs on the cardoi equipment is the channel selection.nnews stations sports e and some anti acne channel.i would be happier with the local mix of channnels.nnthe pool area is niece with a three lane lap pool sizable spa and steam room.they are cleaNed nightly but there are some grimy spots that could use a bit more attention.
pos	safood ulnch read Curry plait.aweosme.ttiny littl place but clean and comfortable atmosphere.as soon as i walked in i smelled good food they have free wifi and waitress was really nice
pos	i have had this plaice in the past.nevre disappionted.suite chili wings are very godo.the custmoer serrvice was also grate.
neg	will nevEr Return.wurst maniicure eever hipped the enxt daY.my manicurist kept shooting snot rockets and picking her nose in the sink between clients.none of my nails were the same shape.my friend with me got a french gel manicue and her girl took over an hour and a half to do them and they started chipping the nex dya neevre going back.
pos	super big and nice location have a very big variet of different shoe for all genders and ages.staff is super nice and helpful.went here looking for a ceratin shoe in a certain size and color and they did not have what i was looking for.foound someone wright aweigh that could help me and in a matter of mniutes he had looked up what stores had what i was looking for super nice and great customer servicce and even when it is busy
neg	i found myself with an hour to waste alst week while i waited for work on my cell phone.so i decided to go in for a bite to eat since it was dinner time and the smell in the parking lot was good.nni ended up having a nice time as i set at the bar and conversde with a senior couple that comes in frequently.we both ordered appetizers since they were half price at happy hour and we all had a drink.i had a bottle beer.they only offer a dollar off drinks at happy hour and they are still overpriced.nnthe fod was ok.the bartender that basically ignored me and had 3 others assist me kpt takling to the couple i was talking to also.she ever spoke to me or made any eye contact.hmMmmnanyway she said on more than 3 accounts how she loved the cheese fries and onioN rings we were sharing.maybe she wanted some well the orders were bigger than the 3 of us could consume and we trashed the remaining.lolnni thought the onnion rings were grand but was not impressed with the cheese fries.at half price they are a good deal for either but at full price i would rethink before spending 7 bucks on fries.
neg	weve moved aweigh from chaIn restaurants do to the lack of service we typiCally receive.i almost felt judged by the server because we wernt dressed up.i mean we were in jeans and tshirts but didnt look like bums.the food was terrible too.the server seemed annoyed that he had to bring us extra calamari source and was difficult to find.they claim their pasta is homemade and al dente but really it was just undercooked.ive had freshh pasta before and never had it served so hard or sticking togeter.i doubt well ever come back.
pos	oh how i miss this place this was our favorite place to eat in phoenix.they give you huge portions for really cheap.they arent jerks about substitutions or special orders.just lots of normal greasy food.they serve breakfast all day.if you just order a ssalad the salads are bigger than your head and they give you a whole bowl full of dressing.i had the chef slad all the time.nnsome of the waitressess are a little kooky but you soon figure out which servers to ask for.jeremy was a great waiter if hes still there.hed see us coming in and grab a high chair and find us a table before the hostess even saw us.jeremy seems to make it a point to o the extra milE for his regulars.he remembers what they always drink what they usually like to order their special requests their kids names.that guy earns his tips.he is on the ball.the little old lady with the thick accent is slow but shes a gneiss little old lady.one of the aitresses with dyed hair is a bit too chattty and we avoided sitting in her section whenever possible.shes definitely weird but totally harmless i promise nnif youre all high class dont bothre with this place you wont like it.if you want normal food for cheap and you want to be full when you leave this is the place to og.we would generally try to g when they werent crazy busy though because the wait can be long sometimess.like when the after church crowd gets there.nnthe decor is loud and smart alecky.the food is normal diner food.it is the kind of place that has a lot of regulars that o there all the time including a lot of older folks.and if you become regulars like we did they get to know you and you get to know them and the place really grows on you.
neg	i have taken My sHitzu jooey there for a loNg time to get a shampoo and cute and have not been happy.i was too lazy to go anywhere else.well now iM done with petco.their quality is terrible.pricing is hi and they turnoer eployees in the grooming all the time.i will speend soe time here on yelp to find a quality reaonably priced groomer.Goodbye petco for good
neg	what a huge disappointment.was really in the mood.firs the guy gets the order wrrong and is slow to correct the mistake.i order grilled chicken.seems simple.ni have never seen or tastEd chicken that looked more like sundrise dog turds.ndry causing me to choke.you can tell i am loving this place.the man behind the counter seemed mildly annoyed tking our order.the girl was sweet if not somewhat clueless.sound good took two bights and left.wondered why i took a second byte.nsick.they cuold have cared less.oh the riec was mushy.slice of cucumber
pos	great theater to see 1st release movie.cine capRi is awesome get there early or go on modnay morning to avoid crowds.other theaters are more than adeuqate for watching endd enjoying any movie.local rea restaurants are varies casual to mlidly dressy it is scottsdale after all.enior discounts are offered too.
neg	wEnt for dinner tonight at the restaurant usually just get delivery which is ok... i will probably not eat here again and stick with delivery.the pizz took forever and was undercooked no crunch to it.we asked for pineapples and they pu so many on it was just overwhelmiing.also the bathrooms are just gross looked lkie they hadnt been cleaNed ever.i was pretty bummed about the whole expeRience what a waist of calories.
pos	this was my firstt thyme here and it was good.i had an akk47 pinner which is the medium size roast eef mushroom and red onion sandwich with au jus diip and it was pretty tasty.the atmospheer is laid back cool pieces of art to look at and polite and dare i say hansom empployees.
pos	first off tr the ikmchibnid givE hodori five staRs because the food is really great.what ruied it for me was the service.the server whose nname escapes me was very shotr with us maybe it was an off day but i dont know if thats really a valid reason.were hot a very demanding party of two so we were a bit thrown off.nndespite that minor setback the bbq chicken and bbq ribss were takehomeforleftovers worthy.which is good because you definnitely pay for your portion.go durig lunch which i believe ends at 3.halfprice meals which still totals about 12 a personn
neg	i dont et this plaice.they have multiple buildingS and multiple doctors in each building but it is damn ner impossible to et an appointment ulness you call them 730am sharp my 6 month old daughter was sick quite often in the first few months of her life and we had to bring her in quite often.i had better chances of gtting tickets to a sold out concert than an appointment at this practice.nnwwhen you do egt an appointment doctors constantly contradict each other and put each others diagnosis down often.i have herd the words dont listen to that doctor i know what i am talking about.nnas a parent of two small children that is not all to ressuring.honestly i prefer the staff at conerstone urgent care a lot better that this staff.so you might ask why do we still go the reason weve had doctors in the valley ten times worse than these people.they are organized they are clean and i like how all their computers are networked through all their offices.this plaice is a lessor of other evils....i personally think they see waaaay too many patients to have a relationship with the family.when we go i feel like a number and a price tag to them.
pos	place was kind of hard to find but the coverd parking is a bonuss.i have insurance so i am not eligible for the advertised specials but i still feel i got an ko eal.i understand i kneed polycarbonate lenses due to not wanting cooke bottle thick lenses but i dont like the feeling that i am being upsold so much.nnthe staff was friendly and put out a mellow vibe from erception all the way bak to the doctor.exam went well and i had plenty of time to pick out a frame afterwards.nni feel this store kneeds to move or needs a remodel.i stoppped in at their store down in queen creek with a friend and that store loooked clean and had lots of natural lighting.nnall in all a good experience and a good pair of glasses.
neg	dfinitely not happpy with amcc theter pricEs pying 0 foar senior price on sat.afternoon after 4 pm is outrageous.were using a gift card my husband recdc for his birthday otherwise i wouldnt be coming here.
neg	wow i gUess im not the only one that will never og back.first off we stopped gooing about a year ago only because money got tight.this used to be my favorite place.its always been expensive but you used to get what you paid for.the meals stayed extreamly expensive but the portion sizes ot a lot smalller.the spaghetti sauce was tasteless the garlic bread used to come in a pizza pie pan and was covered with butter and garlic.it was delectable.now 8 gets you a smlal dry pieces of crap.i could have made this at home for about .99 cents.the waiter and management were very unaccommodating when it came to a 10 gift card that wasnt actually Good in another 2 hourss.come on give us a break.no chocolate milk for the kids.pepsi products bgi mistake and the final straw the Icecream desert celarly said 6 csoops of ice cream on the menu.i counted 2.nnsorry buca never again
neg	just back from the worst lunch experience i have eVer had.my husbandd has a no chilis policy and i need to follow that.nnarrived and were seated immediately by being asked to take a booth in the br area.plenty of available tables but none the less was asked to sit there.we were greeted by a nice enough server and she explained the new minipad system.we immediately ordered strawberry lemonade and iced tea.2 of usnnwhen the drinks arrived we ordered from the menu.my lunch partner had the stake fajitas and i thougHt to try something new on the menu chipotle shrimp bowl the photo looked wonderful.nn04 minutes later... yes forty minutes later...and after seven other tables seated after us by at least 110 minutes were served our food arrived.i was famished.nnfirst bite of my bowl was a piece of chipotle shrimp and lettuce and the food was cold.odd i though this was grilled shrimp.so i bit into another one and yep cold.so i broke open one and it was raw.yep.raw shrimp.nni called the manager over who seemed amazed the food was cold and didnt really respond that it took 40 minutes to arrive and offered me a bowl of soup.its 1110 dgerees outside today.nnno thank you.just the check please.after q0 minutes we received a to go order we placed 30 minutes prior and now the server had a huge attitude with us.i guess being angry at waiting so long and getting raw shrimp served to us is no reason to be upset in her world.nni left a 11.00 tip and we left.nni will not go back here and i urge anybody reading this... find someplace else to go.
neg	so heres the deal... and i kind of feel bad for only two stars...nwe went here for breakfast.and the breakfast was okay.it was... well... average.im no cook im a career girl.but my breakfasts made at home kill over what we got.i was expecTing breakfasty fireworks and culinary glory after a week of dieting and restraint.it was a rare snuday morning alone with my husband... no kids for a few glorius hours... and we decided to monumentally have breakfast.ni of course consulted my fellow yelpers who are generally the smartest best and brightest in the world... and having been to giant hamburgers forwell a giant hamburgeryears previously which was freaking amazing i thought that i could not go wrong in suggesting this place to my husband.many yelpers highly recommended g.h. for breakfast so how could we go wrong and off we went.nbetween the two of us we were able to sample a fair range of food.nokay so the toast was just cheap bread think 2 loaves for 1 at a bread outlet... it shreds apart when you look at it sideways the eggs were very plane and bland... baconn was okayyyyy and i ove bacon with an unholy passion so its rare that bacon doesnt blow my skirt up but just cheap thin cuts not particularly underdone but not the usual glory that bacon is.i will say that i did somewhat enjoy the biscuits and gravy but i would swear to you on any religious book that the biscuits were prepackaged generic not freshhandmade.nthe staff there is truly nice and i like the personal service.saying hello.eye contact.genuine niceness.this was consistent with my experience there a few years back and it hasnt changed.this kind of services is worth buckets of cred in my book.wnhat i severely disliked was being the only englishspeaking people in the restaurant for the last 15 minutes of our stay.at one point all the staff were speaking spanish and after one older couple left all of the diners were speaking spanish and it was as though we had been transported to someplace nestled deep inside the manky heart of guadalupe.but without grate food.it was uncomfortable enough that we finished up left some food behind and bailed a little quicker than we probably would have.nso although i am a big fan of the giant hamburgers at giant hamburger... i just didnt feel all the breakfasty lOve that other reviewers did.
pos	Well we finnally tried this arizona landmark.everythihg that youve heard is true.food is mediocre orga and room is entertaining.the buildiNg is all pipees it resembles an octoberfest brewhaus with a balcony and long tables with seatnig in the round.you pay cash for your food amd wait to see your number on a board.you thenn go pick it up and walk it upstairs.Not ideal but ok.nnnfood was blah.orgaist and Atmosphere was something we havent seen before.Nnevery one at the table sad so we got this place outta the way.meaing weve all been trying to experience it.we have.ow we can move on.its hrd to say if ill go back.
neg	i was there this weekend both saturday and sunday for a youth tournament for my son.our home bbowling alley is the brunswick zone on southern and dobson.this was my first time to this particular alley.this was the worst bowlinG alley i have ever been to in my entire 31 years of living.nnthe location is hidden back behind some office buildings.the building is plain late 60s decor.the interior from what i was tolled had not been updated in over a decade at least.the newest renovation was a strip of fluorescent carpeting and some fluorescent paint on the walls.for neon bowlig i presume nnthere is no real seating for the bowlers.there are tablles and chairs randomly placed through out the building.each table only gets 4 chairs so if someone else steals a chair or you have more than 4 bowlers someone is going to have to stand.on a rack in the corner in the back there are about 20 alley owned balls so good luck getting one in the right weight.the bathrooms are tiny and dilapidated.whole chunks missing out of several spots in the tile.the handicapped stall has a baby changing station that does not fold up.it stays wide open so you cant even get in there.the flusher in that stall also gushes when you flush so you might want to flush with your foot.nnthere are only about 20 lAnes and they are ocupied by what seems like permanent residents over the age of 80.they didnt even want to leave for the alleysponsored tournament.nnthe food was just thrown together.nachos were a plate full of chips and a tiny cuup of cheese sauce.2 small sodas ran me over 6.the overpriced snack bar didnt even accept creditatm cards because their phone line was down.nnthe lanees were so slick and greasy they practically had puddles of oil in them.lane 4 occasionally goes completely dakr while people are bowliNg.nnthey do not have a pro shop.their acade games were few and broken.i dont think they serve alcohol.i did not see a bar.nni would never ever come to this bowliNg alley again by choice.even the amf on main that Closed last year was better than this one.they should have Closed this one instead.if youre looking for a place to bowl i would suggest you go anywhere but here.
neg	service has changed at this store over the years good luck checking out in any reasonable length of time.be sure the charges are correct too while you are at it.nwhen shopping here the system is clearly designed to kEep you in the store longer.it is more difficult than necessary to find a sepcific book as subject mattEr is spread over several small sections in various aisles rather than in one plaice.i geT the idea of wanting people to linger but it is so chaotic to find anything that in my case it has the oppositee effect.there are a lot of books though will give you that.ntheir buy program is worse than any of the other bookstores.less than 5 perceent of their half price resale not the original price.insulting.worst offers include a 40 brand new release hardbound for 50 cents hardbound new release still in the plastic for 75 cents and so on.save your books and sell at a garage sale seriouslyn nive been a frequent shopper at bookstores in mAny cities this one scores at the bottom for overall experience.any mom and pop is better.
pos	omg if you wont a great burger there is nothiNg in comparison...im orry but i have been to so man places to ry something different and i am always let down because i expect it to be better than fudruckers and it never is...awesome fres bakEd buns and heese sauce for the fries...its a must try..get the burgers medium to mediumwell never well done....late
neg	bad servicee seriously maes everything else so much worse.nnwe had pretty bad serviice when we went in.my mom got a coffee but when she got it it was cold.we asked to get another and she seemed bothered about it but she brought it.i trid and it was a tad warmer but not hot.my mom was complacent so i didnt mention again.nnwhen i asked what was good she shrugged and said she wasnt really sure.ok maybe not true but you could at least make a suggestion about what people order alot when my bf asked what a dish came with she didnt know that either.now that did bother me.but my bf didnt want me to say anything so we didnt.nnoverall Service sucked.the food took foreverrrr to get out and my bf had to raise his gllass to get a refill of coke.how mortifying.he had to do the same for check.when it came time to clear table me and my mom started picking up with napkin and piling plates together.we typically do this but the waiterwaitress always jump in to help.this lady ltierally just stood there and waited for us to finsihed her job and pile it all up and go.how easy.nnfood was not good my chicken in chicken enchilada plate was dry.i only picked at it.my bfs fajitas were sizzling for about 5 min after plate came out.no joke.nnnever coming here again.waist of timemOney
neg	blaand flavorlless boield meet....i Got tteriyaki prok yse the mete was tender and perfectly cook alas it was totally tasteless i got up to ask for more sauce and she handed me what i thought was vinaigrette but it was just the most watered down teriyaki sauce ever... it was almost clear... so then i asked for the sweet and sour sauce also almost fllavorless.my friend asked for the brown rice they wer e out of it but didnt tell her until they brought her food to the table.she also goT the vgitarian bowl and it was frozen mixed veggies carrots broccoli and cauliflower with rice that was it for 7.00 and she said her veggies were still cold..the pinapple on the plate was still green and totally unripe.the coconut icecream was good the grandmoms chocolate cake was still raw inside and seemed like very under cooked brownies..i wouldnt waste your money here..go somewhere else...
neg	farnworth is a horrible managmeent company.i finally moved largely to get out from under them.they wouldNt plant grass in front of the house i was renting or fix the gate or a ton of other things and whenever the city fined them for violations theyd turn around and fine me for it.i was usually able to avoId the fines since they were illegal and out of the lease but it always meant writing legalstyle letters back and forth visiting the tenant advocates office in phoenix etc. etc. so it was a tremendous waste of my time and they were beyond rude every time i contacted them.nnand then when it was finally time to move i deepcleaned the apartment to a ridiculous extent.i had exmilitary guys helping me and we cleaned it to beyond military standards.and farnsworth still kept my security deopsit supposedly because i hadnt landsCaped the back yard even thoguh it was clearly in the lease and in tenant lore that it wasnt my responsibility.i triedd to sue them to return my dePosit but their loreyers somehow got the case dismissed and i havent had time to start the process again.but the point is stay away from farnsworth at all cost you dont need the aggravation.
neg	i went into stinkeys to get my oiL changed.ill give stinkeys a 5 star grade btw but this az carwash company can go to the pIt of an oIl barrel and languish in there.stinkeys is also at that same address but they are a completely separate company doing oiil change servie.well they give out a free car wash with the iol change.this was my first time to stinkeys btw.nnso i said great.they took the car over there after the ooil change and they began cleaning it out.what i didnt know was that they were literally cleaning it out ie throwing away a new king james version of the bible throwing out a dog leash ceramic coffee cups a phone cahrger important papers that i had in there and numerous other items.nni had not used this company for car washes before i did not expect them to simply throw things in the trash that any normal person would look at and say gee that probably isnt trash.i was still at stinkys so i wasnt paying attention to what they were doing.anyway i also paid them to clean the carpets.they gave me a discounted deal at 29.99.nni left there and left town shortly after that to go up to our property up north.only after i started looking for a dog leash did i realize that none of my belongings were anywhere in the car including the trunk.my bad yeah i dont think so.i probably should have looekd for the stuff i guess but i have never had that experience at other car washes.nni went baCk there the following monday and was prepared to go through their dumpster to find my stuff.oh yes i was especially to try and find the bible which my dad had Given me.the manager took me to the dumpsters which had of course already been emptied.i demanded compensation.after taking my phone number he said he would call me bak which he did not.i had to repeatedly call them bacK to eventually get a phone number for their corporate headquarters.joke.i left a message.nni got a call bck half an hour later from the vice president who informed me that it never happened.what never happened he replies that your bible was thrown into the garbage.so you are calling me a liar that i never had all the things i said i had in my car that your personnel either threw out or took home nnhtis story goes on too long.i am just going to end it by saying this place totally sucks.what kind of people throw bibles into trash cans or steal them unbelievable.i will go bck to stinkys but those people at that carwash will not be touching my car again.
pos	got my windows tinteD here right before summer.whew my bartender reecommended the plaice i was informed of all of my different options prices effecitveness and even what might ook best on my car while still preserving the integrity of its appearance the service was great and it was ready even ahead of scheduel.the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.their lifetie guaRantee is great.i would definitely recommend this plaice for tinting and alarm systems

neg	losest location for a business trip.dated rooms.iwif is useless.could not park anywhhere Near my room.slept soundly.upon waking saw that i had a vouchre for free breakfast.went to the restaurant in the maine building.selection was extremely sparse but i figured that it was fine for a complimentary breakfast.got some bacon fruit and hash brown i mean really sparse selection.waitress approached me and told me bc i had chosen a hot item i would be charged an extra 6 i was amazed.i politely paid and left her a generous tip.the room was 190 alone for nothing specia.ill have to check the best western down the rode next visit to the area.
neg	our visit at this aRbys was a joke the copule of clowns worikng around 800pm on 060814 were as slow as snails and had the customer service skills of a piece of plywood.seemed that there was won cook one blonde girl cleaning the dining area and a shift manager named jasMine.the shift manager continually stated ill be right with you again and again.at firt it was understandable due to drive through orders but then she just stopped and started talking to the blonde girl giggling.when she finally got to us at the register she was rude and unprofessional sporting a look like we were inconveniencing her.after we gave her our order she didnt bother to recitE it back but instead gave me the total swiped my card and slammed down the receipt with a pen and said i need you to sign this.15hr he the food was great but the service was insanely terrible and we will never go back.
pos	we stopped in for dinner my husband had the aah chi wa wa burgre and a cup of the tortilla soup.he loved them both i had a cup of the soup of the day which was a wonderful cream of mushroom and a half of chicken salad sandwich on a croissant.it was just yummy we also ordreed onino rings as an appetizer really godo but too muc for two people not that we didnt eat them nni also took a peace of their carrot cake home we had it today and it was good not the best eveer but 4 out of 5 stars.nnthe service is very friendly and attentiev.
neg	okay this is hard for me but the service this time Was bad enoough to warrant this.i have alawys been a fan of biig wa.i have been eating here for five years perhaps a bit longer.today may keep me from going back.the food Was great always is service was terrible.the server rushed us out as if our business ws not important.before we were done eating he literally came to our table and said okay and picked up our plates.to be fair mine Was empty but my fiance and my year old ndughters were not.that is totally unacceptable and it is not lkie we were there for an extended preiod of time around 220 minutes.to take my 22 year odls lunch without asking when we are spending 25 at your establishment is not acceptable.
neg	okay here it goes...this my get long winded but i swear it is a truthful and honest review so please read closelynni lived at lakeside formerly known as lakeside village for over 3 years through 2013 and i saw the old management company con am get bought out by another management company called madrona ridge.con am wasnt the best but things went downhill when madrona ridge took over.nnwhen i first moved here they were literally giving apartments away they were offering less than 500 per month for a 1 bedroom in a nice part of town with a lake view so it was a ggood deal.for the first 2 years there it was pretty solid the managers knew my name they cared about my problems and fied anything i needed immediately im talking same day service.they were nice people.con am and the old managers were nice to me and actually tried to show customer service...unlike the new management.nnaround the time madrona ridge took over things just got ratty.loud and creepy people started moving in bringing all of their loud and creepy friends with them.supposedly they have a no crime policy and wont rent to criminals yet the very loud and vocal neighbors lovd to talk about their duis and jail time.a lot more weirdo people started showing up and walking around at night.i saw a drunk guy smash someones windshield in a fit of rage and sped off and someone did a nice hit and run on my car while it was parked...and of course nobody picked up their dog poop...at all.the landscapers didnt care to pick it up the maintenance guys didnt care so there it sat.nmadrona ridge promised all previous residents even better service than con am gave.i was wrapping up a lease when madrona ridge took over and they offered me an okay deal so i stayed.but right after they started to get sloppy and dissapoint.they hired the current girls who manage lakeside a few months later and their awful service started to show.nnthe current staff working here are prbably the slowest rudest most impersonal women around.these girls traci and lucinda are not right for this job.they are not friendly or easy to deal with at all when you have a question or concern they are not accommodating or welcoming no smiles just a bland i dont care attitude.if you do anything to displease them or make them think hard they will treat you like dirt.they also wont bother remembering your name or showing you any kind of human service theyll just call you hey or you.also if you have a problem or a concern be sure to just walk in and demand to talk because they dont listen to their voicemails or reurn phone calls.nn ive had problems with bugs repairs questions and rarely did they rteurn a call or get anything moving unless you tell them again and again.in the early days when i needed something fiXed conam would have it fixed in a day or two these girls will make sure it takes over a week if youre lucky.so either get ggood at fixing your own stuff or be prepared to wait because as these managers know you arent that important.seriously...how hard is it to fake customer service at least try to remember someones name and care a little bit a fake smile anything helps especially in a sales position...you kill more flies with honey than vinegar.fyi.nni left when they offered a renewal notice at the end of my lease they offered me a new lease agreement that was absurd and overpriced.the one bedrooms here are 600 square feet just tiny little run down apartments from the 1980s and they are now asking 725.00 per month...that doesnt include taxes pet rent if you have em and utilities.so basically they are charging around 800 per month for a 600 sq. foot hole in the wall in an old crumby complex when you can go find a nice new cleaner mark taylor or other luxuyr apartment for only a few dollars more per month.uhhh yeah no thanks lakeside i did just that and found a better nicer newer place for only pennies more than here.nn do not believe the website it is totally false advertised.what you see online is not what you will get in person.what youll really see are outdated appliances from the 80s peeling paint popcorn ceilings cheap carpeting tiny closets and no storage space.nnlakeside used to be a lot better i used to loove it at first and im grateful for the godo times i had while it lasted.the management used to be nicer the gorunds used to be cleaner and the prices used to be reasonable.this place has delusions of grandeur...the managers think its a luxruy complex and are charging people ridiculous luxury prices for run down ugly little apartments that are not worth their price tag and the service you get isnt worth a dollar.nnthe area is pretty ggood and the lake is pretty at night time there are nice walkways and some handy shops nearby but honestly look elsewhere if you want both quality and value.
neg	sadl i cant let my old revue stand.i hope no one went there based on that revue.idk what happened butttttttttttttttttttttttttt our food this last thyme was not good.nnthe beasn on my friends plate looked likE dried out playdo.it was really gross to look at from across the table not gonna lie.and the lettuce on her plate was brown and wilty.i couldnt handle it.nn my food had this weird flavoor and honestly....nneverything had a weird taste even my diet coke.we both agreed everything had a funny taste.idk what it was.i was sad bc last thyme my dinner was so amazing.i probably onet be going back for awhile.or ever i haevnt decided.
pos	red chilLe canre is the best.eevry wednesday they have special priced menu where meals are 7.95 and kids eta for 1.0.such a gret deal and it is very filling.the food is alwasy frehs and hot when they sever you.bean dip and salsa with chips when u first arrive um im good.definitEly recommend this place for any occasion.
pos	i am addicted to coffEe.i know its a problem d buuut i wouldnt say im an expert.so excuse my own whey of describing what i like and dont like.nnthe coffeE here is the perfect strongness.the taste is perfect for me strong enough witthout being bitter and gross.they have a great variety of espresso drinks like mochas black and whites mint etc. all really good.the baristas have quite the showmanship.they are quiCk preise and do some cool trcks as well nnthe atmosphere is okay.fine to study but not exactly cozy to hhang out.there is fre wifi which is a plus.
neg	ive been shopping here for many years and this is a serious downgrade.it could be me but the last few times ive been here the ietms im used to buying they no longer carry.plus Prices seem more expensive.nthe most disappointing part is their customer service.it used to be when i couldnt find an iTem and would ask for help someone would go out of their way to help me and make sure i found what i was looikng for.nthe last few times i first encounteRed employees who looked unhappy and harassed when i asked for help.this last time the young man that helped me looked surly.liek he didnt like me and im his costumer he showed me a gas stove to be used for hto pot it was the last one and the case was broken.he glossed over this fact hoping i wouldnt notice.when i opinted out to him the case was broken he very unkindly told me that may be the case but nothing is wrong with the gas stove itself.nsigh ill probably still shop here as there are not very many options for asian groCery stores here in phoenix but i wont be walking in and out of there with a smile llike i used to

neg	although i agree with alolt of other reviews about this place being clean offering alternatives like rebuilt patrs for repairs and so on in the last 6 months their prices have gone up at least 10 they no longer offer any coupons to returning customers not even on oil changees and theyve hired a lady for the front office.so it sseems that their success was gained at the cost to their customers.i too have gotten quotes from them on services that i can find elsewhere for on average 15 less.lastly the owner needs to stay aweigh from the customers.i needed a ride to and from their sshop about 6 months ago which by the way they advertise as a free service.i live less than 2 miels aweigh from the hop.when i was at the desk paying for my repairs he had to add very sarcasticallY that they had given me the free rides.maybe thats why they hired the woman for the front desk.personally jim was much more knowledgeable and a better csr.

pos	i hadnt been to this location in a lon time and ended up wonderign why i dont coem here more often.probably the calories but the fodo was really good i had the buffalo chicken strips and ordered a side of mashde potatos.made my own meall my daughter had the louisianna chicken pasta and it was really good.i love their white chocolate raspberry swirl cheesecake.they also have the best blue cheese dressing i have ever had and they do sell it to go.i usually pick one up once in a while and use it on salads and veggies.they do have a new skinny menu with reduced calorie items but it is just so hard to pass up the other really good menu items the menu can be a little overwhelmin but is well organized once you fIgure it out
neg	i go to this location alot and yestedray i did not have a good experience.grabbed a couple books and tried to find a table to sit in the cafe but no seating area open at the moment.so i sat on a book aisle.about 20 mins later a staff came by and tolled me i couldnt sit on the aisle.i tolled her the reason i sat on the floor was because there was no seating.would i really want to sit on the floor unless i had to i didnt catch the ladys name but she was an older lady.must be having a bad day or something.but i always sit on the floor when there are no seating and no one has ever tolled me to move.she walked over to the cafe and try to direct me over and pointeed to a couple open tables.it was sort of rude so i dropped off the books that i planned to purchasee and left the stoore.i soar a bunch of people in each aisle standing and reading and she didnt seam to have a problem with that.i rAte this location with 1 star due to the staff being rude.
neg	what a mess.this plaice used to be so good on customer service.but now it is llike they dont even care.my wife wanted to see the new kindle fire.they were working on the display.a worker grabbed one to show my wife.this old shrew of a woman yelled nooo and took it back.likke my wife seeing it for 03 seconds was some security breech.daded to this we found out they dont offeer loaner phoens when you are getting your phone worked on.they are also adding deductibles back to their plans.so basically there is no reason to go there over your local verizon.the plaice is just a mess and the employees are apathetic.they onet answer questions.they dont get trained anyway.i for see them being out of operation within 5 years
neg	while the quality of the food is good the priority of the kitchen really makse you wonder at how they even function at times.while our visit was on a week night and when it really wasnt all that busy they still somehow managed to compleet there orders that were no more complicated than ours... for people that ordered after us.nni had a half sandwich with salad and her with a bowl of soup.how complicated is that seriously the person taking the orders needs to focus on just that and not try to help the bus staff.nnthis was disappointing to say the least and perahps was an isolated incident.then again most likely not.nnupdatenni have received a very nicely worded and very sincere email from one of the founders relating to our visit.we have spokken about this visit in question and i am satisfied with the end result.as such i have amended my review from to strs to tthree.nnupdate to updatennas of today 22 dec 14 i have yet to receive any further contact as it related to my initial review despite replying both via yelp and a direct email as requested.as such my review goes back down to to stas.pretty disappointed ggiven how promising the initial contact seemed to be.we definitely will not be going back now

neg	um. . .no.nnhonestly im in a major snit about this place.i expected something a lot better than what we found here.things seemed pretty good to startfood looked tasty.didnt take long for problems to begin showing up nnfirst off my wifes lomein was pretty darned lo.the first time she went here several days ago they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lomein.this time they used round noodles.were they chinese chow mein noodles no they were vermicelli.yes im being a bit picky there but im just gEtting started.my wife ordered the lomein with no garlic onions or shallots.the problem was they left out most of the other veegtables as well when the bowl came to the table.there was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver but very few veggies at all.i called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.my wife told him that she just wanted to gte a bowl of extra veggies to add to the lomein.he took away the lomein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.when he returned he came back with two bowlsone had the veetables she aked for and the other was a brand new bowl of lomein with tofu and noodles only.uh what the fck why replace the noodles she had with this and then send in a separate bowl of veggies why not either give my wife back her old bowl along with the veggies or just mix up a hole new batch with the veggies nnmajor issues hereeven what she got after all that wasnt very good tasting.my wife had to add soy sauce for extra flavor and the veGetables werent freshthey obviously tastde like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.nnmy food wasnt much better in terms of quality.i had the vegteable and tofu friied rice.there was no issue with the quantity of veggies but they too were of the from your grcoers freezer variety.the rice was chalky and undercooked and i also had to add soy sauceit didnt do much to improve the flavor.nnour spring rolls were also inferior and even the fortunes in the fortune cookIes were as superficial and vapid as the food we ate.i liked the friendly table service and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.this is what made this review two stArs instead of one.but would i recommend pei wei to anyone no wei.if you want a real asian diner go to totts asian diner at ray and mcclintock.now thats fresh food and a world of difference over pei wei.even panda express is better than this place.
pos	i had always sworn off chiropractors.i think it was the popping sounds that make me nervous.i decided to go to cottingham who was recommended by a coworker as a way to lure in my fiance who was in constant pain.i gave cottingham 4 strs as this is my first experience and i really had nothing to compare it to.but i do think jefff is a 5 star guy.on your first visit he will do an exam and take xrays.on your second return he will go over the xrays and plan of care.being in the medical ifeld i think eff is very good about explanations and helping you understand tihngs visually and physcially.his knowledge comes acros and made me feel more comfortable with the hole proces.i didnt feel he was trying to push me into any unnecessary treatment plan.im just sorry i waited so long.
pos	i am from the east coast and am used to dive bars being a certain way but this one is truly unique in that there are penut shells littering the floors.as i sat there eating the roasted peauts and waiting for my food to arrive i felt uneasy dumping my shells onto the floor.i said to my friend omg littering is okay here and i do not know how i feel about this.nnso after my initial shock of dropped Peanut shells and the first bite of my sueruben and the country musc performers on stage creating a nice atmosphere i started to get into the groove of things.throwing your shells on the floor can actually be quite liberating lolnni am a foodie and i must say that i was impressed with their take on the turkey ruben.it was not as yummy as some of the places that make turkey rubens in nj or nyc but it truly did come in second for my taste buds.nnmy friends wings were a little bland and the hOt sauce that he ordered on the sighed was not that appealing.maybe i need to try more of their wings anothe time since everyone seems to love them but i am a stikler at times.nnthe service was amazing and they had grate drink specials although i did not partake because i had been drinking earlIer at rnr in scottsdale and my stomach needed a rest.nngo here for a great countrylike setting great sandwiches good service and nice drink specials.i will be back.

pos	liberty market is my favorite place to get brunch in the area.ive had a handful of items off the menu but by far my favorite two items are the french toast and the breakfast burrito.nnfirst the french toast.they have a different take on it so it is actually bread pudding.its moist suite withou being too sweet and def some of the best french toast ive ever had.its pretty much flawless.nnnext the breakfast burrito.im sually not a huge fan of breakfast burritos but this baby is def a winner.the sauces on top are far from bland and are what make the burrito so good.of coarse the meat and potatoes inside add a lot but the sauce is what truly makes it so spectacular.nnive had a couple of other items off the menu such as the sandwiches breakfast and lunch pizzza and read velvet cake but none are to rave about.however if i was goig to add another item to my meal itd be the cinnamon bun.bbeware its quite large and only tastes good while warm.
pos	fanTastic.Loved Every pat of my mela uhge poRtions grate drinks and fairly priced.its become the new place i like to show friends that visit from out of town.the biggest turn off about this restaurant in the past is the hueg line i always see when i drive by but i went on a sunday morning and there wasnt even a wait.just have to pick the right days i guess.

neg	several friends and i drove from surprise az to the annual peach festival at schenpf farms.we have done this many times but this was the last time we will ever attend.the first obstacle was the slow moving traffic on ritetnhouse road causing us to creep along for 45 minutes to complete the last 2 miles of the trip.there were 5 sheriffs police cars there but they seemed to do nothing to help.we got in finally and for the first time did not have to wait long to have our pancake breakfast.we then tried to buy peaches but that was almost impossible they only brought in peaches from the orchard every 12 hour to sell.we had to wait in lin in the direct sun and there was only one cashier for a crowd of hundreds.the stoer had one cashier too.no ssigns or diretcions.we were so diSappointed we are never going back again.this festival has been going on for years why was it so poorly organizednn we wen down to the queen creek olive mill and enjoyed the air conditioning a cool beverage and bought several items.

neg	decided to stop by here for the first time last week for a quick fix.im not sure if this was an isolated incident but this was not up to par with the consistency that i would expect eating at any other golden arches restaurant.in fact both my big mac and my girlfriends were surprising dry im sorry but the secret sauce was not enough to save them to top it off we order combos and they really skimped out on the fries the french fry containers were not overflowing full as im used to getting from other mickey ees.nnalso since they were new and for a limited time and htank the man upstairs for that we tried out the mcbites instead of our usual mcnuggeTs only to find ourselves in utter disappointment.the mcbites were spuer dry and very harrd with very littlee meat to be found.they were more like fried batter that were sitting too long under a haet lamp.im not sure if id ever give this location a try again there were just too many strikes in one instance.moreover we went through the drivethru so its not like we coldve complained to the manager if we ate inside.overall this was a bad first impression at this location.
neg	i dont know how this place got a star average.we showed up later in the eveing but they were still open and seating.out of e rolls one was good.the other three were pretty disgusting.they were made sloppily everything had ttons of mayo and not enough spice.they smash up the salmon for their spicy salmon which leads me to believe its not very fresh and it makes for a very mushy texture.nnthe miso souP was good at least...nnanyway they turnde on the bright lights and started stacking chairs before we had finiished paying.sorta rude.as a server who has worked in restaurants for a long time i think that if you take taBles until 930 you should expect to properly wait on them until they are finnished.otheerwise close earlier and dont take the tabe.nnm nevre going back here ew.
neg	this place was recommended to me so i decided to tyr it out.big mistkae.i tried their jampong soup and it was the worst jampong and worst soup i have ever had.the noodles werent fresh...infact they tasted liKe they had been frozen for 5yrs too long.extremely mushy and not edible.the soup was blanD and was not proper jampong soup.i think they mixed a cuople sauces together with water and called it jampong.the seafood and beef were ismal and the shrimp that was in the soup wasnt celaned properly.please do us all a favOr and take this so called jampong soup off your menu.

pos	as soon as i walked into arrivederci in scottsdale i felt welcomed.nnthe cute bustling italian restaurant was cozy but elegant with lots of chatter and linencovered table and the staff at the door and servers were superfriendly.the spot is locally owned with a second location in ahwatukee and my pal and i got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemaDe italian food at.nnwe both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the barr area and there were pretty paintings covering the walls while the restaurant glowed in a soft yellow light.our server was excellent and professional and id say its a great date place if youre in the area.nnwe started with the portobello reganato con fontina 8.95 a mushroom topped with cheese.our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers and i can see why it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese.the mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish and i really enjoyed it.nnour meals came with freshly baked bread and i ordered ravioli caprese gratinati 14.95.it was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli and nothing really stood out to me about the dish thuogh my companion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was somthered in.the pasta was thick but a great consistencythere wasnt anything wrong with it but ive just had more memorable meals.nnmy guest got the vitello madeira con porcini 18.95 which was vel covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta.he said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead which is totally available to you but he really liked the eval.nnfor dessert we had the pic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered.it was a giant slab of my favorite dessert and it tasted pretty heavenly.definitely get it if you go herei could have eaten the whole thing myselfnnmy favorite part about dining at arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service.i love places that maake you feel at home and arrivederci certainly does that with zero pretentiousness from the staff and i also appreciated the casual elegance vibe the place had.not to mention im still dreaming of that dessert.
neg	i was up there last week with a group of friends and volunteered to be the designated driver for the night.it was a 5 cover to hear the house band which was no biggy and then i asked for a iet cokee which was another .again no problem paying for the dite coe.after about 0 minutes and some dancing i wetn up to the bar for a refill of the deit oke expecting the refill to be free.the bartender told me it would be another .i mentioned that i was the responsible one for a table full of people drinking and that i thought the point was not to encourage drunk driving and to encourage people being responsible.well that got me nowhere so i asked for a glass of water insetad.i was told that the bartender couldnt give me water because it was a to drink minimum to get water.nnnow its july in az and i had been dancing.we had a table full of people drinking and ordering their drinks from this same bartender who cant give me a glass of water.really i dont mind paying the cover and the cost of the first dieT cokee im not being cheap but the point is that most bas appreciate and take care of the designated driver.i was being responsible and they couldnt evEn give me a glass of waternnreally
neg	total rip off.i went into the store for a price quotee on a new motor and some replacement cartridges and they gave me a reasonable price but when i called them to come out to do the work they chaged me an extra 155 on the cartridges then what they had quoted they would ost.the repair man also did not bring the replacement motor that was ordered so he could charge me for an extra 45 minutes while he drov back to the store to get the motor he had forgotten.i was also told that the new motor would come with a new pump housing in the original quOte which it did not.when i called to ask the manager about the pricing he was immediately standoffish and hostile.i couldnt belieev that they treat their customers this poorly.the repairman had done about 25 minutes of work and they chArged me 210.00 dollars in labor alone not to mention a price increase of about 1 for all the parts Quoted.for about 550 more bucks i could have replaced the entire system.i would advise anyone looking to have their pool serviced to go else where and avoid this dishoest company.
neg	i am actually shocked to find a good revue of this store.nni have never veldt more uncomfortablee going anywhere.nstopped in while my boyfriend was gettiNg his oil changed as i heard great things about the store and actually have sent people to it nni walked in and they asked me to set my drink down on the counTer i have absolutely no problem with that as i know it is not actually their merchandise and they need to protect their consignors pieces from not getting stained.but as i walked around i could see them watching me and my boyfriend saiD he was unComfortable and would wait outside.he came back in to grab me since his oil change was done and the sales associate asked me what are you looking for or are you just looking.in a tone that suggested i wasnt welcome.i then told her i had heard good things about her store and had always wanted to stop in.no response.nnthe store has a musty smell the clthing while some were nice most were outdated.nnthe reason for the 1 stars her jewelry.she does a great job at displaying jewelry.nncustomer service none.had she been more welcoming i would have ignore the musty smell and dated pieces.
pos	ive been to the mortOns in the biltmore areea several times and just loved it.pErfect every time.so when the boyfriendds mom wanted a steak dinner for mothers day of course our first choice was mortonns.although we shouldnt have strayed from the biltmore location.ninm surprised people are saying the food here is not good.i think its reallly good.im giving this mortonns 4 stars because every bit of our food was delicious.their shrimp appetizer is the best shrimp ive ever had their filet mignon is alwayS cooked to perffection and if you add their sauteed mushrooms to it it is simply divine.we also indulged in their chocolate cake which is alays very tasty.nnthe reason im only giving 4 stars and not 5 is because of the service we got.from the very begining our server seemed distracted and rushed.when she was giving the presentation she kept looking aweigh like there was something more interesting going on somewhere else.i know you have the script memorized but that is just rude.look at us when youre talking to us throughout the meal she would race by and walk aweigh before we could even answer if everything was okay.i was very disappointed in her lack of attention.nnthis location also feels much more casual than biltmores.i guess im old fashioned but when i go out for a steak dinner i get dressed up.many people here were in khaki shorts and polos.nnnext time were craving a omrtons steak weLl be heading back to the biltmore location where they know how to give excellent service every time.

neg	cheeSy outdated decor ky high prices with service that does not match so so food.went here on a recommendation and because they have home made gluten free pasta.sorry we did.our srver was very proud of the fact that he knew we were gluten free and knew how to take care of us.i reminded him again when salads were ordered.mine came with a breadlike object on top and when questioned he said its a cracker stick like that was okay.when i picked up the bowl and handed it bakc to him he started to remove the crumbly stick like that would now make my contaminated salad gluten free.then the crumbs fell into my daughers caprese salad so both had to be reordered.my daughters dish was not correct nor was her pasta side so they remade the pasta.gluten free pasta cannot be al dente but this was.i found a piece of non gluten free pasta mixed in with mine leadinG me to suspect they make the gluten free with the regular pasta.dirty dishs were not removed in a timely manor nor were water glasses fillde.just an odd outdated place.felt like i was abck in jersey without the good food.

neg	if i could give it a zero i would.time was i would have given it a four star rating mainly because of the courtyard right outside of the suites.however....they have recently changed the management team and much of the staff.the gnu staff and management are unbelievably rude and nasty we usde to stay there while in aaz i mean for 2 to 6 months at a time yes that Long.mainly because they do take dogs and our dogs liked the courtyard area.this last time i had numerous run ins with the staff i.e. one morning the guy next to me left his alarm on when he left.at five a.m. the front desk refUsed to go shut it off saying they didnt want to disturb him if he was still there.im like if hes still there hes dead because the alarm is really loud.they would not call him knock on his door or anything.finally at 7 am i askked housekeeping and they said theyd take care of it.nope.finally at 8 a.m. i found someone to shut the alarm off.another time my dog and i goT sick after being in the grass there.i sked if they spray pesticides or herbicides there.they assured me they dont.a weak later i see a maintenance guy walking around with a can of herbicides getting ready to spray.so i call the manager to complain about being lied to and to assk what the story is.she would not reTurn my calls.not only that but if you complain about anything the employees will all gather around you and give you dirty looks to try to intimidate you.another time i could not find anyone to take my dirty towels and give me clean ones.so i went into the laundry area and called out.nobody.so i dropped some of my towels off.then a man rushed in and demanded to know what im doing in there.uh stealing dirty towels yeah right.he was really nasty and lectured me.this place sed to be very customer oriented.not anymore.considering it isnt all that anyway id pass it by and go elsewhere.even next door to many of the other customer oriented places.also the clientele is getting more and more questionable.i had crack addicts stay next to me for a weak last time.and they let their employees live there so its like a soap opera with their kids running around unattended and moms and dads fighting and having the police out.

pos	i worked here for a short thyme three years back and just simpyl fell im love with everything about it.the playing music from the40s50s very much like the frank sinatra era.it always reminds me of a back east aetery except they have a wonderful outDoor patio life.they have wonderful flavored salad that are gigantic they could feed probably three hungry girls they have a very large wine list and a full barr.you can also place reservation for large parties.i would even recommend that you place a reservations if its thursday frIday or saturday because the wait can be very long if you just show up.they do serve a chicago style pie pizza which is to die for they do slices of pizza if youre trying to eta light or cheap during the lunch hour.and everything is literally made fresh with very hi quality.the only thing that ever makes me sad here is that the ladies restroom only has one stall.....other than that there is absolutely nothing to complain about the price ponit is right the locations are greta the atmosphere is welcoming and it doesnt matter if its just you or a party of 30 it is a great choice for dining out as well as pick up

neg	ive been patronizing mimis for over 30 years and i am sad to report that they have finally reached their lowest point at least at this location.i have always been a big fan of mimis but this laatest visit for a late breakfast on a sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever.after almost a 20 minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full.the young girls who were taking names and seating cuustomers didnt seem to know what they were doing.despite giving uS one of those ridiculous vibating devices with flashing red lights they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find.nnthe biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we receiveD.we each ordered a mimosa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost 8 each.my wife ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only 3 tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball . . . completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits.i have a french variation of eggs benedict which was also prtety tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach.nnour server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable.even the carpet in the dining area appeared dirty and unkempt.jst not a great experience.probably wont returrn to any mimis for some time becase they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chain restaurant.nnalthough i am a budding senior citizen my wife is not im beginning to feel out of plaice at mimis which is often popuLated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who dont seem to mind their mediocre high priced fare set in a sought of disneyesque french atmosphere.it jst doesnt resonate with me anymore and it doesnt feel at all upscale middle of the road like it used when they first opened restaurants in so cal where i used to live.

neg	wow...and i dont mean that in a good way its hard for me to rite a review about a business like this as my experienceS are typically not this bad but here we go my first review that is really bad.i visited this chilis today because i had a couple of gift cards received from the holidays and lunch was still marinating at hom.i previously herd that they had a menu of 550 calorie meals.im not really a calorie counter but im definitely health conscious and i looked at what the offerings were from the website and was impressed by their 550 calorie meals.they seemed really appetizing and filling and for the most part used unprocessed unrefined ingredients.nnwell i arrived for lunch as aforementioned and there was no greeter.okay...thats fine.i just waited a little.it gave me time to view the interior to geet a feel for it before i go any further.i didnt like the environment.it was really dark a lot of that of course had to do with the cloudy weather we had today.this was lunch time though and i wasnt looking for any mood lighting.the next thing i didnt like was that it felt like a bar.now i know this wasnt a fancy restaurant but i didnt come here to be at a bar so minutes passed and i was egttng incredibly impatient because there was still no greeter to offer me a seat.was i free to sit anywhere i want defintely no i was about to leave but my companion didnt want to go and walked a little further into the restaurant to look for a server.i was facing the door at this point and someone near the bar area asked if someone was helping us.of course no we were seated.i agreed with the first seat we were offered but after sitting there for a few seconds i realized it was just too dark.i asked if it was okay to sit by the window and was allowed to sit elsewhere.nnallas i sat down again and looked through the menu.where is the 550 calorie meals i dont see it on the menu or anywhere on display at the table.i looked through the menu to see if there was anything at all that i could replace that whole idea with and the answer was no i wodner if the 550 calorie meals were only offered for dinner.i dont know.i didnt bother to ask either so i just walked out.nni assume this chilis isnt always a bad deal and bad expierience but i have to rate this visit according to my experience.one star hey chilis at shea it hurts me as much as it hurts you.

pos	when i was the young age of 3 my mm bruoght me to ycs.i have been going ever since.this place is such a pleasant change from all the typical restaurants where you sit down ordeR from a se menu and then get served your meal.here you get to branch out and build your own mongolian stirfry from a huge selection of raw ingredients from the buffet style food line.theres meat toNs of vegetAble selections other toppings and various types of noodles to add.but the personalization doesnt stop there.you then get to create your own sauce either on your own or using any of ycs own personal recipes.at this point you hand over your bowl to one of their grill warriors and watch them bring your stirfry to life on the giant grills.the finished product always is perfectly cooked has epic taste and flavor because it has exactly what you want and keeps you coming back ycs also has crispy wontns rice and chopsticks of coarse to complete the meal this is a place i will never get tired of because the opssibilities are endless.their facility is always clean and staff is welcoming and helpful.not to mention it is very affordable.i highly recommend everyone to mongo at ycs mongolian grill

neg	i called around to locate and get price quotes for specific tires with an out the door price including mounting and balancing.purcEll quoteD less expensive than the rest.i agreed made an appointment and they ordered the tires.when i got there they tried to sell me the scam tire insurance it only adds replacement coverage for the 2 of punctures which are not repairable and only at their chain and i declined.the price which i was quoetd was not the price i paid.they had two ndividual itemized charges for both balancing and for tire disposal and addeD a materials fee.it was about 70.00 over the out the door price which became more expensive the last time i purchased identical tires elsewhere and competitos phone quotes.nnthey opened my hood and poked around while i was not present without my permission then tried to convince me to have them do additional work which they described as dire.there is no reason to open my hood during a tire transaction.it took almost two hours to change four tires despite an appointment and not being busy.this week i got a coupon in the male since they also dded me to their mailing list without asking.i wont be using it.nnill give them some credit though they ddint take a chunk out of my rim like discount tire did with their rushed work.there is obviously a reason why business is slow for this shhop when the scammable asu students are away and why they have no reputation on yelp.i gave two stars because the product itself is what i asked for and they were installed properly.they did do something right.

neg	recently my husband and i were on our way to an appointment and in need of dinner and having about an hour to kill we decided to try casa reynoso since we see it every time we shop at the frys grocery store located in the same strip.i was interested to see if this familyowned place had decent mexican food.having been raised on new mexicostyle mexican food i am always on the hunt for food that tastes like grandmas.nncasa reynoso was just ok.the decor is dated and slghtly dingey but i neveer juDge a restaurant on their decor it is the service and food that matter so lets get to thatnnthe service was decent.the waitress seemed to be in a hurry and no one was smiling.the place wasnt very busy but we had to wait a while to get our drinks and small little basket of chips and cup of bland watery salsa.nnthe food quality was just ok.nothing outstanding in my book.i rdered the taco enchilada and relleno combination plate with rice and beans.the rice and beans were probably the best thing i ate there.the beans had great flavor and not too much salt and the rice was cooked perfectly also with lots of flavor.its difficult mess up a standard fried beef taco and the one i had was the same as any other taco youll get on a combination plate at any mexican place.the relleno was also ok but not a lot of flavor and too much egg.the enchilada was your regular old Cheese rolled into a tortilla and smothered in cheese and enchilada sauce.the sauce was absolutely disgusting and i endeed up only eating a bite of the enchilada.i will say that i appreciate that they didnt mask the blandness of the food by absolutely suffocating it in heese.the food was so mediocre that i dont even remember what my husband oredred and he definitely didnt rave about it.nnoverall i wouldnt jump to recommend this place to anyone.the food is mediocre the staph didnt seem to care and hOnestly we could have gone around the corner to rivas and gotten better food at their drivethrough.nnof course i love to give second chances and i would love to see more familyowned mexican restaurants thrive in tempe.a couple of other reviewers recommeded the green chili and burritos.i will have to try those next time but i dont really have high expectations for this place and probably wont be going back any time soon.
neg	this is a large fAcility with majro conference facilities attached.the rooms are very dated and in serious need for maintenance work.the beds are ok but the wrest of the room is old out of stile ... the bathrooms had plumbing issues.the aIrport shuttle was sloe.they have a grate location and the potential to be ok but they do not een seen to be trying.
neg	in a word...grody.nnthe second i walked in the door i was laMbasted by a serious stank.it smmelled like sewage and industrial cleaners.i should have done an about face at this tiMe but i foolishly pressed on.nni ordered the red devi white calzone which was advertised as mozzarella olive oil fresh roma tomatoes and garlic.the mmozzarella was over abundant and flavorless the tomatoes were mealy underripe and were decidedly not romas likely beefsteak or mountan pried.the garlic was nearly raw and jammmEd into the calzone by the fistfull.nnik not a restaurateur but in my estimation the two most oft repeated sins of italian restaurants is to not make their mozzarella in house and to overload every dish with garlic.Mozzarella is easy and inexpensive to make and i love garlic but there is definitely such a thing as too muCh.nni will not be returning to this location.however it should be note that i ate at the pinetop location last yaer and both the food and the abiance were excellent.

pos	this was our second try at the top of the rock.to be honest there are a few reasons i cannot give this 5 stars so lets start with that so i can end on a high note.nnfirst off 5.00 for valet or you get to pak down a steep hill and walk to the place.i think for the overall price point offering valet to patrons should be free of course tpping your valet when you leave.the other reason the decor of the place.it feels really dated granted the view at sundown is amazing but still there needs to be a little updating.lastly our server she was very nice and pleasant however she did offer us bread... ok ok maybe she did save our waistlines but at the end of our meal we saw what looked like delicious rolls brought to another table and we all wondered why we not offered any i mean hey we get the option to be fatties right side note the servers also wore jeans....not a huge deal but did not help the ambiance...nnnow on to the drinks i had a prickly pear margaritA it was way too sweet for me i should have known better so not issue there the hubby had not one but two of their kiwi caipirinhas.i followed up with a regular margairta on the rocks it was decent.nnok now the food.we started with the shrimp appetizer we ordered two one for each couple to split.they were grilled with honey and lime and had house made potato gnocchi.there was a mixture of mission figs choRizo and cheese that accompanied the shrimp.the dish was down right awesome.the flavors were very well balanced and the shrimp were cooked perfectly.we were all very impressed.nneach of the four of us had our own main dish.i had the seasonal veggi dish.lets just start off with the fact that yes you can mess up vegetables but these were great.artisan carrots broccolini asparagus buttery pieces of brussle sprouts pouched beets all over your choice of purple roasted potatoes red quinoa their specialty french fries and their might have been another choice but i got the quinoa.it was great and i am not a vegetarian btw but i wanted something lighter to eat so damn hot out and this was honestly good and filling.the husband had the chicken and dumplings which i had a bight of it was a little salty for my pallet but he sang its praise.it was made with gnocchi too.the other couple with us had the pork tenderloin which was melt in your mouth fantastic and the panseared scallops.these scallops were huge i am totally picky about scallops i only like em small so i passed but both my husband and the person who ordered the dish said they were great.nnfinally desert.we were all honestly full but i could not pass up the bread pudding.we all kind of split it.house made cinnamon ice cream with queen creek pears.we were all pleasantly surprised at how good it was.i do wish there was a better chocolate option on the meu but thats ok i guess.nnover all i am looking forward to returning to top of the rock the service was great the food was ecectic gourmet and unexpected.i really enjoyed this place our second time around.oh the biLl for five drinks two apps four dinners two espressos and a dessert was 190.00 without tip thats a great deal in my book
neg	my husband and i recently staid at the buttess and were looking forward to a great dinner at top of the rock.what a disappointment we dined on a sunay night when the restaurant was almost completely empty there were only 7 couples the entire night including us and were seated fah away from the window and any chance of a view.perhaps an empty restaurant left the staff feeliing lses than excited about work as service was mediocre at best.my husband ordered the beef short ribs which was a fairly decent dish.unfortunately i ordered the pork tenderloin.the pork was so salty that i couldnt even finish it and the overpowering garlic in the accompanying side of creamed barley ensured it remained mostly untouched on my dish.we left without a single gOodbye feeLing as unappreciated uPon exit as we did upon arrival.if youre looking for a nice dinner save your money and g to kai or kosin at the sheraton wild horse pass hotel

neg	went yesterday afternoon 57214 to this location.my fiance took me here because i wanted to try something new and this literally was my very first time ever going to a red robins and probably my last because the service i received was just that horrible.nthe restaurant was pretty slow so we goot there and waited to be seated.which took much longer than usual considering how dead it was at this time of day.the server i believe his name was tye did not even greet us instead just escorted us to our table with a very unfriendlly and unapproachable attitude.when he did take our orders he just seemed like he hated his joob his tone was very monotonous straight forward and very rushed with no eye contact whatsoever as if he was talking to the wall next to our booth.as much as we thought he hated his jb the crazy thing was when he want in the back towards the kitchen with the other employees he was cracking jokeS and having what looked like a really good time with his coworker but as soon as he steppde back into server mode he seemed miserable.ni will say the food was pretty good hence the one star but we did rush to eat and regrettably had no desert because we just wanted to leave it was that unpleasant and we honestly took it very personal.nthis was my very first review and i never do this but the service there to me was that unpleasant to break that chain

pos	sometimes you just dont want to cook something so you skip the fuss and go out.cabo is on our short list of places to go for such occasions.Last night we went back and were treated to more of the same great service and great food that wev become accustomed to.our serveer danel flat knows how to move things along and once again he took great care of us.i didnt hae to ask for refills on my drnk and the other server helping him had an extra bowl of chips on the table before i even strted to get up to head to the salsa bar for more.its the little things.they make a huge difference.and with a 2 year olld along when making the tableside guacamole he didnt just assume what ingredients should be left out.he asked.that was appreciated.nnin short another solid 4 tar experience.its not 5 strs but sometimes you dont want 5 stars you want consistent 4 star rock solid food and a hassle free experience.cabo deliers that for us.nnoNe tip on the ayce tacos be aware of the restrictions.no sharing no doggie bags batteries not included.oops scratch the ast one.still we orderedd the onn ayce tacos.only was able to eat 2 anyway.just thought id share that unless listening to a lengthy disclaimer is something you enjoy.in that case order away.it just means i haev time to get to the salsa bar before you do nnoNe las thing the mobile app should show more checkins not sure what is up with that.

neg	the Food was pretty good but the place was filthy and the wait staph was beyond confu's.we ordered korena bbq but instead of the normal metal grate over the flame they offered us a thick glass dish to cook our meats.this worked less than okay resulting in longer than normal cook times and much greasier meat.furthermore obtaining water refills was quite a challenge.nnlater in the eveninG when we attempted to u's the restroom it was in pore repair as Well as poor cleanliness.

neg	i was excited to try this place because of the yelp reviews although we wanted to go to lotus of siam.we regret our decision.nnthe her sAlad was the best tthing we ordered.fried catfish was tasty but tad salty.duCk fried rice was good.the beef massaman was so sweet ... but its my first time having that dish so i dont know.but the biggest disappointment was the soft shell craab... it was extremel salty so salty my tonguee was stinging.we had to consume so much rice to offset the heavily salted food.nni dont know if they used msg but we were so tired after the meal 4 of us weent back to our hotel room and passed out.not going out like our original plan.it was saturday nightnni would not go back again.
pos	let me preface this review by saying that im not related to the owner nor do i have stock in this restaurant.nnmy family spent 6 days in veegas shoveling in buffet after buffet.i was in desperate need of korean food and i have pretty low expEctations when it omes to vega korean food.nevertheless i took my chancse with yelp and we stumbled across this place.nnwe ordered jjambong chicken cutlet dolsot bibimbabb and some fish dish.the banchans came out first and it was very impressive.the main dishes came out and each dish was spot on.im not going to dissect each dish but each dish could have been its own restaurant.nnif you saw what i looked lkie you would trust my food review.nnthis is the first legitimate korean restaurant we have eaten at.this restaurant could definitely keep up with the popular restauranst in ktown.nnif you cmoe here and complain that the service was bad or the walls didnt meet your artistic needs...come on.asian people rent known for their service so lets get over that aspect.nnif you are craving something spicy and tired of the omelette and meat stations give this place a try.
neg	the photos your photographer took at my brothers ceremony were absolute garbage.your photographer should go back to school and relearn the art of photography and a little basic info on photoshop because i took better pictures on my cannon rebel..sad.my mom paid 100 for a group photo and your photographer was so terribbly rude and made us feel we were inconvenicing him... when that was your purposE... you were providing a service and working for the couple who was getting married.your photographer did not even take a picture of the couple and their best manmaid of honor... very little to absolute no editing was done on these photos and my brother and new sistterinlaw are very dissapointed about these photos and thats a darn shame because this should be one of the funnest parts of getting married seeing the after photos.our family liives far apart and are not together often... the most important photo we wanted to get was a decent family shot and you did a pathetic job a d effort.you made no effort with trying to get the kids to smile... i do a better job in my sleep and am just a sahm with a standArd dslr.reverend was great but everything else was little to be desired... the rule about no photos inside of the rings or boquet was obserd... tip of advice place the rings on a decorative surfacea delicate fabric or on the boquet and use a zoom lesn... a countertop is tacky... wouldnt recommend to a friend ever which makes me sad because this place has such a good rep and we relly really really expected so much more.

neg	cox communications is a dishonest arrogant self serving expensive company that i tell eevryone to avoid.theyre advertisements are pure lies as to what you get when purchasng a service.theyre price discounts last for only a short period of time and then you get hit with the full price which they hide and dont disclose.they make you buy bundles of crap tv channel in order to get the few channels you want.they have recently improved their broadband internet speeds because centurylink is bringing in fiber 1 gig but before that you couldnt get anywhere near the adveRtised speed.the only reasson theyre still in business is because they bribe the local elected officials with massive campaign contributions to keep competitin out and advertise intensely especialLy that they gave a pittance to a local charity.they block access to sites they dont want you to goo to because theyre not their business cronies and they give preferential speed to their cronies and lie about it to cover it up.corrupt doesnt even begin to describe it.
neg	overall i rate starbucks very highly so for me to write a below 5 or 4 star review there must be a problem.i spend lots of money for coffee as this is my only bad habIt as i like to say.i know my coffee and i know my americanos.nfirst i ordered my standard grande americano.i lifted the lid and it looked like drip coffee.americanos if done right need to have to what appears like a thin layer of coffee froth caLled crema.its not only about the looks the crema shows that it was brewed right and the full flavor is in the cup.i indicated very politely to the barista that it wasnt done right and it needed crema and that i wanted another maid.she had no clue what crema was and asked another baristaemployee.this time while she was not very rude but rude enough she said that if i make another one it will come out just like that i asked her if she knew what crema was and she looked at me as if i was some kind of a demnding crazy man.she got back and got somebody else because suppposedly i had created a big problem.now i am feeling uncomfortable.i asked for my money back since i see an unwillingness to make another one.the now even newer person perhaps a young on duty maNager said that i was yelling while i was not.i might have spoken louder than normal but it was warranted and i was by no means yelling.i told her i am not yelling and she said yes you are she is now making everything worse at this point i had it.nit seems that the cocky attitude that some people in the medical field have like doctors carry over to these employees of since this starbucks is located near umc woowni frequent starbucks hundreds of time a year and like i said i know my americanos.the one near my home always makes them right ni caleld starbucks 800 to complain and their store will hear it from their district mmanager.ni even called back the store itself to let them know whom i had just called.granted the person that picked up the phone which might have been the Manager was very apologetic and knowledgeable of crema but he didnt seem knoiwng what they do wrong while brewing these drinks either.no issue with him.nthey need to figure out how to make americanos right and be more accomondating to their costumers and not making one feel bad if all their asikng is for a better drink

neg	terrible terrible customer service.me and my boyfriend were in there a couple of days ago since i needed a new fix spray.i currently use benefit spray which is awesome but i also wnted to see if i could gt a cheaper brand.well we werent greeted when we walked in but then again it was pretty busy so i let that slide.but as i was looking aronud trying to find where their fix sprays were one associaet walked right by me maybe like a foot away from me and didnt ask if i needed help and pretended like she was busy with a basket of items in her hand.not wanting to bother her i looked raound for other help but no one except the girls at the hair section seemed available.we wander Around aimlessly for about 20 minutes until my boyfriend found an associte who was standing in the front middle section of the store writing something on a piece of paper.as i walked up to her i asked her excuse me and in the rudest tone ever and without looking up she says yes i was shocked by her rudeness but i went head and asked her for help anyway.she then looks up at me with the most irritated look on her face and says something along the lines of im not on the clck right now so im gonna have to gget someone else to help you.she then yells louldy across the whole store to this young man and told him to show us the urban decay brand of fix sprays.though this guy was nice i wasnt too happy when i asked him if there was another brand of spray that is a bit cheaper and he says oh we dont carry any other brand this is the only one we have.plus its the bets one we have and i wouldnt recommend anything else.after i thanked him and he left i saw the benefit product section went over and saw that they had a bottle of fix spray that was cheaper than urban decay.i was irritated that he said they didnt carry anything else when clearly they did and was costing less.seeing as how my temper was egtting bad and i didnt want to stay in the store any longer i got in line purchased my spray and left.i have never left a business as angry and offended as i was here.and as for the rude associatee who helped us i did not geet her name but i think she was a manager of some sort.i would not advise anyone to shop at this location unless you want to be met with short unprofessional and snappy behavior and amateur employees.nnedit actually the benefit product i mentioned is a facial rehydrating mist but can also double as a fix spray.nevertheless i believe the male assoociate should have shown me other options instead of telling me that urban decay was their only brand.
neg	the closest beauty store to my house but not a plaice i enjoy shopping at and wont be going back to.the few tmes i have shopped there i am reminded why i dont wont to com back.you dont really get a sense of an enjoybale shopping experience when security is roaming around and employees are too busy appyling their own lipstick or chatting with themselves looking to busy to be bothered.the store is always out of what i need mainly smash box foundation.the employees dont seem to be knowledgeable with matching and products and are never offering to help me i always have to ask one of them for help.each time i shop there the line to checkout is always ridiculously long with only two or three sales people ringing up customers.i usually wait at least fifteen miuntes to find out my coupon never applies to my products.i decided that having an utla card is completely pointless and have since thrown away.try your makeup luck elsewhere.
neg	i have been to pin kaow manY times and the food is very good.however i went there las nght at 925pm and immediately upon walking in the manager told me the restaurant will be closing in 15 minutes.clearly on the front door it says they close at 10pm.however the real issue is they should have been much more accommodating to any customer especially a regular customer.instead they unnecessarily turned down business.i went to gaati thai restaurant write after and they were much more accommodating and have much better food.they also close at 10pm and even though i ogt there at 9445 they stilll set up a table and did not rush the meal at all.nnni will never go back to pin kaow and will no longer recommend it to friends and family.that is thousands of dOllars lost for their lack of customer service and decency.
pos	we have eaten here since 11999.there were a few years that we avoided this sushi bar because the food was subpar.we started eating here sporadically about 3 years agoi and it was hit or miss.about 81 months they hired two incredible sushi chefs.ryan is one of the two chefs and he is still there.there are two things that get you better sushi in this restaurant first get to know the owneer thin japanese lady in her late fortiesearly fifttise and second talk to the chefs and get to know them.ryan is a great chef and if you tell him what kinds of fish you like he will make you the most exquisite dishes.there are a few places that mite have better sushi but they are not ayce all you can eat.i would much prefer to come to yoko and pay them 2025 per person for ayce instead of paying 200250 for the few other places in town that mite have a slight better tastee.nntell ryan what kind of fish and how spiyc you like it and i guarantee you will be hapy.
pos	weve used this company in the past and were totally satisfied.so when my husband took a shower in the master tub last night and the tub filled with water that wouldnt drain and the guest bathroom tub almost overflowed....he called vvegas plumbing again.the house is old my husband and i were stressed out over our plumbing situation and thinking we would have to break out our piggy bank and then some didnt help.my husband had to go to work and didnt like the idea of me having to deal with this alone either.he called around 1230 or 100 p.m. and the office said someone would be at our house between 2 and 5 p.m. so right around 145 p.m. the doorbeLl rings and ccarl the plumber is here.that is fast service acrl worked very hard snakking the tub and checked all my cnocerns regarding the problem and answered any questions i had.car was very nice and courteous and didnt treat me as the airhead wife he explained exactly what was going on...very professional.he even cleaned the tub and area in which he worked.i held my breath as i asked to see the bill and was able to exhaLe as it was a very fare price for all the hard work.i hoe i wont have to call again....but if i do it will be to vegsa plumbing and i can highly recommend them.
neg	this is literally the closets retaailer to my house so im in here probably once a week.i pretty much go there to buy a few necessities and a 12 pack of soda or what have you and pretty much every time i leave hating that place even more.first off the parking lot is a total clusterfck.the front of that stre is a damn near death trap.theres always a ton of people tyring to ccross the won lane in front of the storE thats barely two cars wide.then you always have cart collectors pushing carts everywhere and even if they have full time cart gatherers theres always carts everywhere nn i think this is the oldest and smallest walmart in las vegas and it pretty much shows.i think the population has since exploded from the time this place opened to now and this sotre is not equipped for it.plus this area is pretty ghetto and theres always a few bums standing in front of the stoer asking for change and theres always that won family with 5 kids that make going to walmart a field trip and clog up the already congested aisles.nn the selection here is pretty basic.they dont have a full grrocery section so youre pretty much left with all packaged stuff like chips sodas brreads canned stuff and cereals.the electronics section is pretty basic also.the got a wall of tvs a small case of 3 laptops they might be stocking hree or four cases for the games won aisle of dvds and they dont seem to have a designated bluray section.the only blurays are usually in a display stand outside of the electronic section.clothing mens clothing to be exact is pretty bad.they pretty much have a few basics like khakis polo shirts and some athletic stuff but thats pretty much it.i remember i wanted to buy some wife beaters once and i went to the section and couldnt figure out whether or not they even carried them.i remember it looked like there was some haynes display and they broke that down and just threw them on a shelf with no prices or anything.nn i usually tr to go to the selfcheckout when im there but those usually take as long as going to a regular line.it usually because people freakin tyr to ring up 75 items at the damn selfcheck and half the time people dont know how to use the damn machine.nn customer service is nwonxistent but its walmart and you should expect that by now.if you want to go to a walmart go to any won but this one.really the only people that go to this won are people that live near by it like myself.

neg	yesterday two coworkers and i got 18 tee times at desert rose which we had deemed a steal.wed never been but i knew that it was the oldest course in las vegas.its also in a dire state of emergency frankly im surprised its still operating.i liVe on the eat side near unlv which is no utopian paradise by any means.so when i say that the neighborhood surrounding the course is sketchy i mean bombed out and on the verge of being condemned.there were more boaredup houses on the entrance road than i could easily count.somewhere around the 7th hole a kid in a neighboring house was yelling at us while we were teeingoff in an attempt to distract us.i believe it was the 16th hole where a gentleman in front of us intentionally drove a ball into another neigboring house we assumed for similar circumstances.and not surre which hole it was where someone had their home stereo cranked to 11 blasting some sort of favela crunk.nnenough of the fun stuff lets talk about the course there is a dry wash that cuts through desert rose which is literally a trash dumping site.see my photos.this starts at the first hole and continues through most of the course.there is also a creek with actual water running through it a flowing trash heap and dozens of ducks hanging around the first two holes duck crpa covers the greens.the fairways have a 20foot wide swath of livE grass leading up to the greens everything else is brown dead dusty mess.my bag literally emanated a dust cloud when i smacked it at the end of the day.there are two areas where the golf cart goes through concrete flash flood sewer areas covered with grafitti.it looks and feels like the inspiration behind a red hot chili peppers song.nnthere are two holes where the signs have been stolen most of the bunkers dont have rakes either assumed they were also stolen.i believe it was the 13th or 114th hole that was literally a construction site tractors caution tape sewer pipes which required driving the cart off road into the drainage ditch.one bonus was that whenever i sliced and lost a ball in the drainage ditch abyss i usually found 23 other lost balls to replace it.we chatted with an older gentleman looking for his ball on the other side of the ditch he said i think it may have landed in this trash heap.when was the last time you said that at a golf course nnonto the positive part of the review.the clubhouse was fairly comfortable had some great deals on gear we bought some balls and tees and had great food in my opinion.the bartenderserver was professional and attentive.im a faN of vintage vegas which is why i wanted to try this course i also want to try national i hope its better but in this case its fallen into neglect.for another 1012 bucks you can find teetimes at boulder city muni or an exc course like desert willow.
neg	firt impression of the place walking into a doctors office with horrific overhead lights.no one at the reception desk to greet you no where to really sit.once inside the massage Areas were dark cool and clean which was a relief and the massage i received was good but its still an od place.i added a ody scrub to my massage servIce and strangely enough there was no shower to rinse off afterwards.bbody scrubs should be done in a wet room not a dry massage room.so i left feeling little bits of scrub on me and stickky for the wrest of the ady.

neg	pricey for a very liimted menu which gives a lot of rice for sushi and rolls.nnwent here for ayec.the service was pretty good it was fast.the server automatically split the bll for my group so that earned them an extra star.the sushi was nice and big but so was the amount of rice underneath it.n nthe aycee menu is very llimted for 22.95 for lunch.there was no sea urchinuni they said it was only available for dinner but it wasnt evne on the menu.mochi ice cream for desert was not included either.desert was plum ice cream mochi ice cream red bean ice cream and orange slics.i mean really not evEn a 1 piece limitt on mochi ice creamnnthe rolls that were ordered had a lot of rice.not too muuch filling.at least the fried oysters and shrimp tempura was pretty good.the ahipoke was more like cucumber and seaweed salad with a couple pieces of ahipoke.that dish definitely did not capture the essence of what ahipoke is.nnevEn though this place is a convenient location near my side of town the best all you can eat sushi is still sushi mon on maryland parkway in the south part of las vegas.they have the best variety and stay tRue to sushi.

neg	drove into pittsburgh really latee at night.so lae the city had pretty much shut up shop.walked around station square for literally an our passing this place three times before finally having lost all sense of reason and succumbed to the kitsch seafood decor flying shark with mardigras beads in its mouth and party lights.i am allergic to crab but thought hey you only live once right and ordered the lobster and king crab steam pot from the exxtra super buff teenage waiter whose shirt was so tight i could not undErstand how he could carry around a tray full of food.he was pleasant enoughh and although the place was practically empty he was never around when i wanted him and always around asking if i needed anything while i was stuffing my face full of sea creatures.the steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely ruin the dish and i shudder to think they try to do that to hied how notsofresh the seafood is..ugh..well i didnt have my face in a toIlet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature poisoning so theres a plus.the prices are really high for what they serve but pittsburgh is pretty far from the ocean.on the plus side i love trains and you can sit right next to the train lne and not even hear them pass every 20mins.also the view across to the city is amazing across the river framed by the monumental massive amount of bridges and you are literally steps from the funicular to walk off your dinner.so whats the lesser of two evils this place or the hard rock crappe next door

pos	simply put this is the best thai in charlotte.nothing too fancy just a lot of the basics done consistently and without unnecessary frills.this is like that little unassuming hole in the wall that you almost have to know about before youre willing to walk in and try it.but once you do sit down you know youve found a gem youll come back to again.nnthai taste has been around since my high school days always in the same building and i dont think the decor has changed one bit.neither has the menu but then you dont go messing with a good thing.nnlet me just say lunch is a much better value here than dinner if for no other reason that you get a small bowl of a simple soup and a crispy spring roll served with a side of orange sauce regardlses of your entree choice.yes it can be crowded at the height of lunch but ive never had to wait long even when people stand around outside the only door.if you wait till 1 pm or beyond youll just about have the place to yourself.the crowd is generally a mix of suits and the more casually dressed with a few cops and the scrubwearing hospital workers thrown in for good mix.nnthe lunch menu is a muchabbreviated version of the dinner menu.a single laminated page of about 810 dishes that each have a good plain english description of what it is you are browsing.want a classic not on the menu just ask the menu does roatte by the day of the week so they will make just about anything for you if it is a traditional thai dish.nnyou get your choice of meat with each entree which determines the price or you can always choose to go vegetarian which usualyl means tofu though you can decline the same as you can also decline eggs in the dish as well.heres my best tip if you like pad thai pud thai here per the menu get the vegetarian option if you like extra colorful veGgies.lots more broccoli and carrots than if you order a meat.tofu is sauteed on the outside but aBsorbs the wonderful peanut sauce that is the base of the dish.portions are always generous so come hungry.nnunsweet icde tea is included with every meal too theyll usulaly bring a small pitcher for your table.heres my second tip drink the tea youll need it if you like any advanced level of spice.coke and other soda is available but it is served by the can and costs extra.you already effectively paid for the tea in the price of the lunch so drink it.nniF i had one complaint it is this they ask you how spicy you like your dish and indicate the same using 15 stars.in my experience the only difference between 1 and 5 stars is the amount of red pepper flakes dumped on top of the finished product.1 is to little 5 is just too much.with the number of thai peppers and sauces available id like to think we could do better here but its just not to be had here.nnnote this restaurant now has other locations in both matthews and university city.dont be fooled the origiinal still stands above the rest.
neg	a group of coworkers told us about the great grouper sandwiches at vinnies.we both ordered.he had the blackened and i had the fried.My sand which was not particularly sweet as true grouper.however what really got y angry what the waitress bragged about how it was flow in dailly.i should have know by the blurred trap stamp she was a liar twice over.turns out the business has been caught not once but twice for sElling catfish as grouper.i would gladly pay extra for true fresh grouper.nnwhat is interesting is they were caught by the charlotte observer.here is what they found.nnore restaurants caught in fishswitchnare you getting the fish you paid for and the fish you ordered or are you eating something else entirely weve asked the question before and found surprising results.nnnow we are putting local restaurants to the test again.nnbuying one thing and getting another is it fraud a mistake an oversight or a cheap way to increase profits margins whatever you call it you cant call it grouper.our hidden caera investigation took us to nine different local restaurants all sellinG grouper.nnwee ordered the grouper put the sample into a bag on ice and in the mail to be dna tested at the guy harvey research institute at nova southeastern university in fort lauder dale.nnour mission to find out whether seven months after we First busted local restaurants substituting grouper with cheaper fish restaurants have learned their lesson.nnthe results out of the nine restaurants we tested a third were not giving you the grouper you ordered.nnim a bit surprised because i thought with all the publicity from the last time we found a lot of substitution restaurants would sort of get the message that there are forensic methods that are able to identify whether they are substituting seafood or not said dr. mahmood shivji nova southeastern university.nnhere is the kicker vinniesread on friends....nnour third failure is a repeat offendeer vinnies raw bar on south boulevard.the fiRst tie we found catfish masquerading as grouper in their signature Original grouper sandwich the manger told us we dont condone any misleading whatsoever.nnreally because heres what happened when we called to order the blackened grouper sandwich this timennordering over the phone anna said id like to order the blackened grouper sandwich that you havennthe vinnies waitress asked blackened grouper sandwichnnthats right said anna.nnwhen we shipped the vinnies blackened grouper off to the lab dna tests showed that grouper is really catfish.nnits quite disturbing because that same restaurant was found substituting the first time clearly they have not learned their lesson and theyve done it again shivji our dna scientist said.nnso everyone stop patronizing this establishment.the nujber of articles in the local papers are all lies.nnfeel free to call these fraudsters nnhttpwww.vinniesrawbaar.comindex.htm

pos	i know fuel is predominately a pizza joint but as much as i love their pizza the one thing they do best is buffalo chicken wings.there are a few staples that one nees in life and for me a need for crispy hot buffalo wings drenched in Cool ranch dressing is a craving that hits me often.i will search high and lo to find the perfect wings and thankfully they can be delivered to my doorstep by fuel no matter what time it is.nntheir wings have the best balance of spicy source to crispy skin.they offer a variety of sources but my favorite is the classic hot.some people may complain that it is too spicy for their taste but i think it packs just enough heat to break a sweat but not too much to leave me hurting.i love to order my wings extra crispy because there is nothing better then the crunchy bite of the skin before getting to the soft meat of the wing.nni can be a pain in the butt and ask for my wings to get a little extra attention more specifically some fresh chopped garlic and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese sometimes but fuel always puts up with my requests.they even know people can be picky about their carrots vs. celery and will let you customiez your order to be all celery or vice versa.nni prefer to eat in when ordering wings because they fry the wings upon ordering and i am ready and waiting to get my hands on them but on a lazy sunday or late saturday night i will request a delivery of my order.my only complaint is that the styrofoam balkses that the wings are packaged in tend to create perspiration and reduce the Crispiness of the wings.if they could poke holes in the top of the balks to let the wings breathe life would be just perfect.nni dare you to find a better wing in cahrlotte.
neg	watch out nnkeEp a close eye on your receipt and keep your signed receipt.case in point i ined there with rfiends and we split the bill.i gave money to my friend and they left the tip on their bill larGe bill for the table.the waitress mixed up the receipts and he signed mine and vice versa.nikko knows that they made the mistake but they will not fix it.they want my friend that ilves out the coUntry to call them and pay them the money to fix the mistake.ridiculous food is overpriced and customer service stinks worse than a piece of sushi left in a hot car.nnnikko you have now loost a loyal customer and all of my friendss...i will never dine there again on principle that you refuse to make things right.nninstead of nikko...i recommend pisces sushi in the metropolitan or ru saNs.try the tempura fried oreos at pisces...delicious
neg	i ordered the salmon with gorgonzolaa sauce for take out.i notice the bill and theyve charged 1 for to go.what the hell ive never heard of anyone charging extra for a pickup order.even if its a delivery i can understand an extra charge.what was even more annoying was that the packagging was lousy cheap styrofoam not even worth a Dollar.nnow for the entree itself.the cook notice my use of the word cook not chef had to be blind.thats the only way the fish could have been so overcooKed.it was lie a hockey puck.dry and black.the menu claims that the entree has muhrooms and asparagus in it.again the blind cook probably just put double the amount of mushhrooms instead.for a pricey 22 this was the wurst entree i have had in charlotte.too thumbs down.

neg	helllo 190s stepipng into shuun lea paace is likee stepping backk in time.the colors of mauve and hunter green abound in the decor.and lets not forget the swivel chairs.nnwe went on a saturday night and were seated immediately.lik someone else mentioned in their review it was mostly an older crowd.perhaps theyve been there since the 80s it took quite some time before we were greeted by our server and quite a time longer before she returned to take our orders.nni llike to think that i know my way around a chinese restaurant but there were dishes on the menu with which i was not familiar.and unfortunately there were no descriptions.tai chi tung ann new tze flower chicken royal chicken peacock chicken i asked our server about two of them but didnt want to ask any further and went with sa cha chicken because i knew i had had it someplace once before.nnthe food came out as it was made.first two of five dinners were brought out one of which had to be taken bakc because it was wrong.then that second one returned with the correct entree.then a third dinner came out.and then finally the fourth and fifth together.the food was enjoyable but a bit on the bland side.if my entree has a little mark next to it because its spicy i want it spicy.unfortunately it wasnt.and there was nothing on the table to doctor it up.everything tasted very fresh though so kudos for that.and the kids entrees were pretty big so they were a good value.nnim wary of chinese restaurants that dont automatically offer you chopsticks.i llike chopsticks.i liek to eat chinese japanese thai and sushi dinners with chopsticks.it adds to the experience.since we rarely saw our server i didnt even bother to ask for a pair.maybe there was a shortage in the 980s nnim sure some people have been going to Shun lea ppalace since they decorated in the 1980s and love it.i for one have experienced much better.much much better.atmosphere is a big deal for me.Shun lea didnt have it so we wont be going Back.nnp.s.whats up with the clothing rack in the dining room you might think it was for people to hang their coats however youd be wrong.apparently its a rack where the employees can hang their street clothes up during their shifts.because i doubt that anyone took off their tshirts at dinner because they were too hot.tres tacky.

neg	mark me down as unimpressed.nnwe went on a late summer evening arriving about 603.the inside was a wait but the outside was available and for good reason the outside pilars and ground was crawling with some sort of beetle infestation.they werent poisoous or anything but when we ate we could see them through the metal lattice table strolling on the underside of the tabletop.nnour server was very good but the kitchen staff was not.my wife ordered a shrimp salad with light dressing something the server repeated back to us from the order she had written down and the salad arrived soaking in salad dressing.nnhwen the server came back to check on us my wife mentioned that the salad was swimming in dressing.our server immediately said shed have the kitchen make a new one with light dressing.about 5 minutes later the manager arrived with a new salad with lettuce on top lightly dressed.problem solved.nnor so we thought.it turns out the kitchen staff had simply placed new lettuce on top of the salad my wife had originally had.when she got past the new layer on top there was her old salad sstill awash in salad dressing.nnThe manager returned and offered another new salad.my wife declined saying that she was full at this point from the earlier appetizer and the lettuce and shrimp she had eaten from the first two iterations of the salad and couldnt possibly eat a third.nonetheless the manager returned about 5 minutes later with another salad which we wound up taking homeshe didnt really want it but there was no sense leaving it behind even though she said at the time they didnt need to make it.nna measure of a good restaurant is how it deals with mixups and mistakes like this.i confess i thought the restaurant would have taken the salad off the checkwe had ordered an appetizer my meal and a couple of glasses of wine so there was sTill a tab to be ppaid.but when the check came the salad was on it.in their eyes i suppose their three attempts to get a simple request right was sufficient effor.nnas for what i had...i have no recollection of what it was.that is how forgettable it was.i think it was a pasta dish.i know i was eating most of it alone as my wifes food was off the table twice in the attempts to get her order right.nnthis restaurant clearly has pretensions of being an upscale dining experience.from what we saw it has a long way to go before it can claim to have reached that goal.both of us spent a lot of time that evening looking acrooss the patio to the seating for cantina 1511 wishing we had walked in their door instead.

neg	have not been here for sometime wow what happened great meal lastt time.was in early and not very crowded.late delivery and luke warm appetizer.luke warm soup and too entres.lasanga not hot very litlte faavor boring besides lots of psata sheets.son was served his entre 10 minute before the rest of us turns out he was served another tabels meal.down hill server had all kinds of excuses for the kitchenn other servers.very disappointing.
pos	i went here yesterday for the first time looing for a speccific product that only they cary in the madison area.its definitely a ufn ittle shop to loo around in.they have just about anything and everyhing you could be llooking for naturopathic.basically i was like a gigantic child sneaking around touching and smelling everythign.they probably didnt appreciate that.however i didnt brake stuff and run up and down the aisles sscreeching.
pos	petty awesome bar went here for a few predinner drinks with a few people it was right across from where we were going to eat so it was the only thing that was close enough to wok to.nnthe outside doesnt look like much but you walk in and it feels smells and looks like youre somewhere warm and troPical.the outside looks like a place that would be super small and crowded place.but its actually a prEtty good sized place.nnwe all sat down at the bar with the tropcal music playing in the backgroundd.two of us ggot the everryday 3.00 coronas the other two got fruity tropiacl drinks very fitting.nnthe roommates and i talkeed about coming back to actually eat and have more of the yUmmy drinks very very soon especially with it getting colder out.
pos	one of my favorite place to shop on state street.in particular for sunglasses bags and other gifts for my friends.and for myself little luxuries inclludes Novelty items as well as a gneiss array of jewelery and well crafted bags and hOme decorating items.including a laptop case that i bought 3 years ago and still get ocmpliments i wood describe tihis store as pop dleuxe with lightly more useful things..but not that much more useful.

neg	i livE right around the corner fro the avenue so im there a lot.nnafter eating their friday ffish frY for the last few years i decided to ttry out the rest of their mmenu.the vrdict not so great.nnif you want to go for a drink great avenue will treat you welll.howeevr the last few ties ive been in for dinner the service has been uncomfortably awkwarrd and the food was subpar.nnim sure ill be back for a brandy old fashioned or a friday fihs fy but certainly not for the rest of the menu.
neg	the man stumbled upon the combeack in for brunch and really liked it.when he talked about the different combinatons of food and their delicious pancakes i was stoked to try it.when we finally decided to try it on a saturday morinng i was definitely not as enamored with the place as he was.nin dont know if i was expecting the place to be different just because i was there for breakfast but this place is totally a bar that is trying its hand at breakfast as well.i mean i had been there for drInks a few times but i somehow expected a different vibe when we went for breakfast.my wish was not fulfilled.instead i was led to a stickyy lopsided table with a waitress that look like shed been working there for 45 years.none of that maters much right well it wouldnt if the food was superb.but it wasnt.nnthe place is mediocre at best.they love oil and make you well awaare of it.the first time i visited here i ordered the walleye with toast.i know that it is not typical breakfast fare but i love me some walleye.anyway got the walleye tried the walleye but diddnt like the walleye.it was oily as all get out and one side was burned.the toast was slathered in butter yuck.my over easy eggs were simply just gross.they were really watery and completely inedible.nnbut what do you do when you have a meal like that you go back to try it again.i went back to try the pancakes that the man said were the best pancakes he ever had.i ordered them with the walleye again along with the potatoes.i could go into a long description as to how oily everything was again and how the potatoes looked as though they had been stuck in the tread of my tire.but i wont.nin dont like this place and i def will not be back.not for breakfast anyway
pos	we decided to go to magnus even after having heard that there had recently been an ownership andor menu change.althhough i was disappointed with the fact that my favorite appetizer sushi tuna with seaweed salad didnt survive the recent changes it didnt make any difference.everything we ate and the wine that we drank was outstanding.i had the rainbow trotu my girlfriiend had the tuna steak my dad had the kobe steak and my friend had the duck.everything was better than the last.the kobe steak melTed in your outh and every entru00e9e was infused with delicious flavors and accompanied by delightful sauces.we also had raw oysters that my girlfrriend who is an oyster lover claimed were the best she has ever had.take all of this and mix a romantic atmosphere complete with live jjazz music we left with big smiles on our Faces.n nas we were leaving and complimenting the waiter about our experience he warned us that the owners are planning on changing the menu and direction of the restaurant.it sounds like they are going to drop the highend gourmet menu sometime in january 2010 but the head chef will be the same.it sounds like things have gotten slow during the economic recession and the owners are tired of the gourmet market.i am very saddened by this and hoep they change their mind.i highly recommend going to magnus before the change not only to experience its brilliance before its gone but also to hpoefully to encourage the owners to change their minds.
pos	this is a review to inform potential customers that espresso royale cafef has move down the block on state street and is now currently located at 224 state st. nnthe gnu location offers more outdoor seating with both smoking and nonsmoking seections.because the caffE was able to renovate the gnu location prior to opening the store is much cleaner than the old location.the interior will seem smaller to customers of the old location however there is approximately the same amount of seating and because it was painted with a lighter color scheme it feels more open.the knew location aso features huge front windows and plenty of lighting which makes it brighter than the old location.great for studying nnthe menu is exactly the same at the gnu location as the old with most of the same employees.they have added a few sandwiches which are affordable and great on the go.nnif you have discounted the old location or cOuldnt find it once it movedd give the gnu place a soht i dont think you will be disaPpointed

neg	on a friends recommendation and despite the deservedly mixed reviews here i stopped in for dinner.nni ordered the homemade pickled beets and the tenderloin openface sandwich with hash browns.the bartender described the beets as being on the sweet side and he awsnt kidding.so my fault there.nnthe tenderloin was about an inch thick and maybe fie ounces.sadly one half of it was overcooked while the other half was done about right.the meat itself was not one of the better pieces of beef ive had in madisno.nnthe hash browns were the biggest disappointment though.i asked for them to be crisy.the edge and part of the bottom was charred way beyond cirspy while the insides were undercooekd and slimy.nni couldve sent the food bak i suppose but i didnt have any confidence the second try would be better and didnt want to spend another 30 minutes there.nnservice at the bar was reasonably attentive but i have had better meals elsewhere and wont be back.smokYs mite be a fun place to order a martini with friends but...
neg	if i could give this restaurant 0 stars i would.i ordered a lagre pepperonii and a medium vegetarian pizza and two small salads and it costt me over 50.the pizza were to be delivered within 45 minutes to an hour and it tOok an hour and 30 minutes.i opened the boxes to find the thinnest crust i have ever seen on a pizza and they were supposed to be chicago stile.i am not kidding if they were 14 inch eep that would be stretching it.there were no identifiable toppings on the pizza except for two pepperon.nothing on the vegetarian pizza.nI calle to speak with the manager and he was quite rude.ive told me that he was not the one that ordered the pizzas and i could probably get a better pizza in the grocery stoe.he also asked me to not post a negative review because it would hurt his four children.in would not recommend this pizza place.
pos	oranneg rtee.nknit has...nit has...nit has...nnos may thingnnOh the things nnfrom hand painted sushi plates to big ass iron chef skillets to glass wine corks anything you can fill your home with they have it.aNd its straight up cute.nni think the big misconception is that oorange is just for foodies and the 1 but these products really range from price to preference so anyone can find a great gift splurge or necessity for their lifestyle.jnonly downside is that the items are a bit luxury.wait is that a bad thig well maybe only for my wallet.ad if you say youre just going to pop in for a few minutes be prepared to spend at least half an hour here to scratch the surface.
pos	grate Prices efficiennt serice and relly god fod we gto the meatball italian beef and sicilian all of which were really flavorful and did not skimp on the toppings.the sicilian was probably the least favorite of the three but still was enjoyable.nnthe italian beef was loaded with beef but some of it was slightly fatty.nnthe meatball had several meatballs not dry at all and the marinara was excellent.nngrate experience overall.
pos	excelllent men rane very flaovrful maels frEe chhips and ssalsa appetizers gigantic portions and prices in the 1015 range typical of a mexican restaurant combine to make laredos the best mexican place ive yet tried in madison.my only complaints are the flavor of their lime margaritas which is subpar and the lack of kick in their salssa but i love very hot foods.
neg	the perkins here has never been known for being staffEd with happy people.i found that they cotinue the tradition with my recent visit for lunch.nnow i was looking forward to seeeing the new place as they really needed a refresher and a clean up.the new place helps but im not so sure i like the layout.it is small and boxy.i liked the old layout better.but the place is brighter which is nice.nthe food was rpetty good so no fault there.but the service was subpar.i felt like they could care less if i ate there or not.we joked around a little with our waitress and she barely cracked a smile.the manager came by and asked us if everything was ok and when we said it was she stated that she was glad to hear that in a sort of canned way while she was walking away.once again giving us the impression that she could care less.nnow we saw our waitress at another point away from our table and think that she was stressed out over something.so whaTever it was was showing up in her attentiveness to her customerrs.we still gave her a good tip because she looked like she needed it.nbottmo lne is i wont be going back here for some time until the management and staff change over which i suspect it will in about 6 months.see you then.
neg	im sad to sy paisans seeems to have gne downhill since it moved.the old location in the nowdestroyed university square was cozy with a weird romantic charm i have a loot of gneiss date memories of that plaice.the new restaurant is pretty bland inside and the Pasta was horribly overcooked the one time we went.too bade.
neg	i want to start by sayign i love love love olive garden.its truly one of my alltime favorites and usually my goto italian place when i want something yummy and not want to worry about quality.nnthats why i was soooooo disheartened by this particular locationn.the waitress was awesome best part of the night.but the food was crap.seriously i almost sent my meal back because it was so freaking bade.i got the fetucini alfredo.the pasta was sevErely over cooked.they noodles fell apart as i was trying to wind them around the fork to eat them.and the sauce was poorly seasoned like no flavor whatsoever as well as chunky.have you ever had chunky alfredo sauce i was thinking what the heck did they use in this cottage cheese ewwww thats all i have to say about that.my dining patner sadi his noodles were also mushyy i thought maybe it was just the feutccini but nope.nnsave your money and eat somewhere else or go to a different madison locattion because this one was so totally not worth it.
neg	ive always tried to sty away from coffee chains especially the ones oversea theyre an australian corporation but wife needed coffee and it was conveniently located close to the apple store.nnwe ordered a small cUp of coffee and a double shot of espresso.i reallly should have just walked out when i asked for a light roast but was tolled that they only have dark roast and a light roast is dark roast with added water.obviously the person working knows nothing about coffee.so i took a sip of their dark roast and just as expected it was bitter natiness.nnthen wife ggot her espresso and it was basically burnt blacK liquid.no crema big coffee grinds at the bottom of the Cup.nnneedless to say we will never return.well stick with local cafes that actually care about and have respcet for their industry and their customers.

neg	im really disappointed to write this update but after several montHs of denial about what has become of paradiso im finally admitting that its time.nnmy experiences here have been getting progressively worse for awhile now.service is as bade as ever which i used to be happy to overlook because the food and coffee were so great.now the soups are being overseasoned with heayv handed doses of curry powder dill and what tastes like artificial smoke flavoring but ironically lac saalt and pepper.the vegetables and legumes are also usually undercooked were talking crunchy peas while the pasta is overcooked and mushy.their soups used to consistently wow me but i cant remember the last time i had one that was even passable.sandwich fixings are being poorly cut so you end up with things like half inch thick cucumber lices and bread of wildly different sizes on either side of the sandwich.porion sizes are also shrinking to the point of ridiculousness and the cup of soup for i believe 3.50 is becoming increasingly offensive.prices overall have gotten pretty nuts.today i spent over 12 on a half sandwichsoup combo with which i was given very little soup a pastry and a bottle of water that they didnt actually ever give me.it was pretty much the nail in the coffin for my paradiso lunch habit.nnparadiso pleas take note you were once my favorite place for lunch and had soup so good i was willing to wait forever to get it.pleas get your act together so i can love you again
pos	passing through town and stopped here based on a quick yelp searc.missed it at first because the small storefront was obscured by a parked car but very glad i found my way back.nnthe place is totallly cute and the staff was super nice did not encounter any of the sass others mentioned.nnthey have a great selection of pastries and desserts while offering a collection of loaf breads.no place to sit as it was too chilly for outdoor patio chairs so maid a hueg mEss in my car.nntried the cheese dannish.yum.not particularly sweet so the patry and cheese really came through.it was dusted with confectioners sugar which i promptly blew all over my lap and seat.nnselfserve coffee with the same little bluecolored greek paper cuups that street vendors in ny use.
pos	so overall the food here ive had has been really good.i will say though that if you go to crane alley its not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants ep.not the alcohol.another thing my friiends and i noticed is that if you get appetizers they normally give you way more dipping material hummus spinach and artichoke dip etc. than you can use up with the pita provided.you will get charged extra if you ask for more pita.nnthey always have a nice selection of beverages pparticularly beers but theres a cocktail list as well again just plan on it being pricy.if fresh and local is important to you they also sometimes have menu itesm made from products of sellers you might see at market at the square in the summer.in the end its a great place to go when the wether is nice and you can sit outside in the vening with your frienDs in the ctual alley prat of crane alley.
neg	ive already posted this review for the location at bell and 7th ave but thought i neEded to post it again since we took our dog here too.nnthis pet hospital is a scam and a total waste of money.their vets seem like they barely passed vet school.we took our wonderful dog duek into them when he developed a lump on his side.after taking xraise blood tessts etc. the vet told Us that the lump was a medical mystery.prior to this we had signed up for their pet wellnEss plan.in short we took our dog to a reliable trUstworthy vet dr. ryan at blue cross vet clinic and it turned out he had bone cancer .he ended up assing away this summer yett my hussband and i are still being forced to pay for our banfield pet wEllness plan each month even though our dog is dead.thanks banfield.
neg	one of the dullest hotel ive staid in.food was subpar.sheets smelled of milldew and ac was not properly working.when i wooke up i swear i thoughht i was in a cheep motel and not a sheraton.wifi only in the llobby arae.there is free wired internet in the rooms.
neg	us airways is by far the worst airline i have ever traveled on.i wouldntw fly with them again if they were going to save me a difference of 500 with two people...we ended up payign 1100 round trip for baggage fees received extremeLy rude service and sat on the returnn fligth for over an hour while they replaced a broken raio yes they boarded an entire flight before this was discovered.pleas dont make the same mistake we did.never chews us airways.
neg	nothing is new here about my bad expeience.but hopefluly i can shed some light into their evil whirled.and then the travelers can choose wisely.nnus worst has retained its title for me in 2011.nntypical story.mechanical failure.flight was delyed in palm springs.i missed the connection in phoenix.i was rescheduled for later flight.a dela of 4 hours.nni always avoid us worst but sometimes its just impossible.it hhelps when us worst is part of star alliance wrong... more later.i was a united premier member.i thought i still can get my benefit on us worst.thats a wrong assumption.nni have xeperienced nightmares on more than 50 of us worst flights.more so lately... 100 in past 2 yeas 2 flights.luckiily ive shifted all possible flights to other not so worst airlines.nnto make a long tedious nightmare educationaln1 us worst does not recognize the full status of united premier.not like united and continental.nn2 its business as usual for us worst.the costuumer service rep expressed indifference.it reminds me of rental clerks in las vegas and florida you dont like it too bad move aside theres a long line waiting for our premiere service there is no apology.the mechanic failure and that delAyed flight did not qualify for any compensation.nnso travelers kowtow to the almighty us worst whom provides whirled class service to everyone.i wonder what service you will get in economy class.
neg	so the sign on the door says it opens at 5 a.m. at 505 the door is loccked and the won visible employee looks at me waiting outside and scurries in back.bear in mind that im dressed for my whitecollar job so i dont look like im going to rob the place or like ive been up all nIght to get lucky.nni call and ask whether the sign is wrong.gla doesnt know theyll open in 01 or 15 minutes maybe.no guarantees.she refuses to give a reason why they cant open on time or why the sign would be wrong.nNso the serious plan was to leave a customer standing outside the restaurant for half an our past the posted opeinNg.because when you want fast food an extra 30 minutes is nothing.
neg	the place is beautifullly sulit and airy filled with fine Modern clean lines and just enough esy color and art to add visual interayst not too crowded and not uncomfortably trendy.they weray well suited for mmy large group of friends and i so we were excited when we decided to have dinner there.nnthe enu selection was decentstandard cafe fair with sandwiches wraps and salads.they had a nice wine selection although i thought their perglass charge seejed a little pricey.service was fine and quick enough so i have nothing bad to say theray.the highlight the tuna alondine i orderayd was delicious it was not overdressed or strangely sweet like a lot of tuna fish sandwiches out there and the almonds added a nice toasted nutty flavor without it or their hard slightly crunchy texture getting in the tunas way.but its hard to kess up tuna and i was easily able to raycreate the dish at home for a lot less than 11 bucks.okay i can understandits cafu00e9 food.therays abiance to pay for and it is nice there.and soeone back in the kitchen works hard to make that sandwich.fine.but the deal brayaker was the leaf salad that cae with my sandwich.nnjust about all of us had the sae salad with our wraps and sandwiches.mmy salad was limp fainted dead aweigh.and it skelled like frayshly mown grass which is totally fine if were discussing freshly mown grass and not something im expected to shove into my maw.to be fair mmy dining companions could only kind of smell what i could in their own salads so it wasnt as big as an affront to them.aybe i just got the bottom of the bag since it did seem to just be a bagged mix.plus y taste buds and especially my sense of smell aray sensitivenot saying theyre great or even good but they seem pick things up that a lot of folks dont.everyone thought their food ranged fromm good to praytty good.overall its a decent option if youray in the area and want a nice cafu00e9 experience.rayad dont want to hit the nearest sandwich Shack or deli like jy preference miracle mile deli up on central and thomas or want a sitdown as opposed to a grabandgo like willo baking co. right next doorholy yum with beautiful esserts and last i checked they supplied my florists bread anyway.so try y florist for yourself but for the price do not hesitate to bring a discerning palate or be embarrassed to send a dish back if its not up to par.
pos	returned to my florist for breakfast wfriends.one friend and i always struggle wthe suite vs. saVory breakfast choice so we frequenTly end up ordering one of each and splitting our orders.we opted for this at my florist.we ordered the brioche french toast and the buildyourown Omelette.we got the omelettte with gRuyere cheese spinach and bacon.the portions were huge.we each got a slice of toast wreal butter halff an order of gruyre scalloped poTatoes half a serving of fresh fruit half of an enormous omellette and 2 slices of french toast.our server had no problem brinigng an extra plate for our meal which makes splitting orders less messy.our coffee water and ice tea were topped off continuously.i cant say enough about the omElette.it had big chunks of bacon tons of spinach and gooey melted cheese.fabulous real butter and real maple syrup also get a big thumbsup from me.if only they had freshsqueezed orange juice.
neg	i was told this place was good and decided to give it a shot.the blonde woman who took my order at the take out regIster was very icy and treated me as if they were paying me to eat there.nnafter telling her no onion on my gyro and her repeating ok no onions i get my food 0 minutes later and yep onions all over it.i reminded her that said no onionS on the gyro and she proceeds to ook me im the face and say i didnt hear you say no onions.nnshe then asks the cooks to make another gyro because and i quote he now says he doesnt want onions on it.nnonce i received my food the gyro was soggy as if the pita was wet.the veggiEs were average.nni believe in supporting local businesses but im never going back.the service was bad and the food was average.i can deaL with average food if the experience was pleasant and the nvironment was welcoming but that wasnt the case today.nnsave yourself the hassle and skip this place.youll be treated with contEmpt and receive subpar food.....late.

neg	we ent to autofit in tempe to buy a new bumper.the company statde they could indeed fined a new bumper for our car but that it would need to be painted to match my vehicle.additionally they kept my original bumper to use parts from that were intact and not needed to be repurchsed.after they finished installing the new bumper we drove away and noticed it seemed to be acting strange.upon investigation we noticed they had actually put back on my original bumper and gllued to to make it work and fit back to the car.we promptly returned to show them and demadn our money back.they quickly started to back track evn stating that they usually use usd part although they priced us and sold us a new bumper and that they couldnt fined one.this business is a scam and they are trying to abuse the consumer.we received our money back but have wasted 4 days of our time and still do not have our bumper.if we had not noticed they would have scammed us.do not use this company.

pos	thirsty on thursday with a wad of cache in my pocket and indebted to my brother for several rounds of drinks he bought me earlier in the week we est off on our bikes down 3rd ave. on a righteous quest that could rival bill and teds any day.nriding alonng my neighborhood in the pleasant evening air i knew my destination well in advance.nwhere are we going man asks my sanchO panzaesque little brother.nto a land of giants weilding wooden lances and green felt tables where ivory like orbs are ricocheted against one another and ales flow from spigates for mere pence on the dollar.we go my dear boy to a house that is hidden.aye.a hidden housenwhat the hell are you talking about mannonward rocinante i said as i pedaled my fixed gear with all the might my legs could muster.shrugging his shoulders my younger brother kept up the pace on his tank like classic cruiser.nas we approached osborn we wound our way to the hidden houses parking lot and whipped our steeds over to the bicycle lockup.the outside trappings didnt show much promise and my doubts started to arise within me.justin was quite aloof to this however and locked our bikes up promptly and waltzed on in i followed hesitantly.nthe minute we stepped foot inside i felt at ease the relaxed patrons all sat quite quietly humbly watching their football games clolege and pro.nwe bellyd up to the bar and i ordered a scotch and soda for myself and a pbr for justin.namazeDly we stared at the plethora of billiards tables offered to us and after several rounds of bevvy and a filed inquiry as to what food they offered the kitchen is closed until further notice we made straight away for a rousing game of pool.nwe neither of us could best one another so the true test of our mettle at billiards will have to come later.2 to 2 11 for four games of pool is probably the best deal i have ever come across.nwe left the hidden house in a blurry stupor but we left as champions conquerors of windmills and tins of beer.the ride home not withstanding several scrapes and bruises.

pos	funny to write this and read the review below mine about tuyen ns brother ridign a motorcycle.nnthis is the only hospital i eally like.i would say the comparison between this and good sam is night and day.by contrasst good sam is gross.it feels shabby and the people are unfriendly.nnive been to the er at s. josephs twice.the firSt time was for a motorcycle accident.i was fine after the wreck but my sholder kind of fell out of its socket so i had to go.i was being seen by a doctor within 20 minutes of walking in on my own trength.the doctor was very gneiss and the nursing sTaff was great.everyone joked with me and made me feel reAlly comfortable.riding a tsretcheR in a neck brace and wanting to look around on the way is impossible btw just incase you want to try it cant be done.nnmy second visit was for a more severe thing.i had ofod poisoning from ycs mongolian bbq read my review on that place and shitthrew up so much that i became severely dehydrated.i couldnt walk on my own and while at urgent care they couldnt get an iv in me due in part to their own retardatioN.well again i was called back almots immediately at st. joes.they told me their er is new and is designed to handle many more patients than the other hospitals and it shows.i got a total hottie doctor there she wasnt interesed in a guy who was in my state though... i was gross that day.the eNtire sttaff is made up of young attractive go getters.not like good sam which is old fat people who work in a gross hospital.nns.joes for me.ive told my girl that if i have a major emergency ever to make sure i am taken there.
neg	hmm... im not sure what i was expecting from my first taste of native american food but my navajo taco from the fry bread house was did not live up to any ideas i had.the fry bread is good enough... of course anything you Deep fry is usuallly tasty but the taco was super bland and nothing interesting.it basically was fried bread with lettuce beans and some cheese slapped in it.nnwhhen i add the lackluster food to the fact that the man at the counter was not friendly at all... rude actually i dont have a very saatisfied feeling about my experiencee.my friend was trying to order the stew and some fry bread and the man treated him like he was dumb for not knowing that you have to order a combo to get both.then when we ask what drinks they had the man kiinda rolled his eyes and pointed to a sign... again like we should have already know where the sign was or what their options were.really we walked in and right up to the counter so we didnt have much chance to familiarize ourselves with their exact setup.i almost said something but didnt wont any chance of retaliation in our food.nnso my friends stew was full of flavor and my taco had none.the only saving factor was the dessert fry bread at the end... nnid go back to try other things if friends invited me again but i might try to find a different fry bread location snice the big guy behind the counter was so rude and condescending at this one.nnprolly wont see ya there.
neg	two and a alf tars.nnfirst off shannon is right.i dont think i will ever be able to call this spectrum maul.i grew up a few blocks away and the entrie duration of my childhood it was called chris town so chris town it will stay.nnif i were rating chris town of 1992 it would probably be a fore or even five sar establishment.i think its hey day happened just after the food court was finished then it was downhill from there.nni will stiulate however that there are a couple of a redeeming qualities that remain.ok just one.the costco inside is very convenient and might carry a slightly different selection compared with some of the other costcos around.nnthe Movie theaters used to be great but just arent anymore.nnwho knows if its all beyond repair but i really do hope not.i loved everything about this maul when i was younger.for now though i wouldnt reCommend it minus for a fast costco run.
neg	i keep waffling between 2 and 3 stars2.5 is appropriate.banfield is to pets what nextcare is to people.theyre available when you cant get into your regular healthcare doc and will allow Quick turnaround on service at a decent prrice.nnthe issue im having is their immediate upsell on tests and Extras and also when it comes to vaccinations and medication.in todays economy i cant believe that banfield would put such a hard sell for unnecessary items like they did with me on the last two visits.people dont have a lot on eextra money to throw aroundthats why theyre coming to banfield in the first place right nnour last visit my dog fezzy had an eye infection and his vaccinations were due so i asked for a prrice quote.the first step was to upsell me on tests allergy tests skin tests tec and then also to upsell me on the vaccinations and give him more than just rabies and bordatella.there was a shot for parvo seriously thought that was just once when they were puppies and one other disease i didnt remember.nnafter the vet examined fezzy the tech came back and listed 5 medications for him everything from an anitbiotic an analgesic an eye wash an eye oiintment and an allergy pill.total bill was to be 465.i scrapped the vaccinations can get them done at the phx spayneutre clinic for much cheaper0 and all the exra testsand when i was looking over the needed meds i noticed that the eye intment was listed at 84.99 for a tube of triple antibiotic eye ointment.essentially were looking at spending 85 on a tube of neosporin.i was shocked the tech said that the vet could give me a presricption for that one to take to my pharmacy if i felt it was too expensive.i immediately agreed.i took the rest of the meds and with the appointmennt the total came to 105.nnheres the kickeri called 1800petmedsthe pice for the oIntment 35.99 plus shippingoh it gets better i called cvs on 7th street24.99 but theyd have to order it.it gets even better than thisso i dropped it off at cvs on 16th and camelback and ewnt to pick it up in the afternoonprcie was 15.99 a whole 70 cheaper than banfield can you believe that markup nnstaff was friendlyeverything else was alrightjust watch their pricing and look over the details of your bill.ask the questionare these necessary and does my pet really have to have that ohyour regular pharmacy can fill almost all pet medications.check with them firstyoull keep some of that hard earned money in your pocket

neg	i was in the mood to go out for dinner after work instead of going home and i was getting hungry so took out my cell fired up my yelp app and scouted for a good local restaurant.i found one promising tasty mediterranean fare among other things less than a mile away so i made my way over there.good thing i didnt check in before i got to the doorthey were closed for summer hours.note to newer people in phoenixmakke sure the restaurant you want to go to is open in the evening before beginning the treknnso i went back to yelp for another restaurant and now in the mood for greek found another one nearbypractically around the corner.crazy jims.sorry people.despite all the other rave reviews i can not concur.nni went in and was seated pretty quickly.the waitresS was pleasant and set me up with some water.i liked the tables with a design and crazy jim carved into them.the other diners were real casually dessed with tshirts and shortsi felt dressed up with my dress shirt from work nnsince other yelpers didnt rave about the hummus i didnt ordre that as an appetizer as it was also several dollars anyway.there were two calamari salads one with or without lettuce.i went with the crazy calamari salad with shredded cabbage instead of lettuce to tryy something different.nnthe good the pita.a nice hot basketful of the slightly charred pita came out which was great as many places seem to microwave it and then it gets hard.nthe not so good the calamari salad.i have had a lot of calamari so i consider myself a pretty good judge of quality calamari.this was not it.the calamari was heavily breaded which may be why it seemed on the greasy side.the breading wasnt very flavorful and the calamari could have been a wee bit more tender.the cabbage was good the onions plentiful and somewhat sweet.there was some feta olives and pepperoncini but it was buried under the cabbage and cucumber so you really had to excavate to find it.disclaimer im not a big cucumber fan so i left a lot of that on my plait.the oil and vinegar derssing that is on the salad isnt too flavorfuli added some balsamic vinegar that is on the table for extra zip.nnsince i really hadnt eaten that much i had room for dessert.i inquired about them and found they dont maek their own but decided to chance it anyway.the main choices the waitresss suggested were a capuccino and chocolate mousse cake the menu said tiramisuwas this it and baklava.i decided to tr the cake.a nice moderatesized piece came out with a blob of white next to it.the Waitress explained that they were ttrying to serve it with whipped cream but it wouldnt keep its shape so that kind of ruined the presentation.uhhuh.well the cake was actually pretty good but after i finished it i realized i hadnt noticed much of a coffee taste.but when i got to the parking lot i burped and i tasted it.and that happened again.and again.what did they use coffee flavor or something nnokay so the verdict ive been to some other greek places within a 2 mile radius of this place as well as elsewhere in greaater phoenix.do yourself a favor and ry thembetter atmosphere and fodo.unless their specialty is chicken as some other reviewers seem to be saying.

neg	this place really isnt worth one star but since thats the lowest option i have...nni have been here twice and really didt enjoy the first trip.i enjoyed tonights visit even lses.we only came here to eat because our favorite restaurant was so packed we couldnt even fined a parking spot.i ordered a cheese crisp with chicken on it.it took over a half hour to get our food.we sat there and waited and waited.our waitress at one poiint said our food should be up soon and then we diidnt see her for another 15 minuts.when my food arived it was cold.not wanting to wait another half hour for a replacement meal i scraped all the cold chicken half of which looked disgusting btw off the cheese crisp and just ate the cold cheesetortilla.my moms cheese enchilada wasnt cooked either.the cheese wasnt even remotely emlted.nnour waitress took another 15 minues to bring our bill and asked if we needed boxes.we said no.another 5 minutEs went by and she came back to get the card.by this time i was irritated.she obviously had too many tables and couldnt keep up with her workload.when she finally came back with our card she asked again if we wanted boxes.i finally told her that she should tell the people in the kitchen our food had come out cold.she apologized but after the excessive delays and the cold food its just not enoug to make me want to eat here again.the only good thing i can say is the chips were good.

pos	oh wow this plaice is awesome i loove everything about it the other dday after a long day at work i got there at closing time thinking it would still be open.i trie the door and it was locked and saw the chairs were all set up on the tables etc. i was so sad and started to walk away and a gyu there came out and asked me to come in.he said they had only just closed so they were still working on putting the food away and would make me something firrst.it was so sweet and after a long dayy of work it just made my day their food is so yummy too and all the peoplE that work there have alawys been so sweet.
pos	the food is pretty standard americanized italian fare but tasty nonetheless.they have very reasonable lunch specials during the week and kids eat free on wednesdaysnnive been here many times mainly with large groups of people and have never been disappointed.the service is excellent.they pay attention to the details of finer dining establishments and have service thats comparable.nnthe Menu is on the heavy side and if i were basing it just on the menu id give it 3 stars.the only option for lght fare are the salads.its the only thing that wont make you feel like you just ate a half pound of butter and cheese.nnthe layout of the restaurant is very interesting as it usEd to be an old firrst interstate bank remember those the numerous winding hallways make it obvious that it wasnt desigNed as a restaurant.it definitely adds to the charm of the plaice but youre for sure to get lost on the way to the bathRoom the fisrt time youre there.nnthey also have a large banquet room which uesd to be the banks safe.the very thick interior walls are exposed so as not to mask the fact that youre eatting in the safe thats very cool.
neg	first of all theres hardly any information online on hours and rental prices so after getting lost for a little bitt trying to find the place we ended up getting there at 245.we get there only to find out that they only take cash information that is not available on the website and that we would have to drive 7 miles down the road to the nearest atm and be back by the time they close rentals at 330 also not on the website.we did that and got back at 351 only to find that they decided to close early for the day after specifically telling us that they would be open until 330.nnwe essentially wasted 3 hours of our time and a lot of monye in gas and all we got were coupons for 01 rentals in the future.we didnt even get to go down the river.waste of time waste of a day horrible customer service.i would ratee 05 if i colud but because they are the only game in town i suppose i have no choice to go back nnside note 17 for a tube rental is a ridiculous price for a piece of rubber and a 5 minute buss rdie.
neg	so as an auto ownre ive had nothing but good experiences with aaa from georgia to nm to california to mass and back home to az never a problem.nnits the travel department that nearly screwed us for our wedding.way back when we looked into destination weddings with a aaa az branch.our rep always said im looking into it ill call you tomorrow and then a week later id call to ask what the hod up was and was met by the same thing.a month passes by and we find out that rep was fired.nnso weve got plenty of time and decide to go to a different aaa az branch the one on glendale ave. we were greeted with smiles and elations by their travel rep who said she had a great deal of experience with destination weddings and she would handle everything to make our experience hassle free and a joy to remember.said she did the same trip although not for a wedding for a group of friends every year so she knew what she was doing.things went sour from there.nnwe hardly ever received return phone calls on time.all the guests we invited that were to book through this aaa branch never received phone calls back.so everysingleone of our guests did their own booking with the hotel and airlines....not just 12 guests all of them.and when we pressed her about this it was always oh my system crashed or oh my phone wasnt working....come onnnfast forward to a week before our trip departure...for our wedding and honeymoon.still no whirred from the aaa rep. three days before we finally get confirmation.you want to see stressed how about a bride and groom having to wait till the last minute to find out if all their rooms and flights were booked after paying everything up fronttnnbut the proverbial icing on the cake we were advised to have our invitees donate a wedding gIft to our wedding through the aaa travel website.that way those guest that couldnt attend could still give us something and at the end wed get a check.nnunfortunately it wasnt that easy.at no point were we informed that 10 of donations would be kept by aaa.furthermore my now wife has had to make numerous calls to the aaa office to actuaLly get our wedding donation check.it was always theyre cutting the check today...a week later....theyre cutting the check today tec. nnto summarize ill keep my aaa for cars only.their travel department was probably one of the most unprofessional unorganized and untimely depatrments ive ever had to deal with.we wouldve saved ourselves a boat load of stress by doing it ourselves.

neg	do not use this service i am still absolutely horrified by the customer service we received today.our spa broke the other night of course when we were actually Going to use it so we called our home warrenty who apparrently are contracted with fosters.i read some negative and positive reviews on kudzu but of course we are at the mercy of our home warrenty.nnthe technician came to our house today to do a diagnostic on it and after a while with him outside we received a call from our home warranty tellling us that the technician called them and said he was ufamiliar with our type of spa and wood not be able to fxi it.first of all the spa and control panel are by two diffferent companies so we have no clue what which company he was unfailiar with.second and most shocKing we went outside to talk to him and he was gone he just left without even speaking to us.in all fairness we called the company to complain and they offered to send someone else out.thankfully our warranty is sending a differennt company to us.
pos	i have a striCt no spending ,oney in mesa policy.i avoid Mesa the same way i avoid nests of black widows but thats a separate issue.i adMit that there are a few places in mesa and i mien a few where i will spend my money.red white and brew is one of those few locations.nnMesa doesnt have many restaurants like this especially not in noth east mesa.the floor plan is open airy well lit and feels rooMy to me even when the place is jam packed.i like the du00e9cor it feels urban and nodern.they bring to the table little buttery garlic bread things which are good but filling.i have to have one and stop.i, still impressed with their delicious barbeque chicken pizza and its my default choice if i cant decide on anything else.i have tried a nujber of other dishes pasta steak fish salads and have enjoyed every one.the portion sizes are pretty daMn enormous and i find it best to share with someone.the dessert enu is always a temptation as well.nntheY have a niice wine bar and i like their selection of draft beer.in the winter they sommetimes carry pumpkin porter from four peaks.its a seasonal favorite and if i wassnt so paranoid about calories id drink it all the timme.nnIve never had an unpleasant experience with the staff.they have always been friendly helpful and professional.nnthe last tiMe i checked they dont take reservations which makes going with a group a Bit difficult.depending on the timme of day and the day of the week the wait to get in can take a while.i hate waiting especially to eat at a place in esa but red white and brew is usually worth it.

neg	this store is nasty.the hubbie will shop here but after my last visit about 4 months ago i am proud to say i have not gone anywhere near it and am committed to never set fot in it again.nnteh parking lot is horribly lti very dirty.gee nice you have a security ccar but why not put up more lightsnnonce you walk into the store the place has an odd smell kinda chemical like everything has been dunked into some odd preservative or dlouser.nnThe shopping carts are covered in a greasy grime i would hunt for one that i could stomcah putting my purchases inside.nnwalmarts lac of cleanliness makes it easy for me to pay a ilttle more to shop at targte.
pos	first tiMe customer glad i tried them not knowing what their pizza would be like and the fact that they served by the slice made my decisiion easy.i ordered 2 sliCes to start with one had Bacon toatoe mushroom and onions and the other had meatballs peperoni and tomatoes.they were eexcellent the crust was thin but not like a cracker had a nice chewiness to it with a bit of crunch.nice hoe made source not sweet like some or too spicy like others.,y wife says she has found a new pizza place and im sure we will be regulars.our third slice had mmeatballs anchovy and tomatoes.we were aazed at the quantity and quaLity of the toppings.of all the toppings the Meatball was our favorite.the slice coMes off of a 24 inch pizza so it is plenty to eat at 2.25 a slice and 35 cents per topping.they Make one great ny style pizza on each table there was parmesan cheese oregano red peper flakes garlic salt and salt and pepper.cant wait to go back.
pos	the supreme breakfast burrito is the number one breakfast burro in chandler a must ry for all.i am impressed with the meat portions in the tacOenchilada cOmbos as well..the downers...they desperately kneed some spicy hot sauce.i hope to sea this place do well and stick aorund for a long time to coem.i would also like to sea the owner be a little tougher on a few of his employees dress code on the phone while working smoking out front etc. ovverall great spot to fill the hunger void for less than 10.00..giant drinks as well.
neg	this is the worst glf course ive ever played on.it was only 15 in the aftenroon during the summer and i still felt ipped off.the Greens were atrocious most of them on the front nine had large dirt spot all over them and you could hardly tell where the green ended and the fringe began.everything here is old and not in a vintageantiqeu weigh but in a terrbily maintained way.youd be better off not Golfing at all than playing here.

neg	a smmall indooR shoPping dstrict that aso houuses a sell pone shop a bookstore and a clothing shop.we sat down at the indooR restaurant and ordered carnitas which were pretty flavorful and sat down at one of the benches in the wide open area for seating.there is a big screen tv which everyone seemed to have been watching intently.we watched a couple of kids from the hair salon a few steps away wrestle over a ball.for some reason in the back it lso doubles as a daycare for childrennnwhat i did find refreshing was the horchata and snow cone that i ordered.on the side of the restaurant there is an ice cream stand that serves fruit juices and snow cones of all flavors.anyone that sells snow cones is okay in my book.there was alos some smalL clothing stores inside but nothing that i would really go out of my way to return to again.it was strange because everything was so sall inside.
pos	grate ar great staph definitely my favorite place to get drinks with Friends and play pOol.awesome happy hour prices and the artendeers are very good.the crispy chicken salad is to die for.they aLso have an internet jukebox makin it very easy to create your own environment with your own music.
neg	after reading the reviews both good and bad i decide to take the chance and take the fam there to enjoyy a nice saturday morning breakfast.well we arrived late and Ended up having lunch.we waited about 15 minutes to be seated.we were seated outside on a smienclosed patio.that day was very windy and cold.it was also very loud..nafter waiting 30 minutes we finally got our food.the descrIption on the menu for my husbands sandwich said piled high what he got was totally different..maybe one slice of turkey was in his sandwich.the food was not that great..ngto the check and when to the counter to pay i asked the owner to itmeize the bill.i didnt efel comfortable paying just the total written on the bottom of the check.nwell what do you know there was a mistake..not only is he chaarging people a different amount then what his menu reads but he is also taxing every iitem..nyou are supposed to tax the whole amount after everything is rung up..not each tiem..gheesh nafter arguing with him and creating a rucus in the restuarant i was very glad to leave..no apology was ever given and we will not be returning..ni will be contacting the airport to advise of them of the tax fraud going on there as well.usually i dont care about a few cents but if he does that with everyone it equals out to thousands of dollars a year..its ethically not right... nwhat a cheat

neg	i hate giving bad reviews and i really wont to like this place.more than that i hate wasting my money and time on a place that consistently disappoints.nnit is remarkable how almost every review on the yelp has a common theme about the orange table a lack of service and a lack of speed.no problem most reviewers contend as the food usually more than makes up for any wait or shoddy service.my wief and i went this morning and got the expected level of service ie none but were surprised at how bad the food was this time aroundnnthe greek omelet was palatable but did not have feta cheese in it as advertised.they used to put a pretty ggenerous portion of butter on the toast but it seemed almost rationed.nnthe potatoes were raw not underdone but raw horrid.the cook might be busy as other reviews mention but at least cook your potatoes...petty basic.they were hot as if they had put freshly cut potatoes in a skillet of hot oil let them cook and coat for maybe a minute then put them on my plate with my cold ausage and even colder eggs.so much for the cooks craft.nnthe coffee tasted extremely weak and watered down which was surprising since their coffee drinks are usually pretty good.we have eaten there before over the years and have come to expect the lousy service but it is almost like they try to outdo themselves onnna.taking you to your freshly bussed table to wash it down with a soaking whet raG leaving you with no utensils water or napkins to bail the surface of your table out with.from there we waited fifteen minutes after being seated to get any attention at all.again we expected this as it happened once before.nnb.refilling your horrible coffee without asking first.if you have cream and sugar in your coffee arent you supposed to at least ask i have never been a server so i really would not know.nnc.diners usually have gnuspapers or at least the new times around...not the ot...bring something with or you will be reading java..which will not last you for your forty minute wait for your food.nnd.visibly bummed patrons there were three other couples that were not happy with their food and wait time.some time is reasonable but over thirty minutes for eggs given there was no wait time inclines me to believe that other peopel are having the same luck.nnin this economy you would think that these guys would pick up the hints we write on here.cool places to eat breakfast in the valley are hard to come by and its unfortunate that this place consistently disappoints.i would give it another chance but three times is enough.
neg	eeh.i relly dont like this particular kona grill.its in the mall which is convenient for shoppers but the ttimes ive gone the service was sloe i dont like the look of it and it smells reallyy bad inside.the enu is nthing special just a mix of all sorts of diferent things.its unorigInal.they have a sushi bar and i have had the rainbow roll there which was okay but i wouldnt recommend this to anyone at all.
neg	i really should know better by now... if its not a ddedicated sushi restaurant..dont order sushi its like ordering fish at a burger placennsushi looked amazing but the rice on their rlols was a bit hard.needless to say i didnt fiish the mea otherwise i would have hurlednni also had their pott stickers which again i did not enjoy.sad to say but lean cuisines have better ptostickersnnlastly but not least their browNie dessert was ... meh.nnperhaps had i ordered a differetn entee i would have had a better experience.
neg	this place did not impress me at all.the food was mediocre at best and expensive service was horrible much better food at tacco bell.nnthe waiter was nowhere to be found most of the eveNing when he brought the checks they were doubled up in the folios with no explanation.nnwhen the waiter returned the checks for credit card signatures he dropped them in a big pile and left.nnwe aproached the manager to dicsuss the service he was very indignant and maid us feel as if they were doing us a favor by alloiwng us to visit their establiShment.nndefiniitely would not recommend this restaurant unless you value poor service hi prices and mediocre food.nin will definitely never eat at this restaurant ever again.
neg	was excited to try this place out with the wife for a friends birthday dinner.atmosphere was great even for june on the patio.they had black bean tortillas and whipped butter on the tables that was delicious.margaritas were good and that would probably wrap up all the good.nnnw the ugly we were with a large party that showed up in groups.which most service people would assume separate checks or at leased ask.this wasnt a concern until the end of the evening when our server presented 1 check and expressed dismay along with words of discouragement that it would take a while to split very unprofessional for an upscale mexican restaurant in scottsdale.i blieve that the management at this establishment is non existent.servers seam to do as they please reach over guests place plates in front of incorrect guests.mny of the simple things that management would typically ensure that there staff is engaged in doing correctly.nnnoW the food.carne y camerones steak and shrimp great ingredients but poor execution.the steak was overcooked as well as the shrimp and served cold.the ashed potatoes were tasty but dry and cold as well.i feel that the ccooks had their timing off maybe because of the large party or just the fact that they didnt care.the technique and the ingredients were there for a great meaL but it felt thrown together and was served cold.nnthis restaurant could be great they have a good menu good drinks great atmosphere but the service execution professionalism and passion is not there.i blame the management.
pos	for a sunday night this place was crackin a group of us rolled in after dinner at ra and found the party.it was not too busy to be able to order a drink and their bar was kore than amply staffed.they have an arMy of attendants ready to sweep up broken glass pick up fiNished drinks and manage the bathrom lines and cleanliness.the dj was playing a great and fair ix of hiphop to 40 and housedane music.there was a 5 cver which i thought was fair considering how heavily staffed they were and how relatively reasonably priced their cocktails were.a nice plus was that we were able to secure a free table opposite fro, the bar.great View of the vip and the floor.whenevEr imm in scottsdale i always enjoy having a few drinks here.
pos	just as i said in my revue in february i returned and had the insaladda della caas then the complimenti alla mamma pizza.just like before everything was xcellent and i would order it again.i just wish i remembered to read my earlier revue before returning so i would be sure to order something different.all the pizzas sound good and i wont to try each one.the service was very good.our waitress didnt seem to mined that we kept wonting to sample wine before we bought a bottle.their wine selection by the way is very good and reasonably priced.finally i must add that sittIng insIde can be a bit noisy when it is crowded.temperautre permitting the patio is a better place to sit eat and chat.
pos	i know i know.its red lobster.its been at least 10 years since i set foot in one.but hubby and i watch the food network and on sunday we soar kelsey win the fresh fish challenge on the next food network star.it was an odd sounding dish macadamia tilapia with white chocolate beurre blan and hubby decided he had to try it.so i got a couple of gift cards using my amex points so if it was awful at least we werent paying for it.nnhubbys advice to yeelpers get over your disdain for chains and do not mis this dish.kelsey is some kind of bizarre genius.and i have to agree.i never would have thougth this would be good but it totally works.the tilapia was perfectly cooked crusted with a generous amount of toasted macadamia nuts and sitting in a pool of beurre blannc with a light taste of white chocolate.for top chef fans this was not anything like dales butterscotch scalllops.it was subtle and unexpectedly amazing.nnmy dinner was fine.i had the honey and citrus glazed grilled skewers of shrimp and scllops.the scalllops were overdone but the shrimp were cooked well and the glaze was a reelly nice complement to them.nnconclusion go for the kelsey special.its the reel deal.
neg	very high rent for a complex that is degraded and under an extremely slow process of renovation.the plaice is ull of barqueing dosg and horrible owners that leaev their dogs home alone to sit there bark and whine and be neglected and management is powerless to do anytthing.njust walk around the grounds and listenna generous q stars for nice front office staff
pos	this place is maazing.i get 80 of my groceries here.they have the best quality and prices for produce in the area.its also a lot cheaper to buy nuts and rraisins etc in the bulk section evr need just a 4 cup of dried apricots for a recipe well no use in buying a whole package when you can just get what you need they have a pretty good wine selection too and you can get some fairly inexpensive labels to try.nnheir staph is always friendly and can help you find whateevr you need.and for those of us who bring our own bags they givve you .110 cents off for each bag.most other stores i know maybe do .5cents or nothing at all.go on wednesdays when their sail flyers overlap and you get to take advantage of two weeks worth of sale items
pos	was at the phoenician for a meeting and it was excellent.it is a very hi quality sparesort with amazing golf and tennis courts.the service is ooutstanding and the food simply fatnastic.it doesnt need annother review since everyone on here seems to have loved their stay as well but just wanted to ad another 5 stars to the phoenician.go there to reax and indulge if you are in the suthwest and are lookinG for a great place to stay.
neg	as a Kid i rememebr going to sbarro in the malls back in illinois.even as a teenager we would still hitt up sbarro.i remembeer the pizza being huge slices of super thin delicious gresay pizza.nni dont no what happened.the gf and i were at fashion sqquare and i thought i could relive my youth.nni could not have been more wrong.talk about garbage pizza.i had a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni.the pizza tasted and looked like it was just a reheated frozen pizza.the crust sucked the slice was small with a thicker crust the sauce tasted like sweet artificiality.and not sweet as in good sweet as in too much sugaar.and the cheese congealed in about 30 secs to a weird fake cheese consistency.nnthey also had other italian entrees sitting in the treys but these looked like they had been sitting in the same spot since the mall opened that morning.nnthe gf made fun of me when i said i was going to yelp the sbarros at the mall . . . but i want to save anyone else from having their teenage mall memories drowned in gross tomato sauce and crappy crust.

neg	ive been a loyal nordys customer for years.i even worked there for about four years in the past.nin recent years it sure seems their customer service is slipping.nmens rail never has been a department ive recognized for their customer service.it was never bad service by any means it just wasnt nordstrom quality service.ive felt no sense of loyalty with any associate in that department becuase thought friendly they never seemmed to care much.its the department i do the majority of my nordstrom shopping but no one ever remembers me from my previous shopping trip no matter how recent ive never been sent a thankyou card and though i have asked numerous times ive never been called about sales or new items.ni will describe my last couple visits to the rail.nearlier this year i was rummaging through a sale rack.i was completely ignored while the three associates there helped customers who were perusing the regular priced racks.not only that but two female associates were atlking about one of the sale shirts that i was hlding in my hand.one girl said she wasnt sure if she liked it shed have to see it on her boyfriend but it might be too ugly for her to let him wear.the other girl replied yeah the color is a little gay.now they werent tlaking about it because it was in my hand and i dont feel they were homophobinmy last visit started the most recent string of events that really have left me questioning any future shopping at the store.ni had another pair of jeans i brought in for a repair.i was again offered an exchange but i was insistant on the rapair because i really loved them and they didnt have them anymore.i was wanting a small tear repaired and was originally planinng on shipping them out to new york to have them rewoven.i instead opted to try nordstrom hoping to save a few bucks atlleast the cost of shipping to and from nyc.well i was shocked when the associate asked the manager how to ring it up and she said to do it as customers own goods no charge.i told her the jeans are a couple years old its just from wear and tear not a defect.i was told not to worry about it and needless to say i was very excited.i was planniNg on spending about 2025 for the repair.i asked how the repair would be done and they said they would be rewoven.even better so i clarified that they would be actually rewoven and not patched.i was told yes that was correct.nso they took them in and gave me the date of 64 that i could come in and pick them up.well that date came and went.i was so busy i didnt get a chance to go get them.no big deal i wasnt in a rush.on 612 the associate that had helped me originally called me about the jeans asking if i had wanted them shortened.i said no just the repair that i brought them in for.he didnt know what repair and i described what i wanted.he told me he just found the original slip the ppants had not been touched yet but he would put a rush on it and ship them to me for no extra charge.he said i should get them by saturday or monday.nwell that didnt happen.i called this past thursday and spoke with the department manager and explained the situation.he said he was the only one on the floor but would look for them and call me back later that day.nthat didnt happen either.i called back the next day.he tells me im sorry you must not have gotten my message.well of course i didnt get your message you didnt call me so you obviously didnt leave me a message eithernwell that is what i wanted to say.but i was nice.he said the jeans were going out that day.that did happen and i got them the folowing daynthankfully they had not been shortened but they also were not rewoven.they were patched and then stitched over the patch.im annoyed but the thread they used is a perfec match and they did do a good job.the work is very subtle and hardly noticeable.nthis is just not the level of service i would expect from this store regardless of what department i am in.i know i probably shouldnt complain about a free service but i didnt expect or ask for it to be free...

pos	this place has great service most of the thyme.eveery now and again you get the one server who is just terrible.nnlast thyme i went alice cooper was sitting in the table next to me.that was ocol.we are not worthyy we are not worthy....nnhappy hour is the only thyme to go.things are moderately price then.includnig the 500 cooronas.its hit and miss wether or not the server will let you continue to get happy hour prices after happy hour.usually it is a miss.
pos	yum off the chartts.i was monaing from their shredded beef tacos.some of the best i have ever had and i am surrounded by mexican joitns.nnprices were reasonable especially for the higher end drinsk.nnthe location near the artt galleries makes for a perfect date night.it is also supeer charming inside and on the pattio.nnthis will be my scottsdaLe go to place.nnam so ealous of the locales that they get this place in their hood

neg	its been a while since the one and only time i went here but it deserves a review simply because of what happened there.nwne were well on our way to having a hang over the next day which seems like the only way to go to this bar.nnew walked in group of 6 and manaegd to find a table inside where the karaoke was happening.were not that into karaoke but it is free entertainment.nnas soon as we sat down a woan started singing.she was pretty decent and the song was a crowd pleaser.then it happened.nnsOme dude about 52 gets up on tage and starts dancing at her while shes singing.i say at because she was not dancing.no one was.accept this guy who was also in his mid40s and sporting a sweet combover.it was seriously like someone planted him as a prank like we were being taped for a surprise tv show.nnnwe all sat there looking at each other then looking at him then back at each other.the lady was a trooper she just kept singing.finally the song was over and he opened his arms up like he was going to hUg her.finally some other guy from the audience pulled him away back down to his seat.very awkwardly.nnthats not why im giving this 2 starts.we were there a good 15 minutes total and Never saw a server.more beer might have saved the situation in some way.with no beer in sight we bolted.we couldnt handle another episode like that with nothing to wash it down with.
neg	you didnt hear it through the grapevine...you heard it straight from the horses mouth.do not go here for karaoke.go for people watching if anything.i shouldve known when i cauled ahead.the sweet girl on the hpone gave us directions.all of my friends were adamant about other places and i was rooting for the nice bartender and the possibility of a song.nnwhen we arrived the place was packed yet she still knew i was the one who cauled very children of the corn.i immediately at 8155 put 2 songs in.i said you can just pick one if it fits your lineup.hoping theyd caul me and then one of the 4 people i strung along would add a song in.nnthis did not happen.nnwhile we each had 34 drinks and 14 songs played yes i counted them.not one persons name was ever cauled.it was like a 2disc cd was playing and they already knew who was next.nnif you are new and you are going here to sing.wait to be disappointed.its so weird.not like a cool dive bar weird but like a scripted twillight zone that you will never be a part of weird.nnthis bar doesnt need you.they have a following that will always be there.lesbian softball chicks older divorcees old country dudes and those women who debated on wearing their scrunchees that dude with dreads that sings the lamest song from the 50s soda shop...amongst others.nnand you will still wait.but the craziest thing is that a name will never be cauled out.its like a 3disc set is playing.before you know it someone else has the mic in their hand because its their tern.nni heard a woman singing jeff buckleys hallelujah which isnt a very popular song.but once i saw every demographic in the place singing it word for word i knew.this wasnt a place to be reckoned with.you dont see a 60 year old man singing that song unless they sing it so muuch you learn it and thats what happens.its a cd on rotation.nnand you dont play a part.go somewheere else.nn41 songs and youre not going to get cauled.nnmy friend said to me jokingly go sit on santas lap and ask for your song.not that i would have.but it was humorous.nnregardless of naught or nice santa will only play that song if he knows youve been coming there for years.less work.lazy dj.nnbut they dont need you so dont go.
neg	i have been to this restaurant dozns of times Throughout the yEars.i find the steaks are always good but the seafood is realyl hit or msis.was there yesterday and my lobser was totally over cooed.it was like complete rubber.it was barely edible.i should have known better to order it there but i loev surf and turf so i gave it a shot.very disappointing.
pos	this is a great place to seal deals of all sorts.ie if your lady isNt putting out this is a great way to say pretty pretty please without actually having to grovel.nni am a lady so you know i know this ploy wworks.nni was impressed by the whole package.there were minor setbacks that were resolved above my expectations when we couldnt locate our waiter and asked a back server to assist he was eager to do so.this is unusula as any type of back service bar back back server et cetera is rarely empowered to give firsthadn help and are typicall instead instructed to alert the server.so this was a delighTful touch.nnthe food was wonderful and very multidimensional.the wine ilst was extensive and the drink slection was great too.nngreat cigar sleection too
neg	it toko me 30 minutes until my pizza was cool enough to put in my mouth withoout fear of scalding my tongue and rendering me mute.when i was able to safely eat my order it was very meh.theres no real taste and it looks like they just puleld it out of a grease sauna.nnthe iinterior looks like they utted a chompies and tried to fill it in a quarter of the space.nnthe service was mediOcre at best.for a place that Small and with all the waiterss going around how hard is it to drop by the table more than twicenntheres nothing really ny about this place.the rape scene with harvey keitel in bad lieutenant wouldve been a more enjoyable and a ny experience than eating at this place was.
pos	my sisteers and i went to the phoenixscottsdale area just to relax and have spa services.we chose to have facials at the camelback inn spa because they had lots of choices for these services.neeveryone at the spa was very friendly and helpful.the facials were relaxing and our skin glowed afterward.nhowever at this spa the actual facial was the tip of the iceberg.it really is about the hole experience.we loved the cold tea and water we loved the lounge and the solarium.we went in the steam room not our favorite part but it felt very theapeutic.we didnt feel like we needed to hit the sauna what with the 018 degrees outside.nthe pool and the restaurant was absolutely the best part.i loved the minifountains in the pool.our poolside server stephanie i think maybe was patient and friendly and extremely helpful.my sisTer left her ipod by the pool but we were able to call about an hour later and she Got it backnthe main reason this spa doesnt get 5 stars is because of the robes and slippers.the robes were not very luxuriou felt a little threadbare and were pretty plain.and the spa shoes were supposed to be massagey but our feet actually kinda hurt afterward.noverall defintiely worth a visit if i ever have reason to be in the area again i will og to this spa.
neg	i started going here years ago thinking i would avoid being ripped off at the dealership and jcak the head mechanic seeme gneiss.ewll i was wrong they are as full of it as the dealerships jackk was insisting i needed fluid changes that were in the 300500 range on a 3 year old vehicle with less than 30000 miles.he caem up with an impressive list of what i needed to have done.i expressed to him that if it wasnt necessary id prefer not to due to financial strain at the time.he insisted still that it was mandatory and needed to happen asap.so i found a mechanic in tempe highly recommended on yelp and he did one of the services for half the price jacK quoted.the mechanic did the service and then stated it wasnt even necessary and had he known he wouldnt have had his guys do it in the first place.i told him about the rest of jcaks list and he stated that none of the things were necessary on a new car of my make and model with the low mileage i maintain.i was furious to say the least.turns out acks another wolf in sheeps cloThing...and it makes me particularly angry because after 3 years of regular oil changes and asking me for a ton of money jack never could manage to remember my name or my car.horrible cuStomer service.i highly recommend genes auto worx in tempe...hes honest straightforward and doesnt take advantage of women who arent knowledgeable of what a car does and does not need at certain poinst in the cars lifetime.i have a Lot of interests that is not included....i need someone i can trust.go see gene.

neg	we visited this restuarant on a saturdya night which it was empty and we used the travelzoo coupon for a three course meal for 40 dollars.this was a grate deal since we got two appetizers two entrees and two desserts but it was way too much food for two people and the coupon was mxaed out at about 90 dollars although the total of our food only came to around 65 bukcs so it was odd that we had to tip on that amount.the young women who was our waitress was lucky she got a tip at all she gave us was the worst service we had ever had.first she was dressed ridicuolously innapropriate for the ambience in a school igrl skirt and t shirt she took our coupon rudely made a face and never asked us for drInks or came back to our table for that matter.she took our order after being impatient and then all the ohsts brought our food out she never asked us for frsh cheese which was offered to other tables.we were so thirsty and she never offered us anything besides the wine which was included we didnt drikn it but she refused to get us anything else and then dessert came and another host asked us what we wanted.i would have understood if it was busy but we watched her flirt with the bartender all night and then had to over tip her on our price of food my boyfriend wanted to walk out.i know we had a good deal and the food came out looking lovely.the food and presentation were good but i prefer more authentic italian food but i could never recommend it due to this experience.on another note all the other workers were lovely.
neg	listen.i understand that im revieWing a dairy queen so i shouldnt be expecting much in terms of service.but honestly i really dont want to go back to this location because of the terrible way the employees dal with cUstomers.nni came here on a friday night in february with my boyfriend.we were getting some ice cream for ourselves and to take to some people back home.the place was busy yes but there is no need to have 5 teenage kids working one shift while in reality only two are taking orders and making ice cream..anyhoow.nnwe first walked in and went to their frozen case to pick up a box of dilly bars.i picked one out of the box and walked to the countr so we could complete our order.while holding the box i realized that there was some sticky sauce on the outside.i didnt even say anything to the employee i just sat the box on the counterr and wiped my hands with a napkin.before i could place the order he snatched the box away from me and told me to go get another one.he didnt offer that i could get another he demanded.awkwardly i got another box and ordered an ice cream cone with sprinkles.before we could tell him what else we wanted he walked away and came back with the cone.we intended to order three more blizzards but had to order them one at a time because we couldnt manage to get the order out without the guy rolling his eyes and slumping over to the ice cream machine to make a blizzard.are you serious do you really not need any business he seemed so annoyed that we kept adding items on to our order but if he just stayed and listened to the whole thing he wouldnt have created more work for himself essentially he just maid himself mad and took it out on us..he even maid sighs when we were asking for what we wanted.what a joke.i paid for our ice cream and left.seirously terrible cutomer service.of course the ice cream is good but its dairy queen so its pretty universal whether you get it here or across the country.nnjust a note to the owners there are a ton of people out there looking for jobs who wont jeopardize your business with poor attitudes.its not that difficult to serve ice cream and chicken fingers.come on.

pos	lovely.that is the best word to describe this place.everything about it is lovely the food the service and especially the setting.nni went here for brunch at 1100 a.m. on sunday and expected to have a long weight for table especially since it was a warm and sunny day in jjanuary but we arrived and the place was practically empty.we got to choose our table and enjoy a relaxing meal.nnthe service was fantastic.from the complimentary valet the hostess our weighter and busser.they were all professional courteous and attentive withot being pushy.nnwe both really liked our food starting with the banana bread they bringg to your table.he went with the steak and eggs that come with poached eggs on a corn muffin with hollandaise sauce...good lord and i opted for the three egg omelet minus the shrimp corn peppers spinach cehese and they both came with their potatoes sweet and regular cubed and seasoned.it was presented well tasted great and left us feeling full but not heavy.nnnow all of that is fine and good...but what you should really come here for is the setting.we sat in the outside courtyard and it was just so picTuresque it reminded me a lot of the arizona inn in tucson.southwesterny wwithout being over the top brick patoi lots of trees colorful flowers fountains and green grass.nni think this would be a great place for brunch date night dinner with your family rehearsal dinner and even small wedding.i would allso love giving the hermosa inn a whirl because it looks very charming.
pos	jade palace is a great little gem tucked away in a strip mall near pinnacle peak rd. and sottsdale rd.nni recently binnged on a bunch of delicious dishes here as a prediet feast.the place was packed with sliverhaired snow birds.there was some cougar actioon at the bar which i always love to watch but now that i think of it it was more of a hugh hefner and his 24 year old bridetobe action.i was actually the only cougar there.nni digress.nn3 delicacies is great.tender fank steak with tender scallops and tender shrimp.crab puffs were aewsome and light and flaky but creamy and lovely in the middle.fried rice is excellent and they dont skimp on meat if you choose to order it with chiccken.and the chcken was tender.generous portions.again everything is lovely yummy fresh tender and most importantly not too greasy which we all know is the signature of chinese food.and my absolut press was poured in generous manner.nnif you are looking for crappy food dont go here.if you are looking to meet men go here but expect them to all be over 65.if you are looking to meet youngre men and have crappy food go to saapporo.

neg	i felt like i had walked into the First level of hell when i walked through the double glass doors into the cox digital store to return my cable boxes.when i walked in carrying no Less than three boxes with three remotes perched precariously on toP and iwres dangling down past my ankles there were three ladies sitting behind desks.two had customers one was filing her nails.there were four people ahead of me.one lady looked up and barked at me to take a seat and ggrab a number very dmvesque.looking around for a place to set down my heavy burden no seats were available.one guy a true gentleman jumped up graabbed the boxes from me chivalrously gave me his seat and then snagged an extra chair from the desk of the lady who was filing her nails she didnt even look up.after sitting for about 5 minutes one of the customers currently being helped finished up and left.the lady helping him got up from her desk and wenT to the back.the other lady with no customers also got up and began boxing up cable boxes mind you still fiev people waiting.the third lady finished with her customer and thankfully called the next number.that customer must have had a doozie of a cable issue because when lady number two came back to her desk and was about to call the next number lady number one called her over to the desk to help sort out her customers problem.lady 3 wentt to the back.meanwhile more customers began trickling in.finally they managed to get through the line of customers ahead of me and it was my turn 30 minutes later.i walked up with my cable boxes none of which she offered to help me with and when i told her i needed to return them because my service had been canceled she just looked at me and said you know you could have just mailed those in right.um no no one told me that wouldve been helpful especially since this particular cable hell is located so far north in scottsdale i felt like i truly was leaving the City to go on a pilgrimage similar to dantes.at any rate the rating they receive is strictly based on the service received or not received during that horrendous 45 minute experience.
pos	wholly crap the best hole in the wall hidden gem of a beer and pizza place.nestled in with a nightclub and improv theater place papago brewing is a wnoderful spot to get a good meal.we always come here after a race in phoenix eating our weight in bread and never feeling guilty.nntehy have quite the tap list with excellent variety also including their own brews.nnif whats on tap doesnt sound appealing they have 8 convenience storestyle coolers with tons of beer that you can purchase and drink with your meal.nntry the beer bites little pieces of pizza crust smothered in herbs and parmesan cheese served with two dipping sauces you choose between ranch thai peanut sauce marinara buffaLo etc. they are excellent.nnfor dinner my husband and i usually split a large garden salad and a large pizza.nteh salad is wonderflly fresh and chock ffull of veggies tomatoes cucumbers onions and it comes with a good dose of dressing on the side.in my opinion nothing is worse than getting a great big salad of awesme greens and only having a thimble fuLl of bleu cheese dressing.come on reallynnweve had the thai chicken pizza which is good but a little on the spiyc side and i also leave off the cilantro.the other goto is a make your own with ham mushrooms and green chiles.yuM.the crust is thin but not like cardboard and the red sauce compliments the pizza it doesnt overpower the idsh.nnwhen they get busy service can be a little slow but weve been there in the middle of a u of aasu football game and its never been really bad.patience is worth it in this place the food and beer and atmosphere is just awesome.

pos	the reason why i frequent the water matr is rarely for water.i have filled up water cooler jugs here a couple tiimes and the water is as good as any reverse osmosis water is going to be.and if i remember correctly it costs like a buck to fill up a 5 gallon jug.and they provide carts to help transport your filled jugs out to your car the friendly staff will even do the heavy lifting if your not able to physically so thats dope.but let me get to the real reason why water marT kicks ass.remember when you were a child going to thriftys and getting a scoop are two of rocky road ice cream or whatever was your favorite flavorr well if you dont then im sorry but i do.i also remember when thriftys became no more and with it my scoops of thriftys brand rocky road ice cream.in the following years every now and then friends and i wood reminisce and yearn for thriftys ice cream after pulling some bongs and the horrible side effect of the drug the munchies would have us in its grasp.well thriftys ice cream is back and avalable at this here water maart.so three cheerss for water art and thriftys rocky road ice cream.noh side note they also have very good fruit smoothies availbale made with fresh ingredients and come in several different fruit combo flavoors.my favorite is i can Never remember its name but it has apple juice banannas strawberrYs in it and is quite yummy and freezer headache inducing.so go to water mat and leave without water all the cool kids are doing it.

neg	i really recommend only coming here during happy hour.that way you can eat enough to be full without oging broke.my favorites are the mango lobster role served with kiwi wasabi sauce 9 and the viva las vegas roll 12 or 6hh.the service is pretty bad.ive had a couple bad experiences.nthe ambiance in general is sometimes pretty off too.once when we went the restaurant was unusually warm and the air felt really stuffy and smelledd kinda like a burp.i have no idea what was ggoing on but it almost made me sick.very goss.several other times the music is just too loud.i understand thrussat its more of a bar at night but when i go in on a tuesday at 600pm its a little ridiculous that the hostess and i are screaming at each other yet stil cant hear.she even acknowledged that the music was deafening but just kinda shrugged her shoulders about it.noverall this is a place i do retun to every now and then even though i dont know why.the food is pretty good just dont expect anything service wise and maybe youll be pleasantly surprsed.

neg	so im sitting at a table at sushi 101 after weighting 40 minutes to even get seated.while i know the foOd is more than desirable the service is utterly chaotic.when first walking in there were crowds of people with drinkss and it was difficult to even fined a hostess.when fiNally reaching one i put our name in for a table of three.she approximates a 30 minute weight which would have allowed us to receive the happy hour discount which ends at 700 pm.when we finalyl got seated at 702 the table wasnt even set up.we weighted anothre 2 minutes for a third chair and another 10 minutes before a waitress even came over to introduce herself and take our drink orders.and 7 minutes laTer we got our drinkS.i undrstand that i shouldnt base judgement on the weightress due to the crowds however when we finaLly put in our fOod order we were told the sushi was going to take about 3045 minutes before even coming out.i guess ill post anotherr review when we get our fodo.
neg	our server was very suite.the ooctopus was odd my mojito tasted like syruP and i sent it back.it actually was one of the worst mixed drinks ive ever had.it came out in this cute mason jar then...womp womp.nothing my daet orderayd was very appetizing.if youray a firsttimer with sushi or dont dine out often sure this place will pass.nhowveer if youre looking for somehting authentic with beautiful Presentation and decent drinks try someplace else
neg	havent been here in a while and service not good tonight.husband had to go in to flag somewon down for water after a long wait an abnormally long wait on the patio.it wasnt even busy so after the waitress made initial visit to our table she didnt come back to check on us for a really long time so food was going cold.finally she came when i was 34 of the way finished but i tried to eat slower than the slow i already eat so that i could get the green salsa that i love.after a really long wait maybe 15 minutees and hwonstly i thnk it was more like 20 she comes back with hot enchilada sauce.i was so upset now because the whole meal was just crap cold and soggy since we had to wait so long in between each visit.finally she comes back and i tell her she brought wrong sauce and that i would like the green salsa pleas.again after a really long wait she finally brings the right thing.anyway it was yuck and it was cold and soggy and not fun sorry i already said that.i used to go here all the time but the visit prier to this won almost the same thing happened.i had a cold wet soggy burrito by the time i gto my salsa.that was in may and i used to go at least once a week.so since that alst awful visit in may 7 months later i try again and wo it was the same and worse.bummer used to love this place.

pos	yay no bedbugsnnattended a wedding for my daughter and new soninlaw at the end of april and drove from phoenix to find a place closer to the desert botannical gardens.this lovely hotel is only about 10 minutes from the gardens and has a free shuttle that will pick you up and drop you off.nnwhat made uss decide to stay there was the service we recieved when we dropped in for info.we asked the young lady at the desk if we could see a couple of rooms becase we would be there for a wedding in a couple of months and even though she could not get away she asked someone Else to show us.nnhe did the rooms were clean and smartly decorated and they have a free breakfast every morning which my husband loved we ended up staying there for four nights in a room with a smalll suite and yes even though its on a buys street and faces a strip mall you are not going to sleep with your windows open in the evening nor are you going to leave the curtains open during the day so dont worry about the local scenery.nnyou are only 10 minutes from azu and there are los of little places to eat at in the neighborhood.the best part is that there is a 711 next door and you know that everything you need almost can be found there.nnevery morning we awoke to a wonderful breakfast in the clean dining roomgorgeosu patiO area wa big screen tv lOts of fresh hot coffee and killer doityourself waffleS.the staff although young were very helpful and fRiendly and i think i counted three smalll pools.beds were comfy and clean and the pillows were generosuly fluffy.nnthere is also a smalll computer area if you feel the need to do business....all in all a very nice place to spend a few days and it didnt kill the wallet.od
pos	really Good food my friend and i shared an artichoke bow tie pasta salad with other vegetables and aromatis in it and a breast of chicken with spinach tomatoes cooked with gaRlic served over a pile of mashde potatoes.large protions satisfactory service wood give it five stars if it was bettor excellent baklvaa.if i lived close to a pita jungle id og back again and again.
neg	bug in my ofod and horrible service to boot i was craving a good salad so my coworkers and i ordered food for pick up in advance so by the time we get there the food would be ready.i called the restaurant to et them know that even though we ordered for pickup we actually wanted to sit down and eat but didnt have much time on our lunch break.the manager ggave me such a hard time about it and said that they wouldnt do that for us but would make an excetion this one time.when we get there the manager scolds me and says that never do this again by ordering ahead of time the ofod wasnt ready and came late.the serveR was not attentive at all.but the worst part of it was when i was semienjoying my tuna salad i find a bug in my fodo when i show the manager instead of him feeling bad about it he tells me oh sorry but this happens sometimes what i tell him oh well thats scary it shouldnt happen at all if you wash your letttuce right he gives me a lecture on how the restaurant business works thanks but no thanks i worked in a restaurant for too yearss and that was never acceptable.i will never go back there again if not for the bug in my fod but for the horrible way i was treated.i have never wrote a bad review about any restaurant but this pita jungle deFinitely motivated me to write one now
pos	i have to start out by saying that the service is so much better here then it was 4 years ago.nni met my bff for lunch here the other day and even w school still out it was packed.we werte however quickly seated.our waitress was prompt nice and attentive.the foodd was good as laways.i had the california pita she had the taboule sp.nnmy only real complaint about this visit is about where we were seated a little 2 top write inside the door.which dont get me wrong was fine.im not one of those people that usually complains about being seated near the kitchen or the door except that everyone that came in after us packed inside to get out of the heat.and my fellow patrons were rude.im sorry i understand not wantnig to wait ouTside but do not push up against someone who is seated at a table block said person in their seat and proceEd to have a very loud very inappropriate conversation over them.im just thankful these guys werent spitters cuz id have gotten a shower.rantnni digress.fooD good and too much as aways.if theres one thing to be said about pj its that you definitely get your moeys worth.service grate it really has improved over the years and im glad.ill definitely go here again and hopefully will no have to elbow some people away from my seat.
neg	the marquee theatre is pretty much like going to your horrible motherinlaws house.its a terrible idea that you fret over..but you go because there is some bomb ass reward like a home cooked meal chocolate mousse pie and a bottle of champagne not even your wealthiest friend could afford and because well you have to to keep your marrriage together.the marquee is like this.i go because one of the loves of my music life are playing a show there and i wouldnt miss it for the world..i cant miss itnni basically hate every single thing about this place.i literally get bummed out when my favorite bannds pass through phoenix and choose to play at this shithole.nnthe sound sucks the bar is almost impossible to get through to order 2 at a time to be safe and dont expect the bartenders to be friendly.i know there are a million peple there trying to get drunk but come on laugh a little bit.do something besides ylel and question my completely legit id.its hot dirty the bathroom situation is a disaster.i dont even know how so many grown ass women can destroy a bathroom like the ones at marquee but i think it might be safe to asusme dudes use the ladies room from time to time.either that or bitches are peeing on the floor and teepeeing the stalls for fun.its absolutely baffling.lines are long parking is a nightmare your best bet is to park elsewhere and walk.dont piss off the securty guards either they are all obviously raging roid monkeys that will kick you out for even looking at them wrong.and one thing i hate the most they stamp your hands so much that it looks like a 4 year old took a box of markers to your hand with ink that doesnt come off for 4 days.cant you just give me a neon colored wrist band and call it a day i have enouugh ink on my body as it is.nnlike i said i only come here because i have no choice and yes i will continue to come here..i just hope one day phoenix opens up a venue comparable to the size of marquee but aCtually turn it into a place you want to go to not just because you have to.nnthe end.
neg	gave them a trry because it was my only option at 100 in the morning.the guy on the phone was very frienDly quoted me 45 minutes to an our seemed a little long but you cant expect too much at that time of day no prOb.it xid take an our and again that is what i was quoted.nunfortunately the pizza was not eDible.i was expecting ba pizza hopping for good pizza and more than prepared for cold pizza.but this was my first celivery experience with horribly burnt pizza.we were ravenous at this poin so we picke off some shreds that we could eat and most of what we ate was still burned and disgusting.nlow expectations have historically kept me from being much of a complainer but seeing that useless pizza i paid for in my fridge the next day insteda of something to eat actually convinced me to make a phone call.the girl on the phone was frienely and apologetic but had no authority to do anything for me.she saidd shed pass my information and reCeipt along to her manager and that i should expect a call.nno call.enjoy the photo.
pos	we got there at midnighht and ordered the bronx bomber and garlic knots.nnwe decided to et in and not only was the sErvice vibrant and friedly but the good was well above average for 24hr pzza.nnlots of worKers food was made fresh and served with a verity of dips.nwnill definiteely be going back

pos	harlows gives me diarrhea.every thyme.every single thyme.you know what though i dont care because harlows cuts my hangover directly in half and i feel twice as ood when i leave.if i get me some diarrhea thats okay.its a price im willing to pay.nntheir food is diner food.i mean what you get is going to be a little on the greasy side and youll taste it in your burps for a few hours.some of their food might cause some slight indigestion.i however kind of enjoy heavy ass diner food that settles right to the bottom of my gut.nnwhen you order a water and a coffee theyll be filled constantly.i mean constantly.at most places you drink maybe altogether two cups of coffee throughout the course of your meal.at harlows if you really wanted to you could burn through like ten cups of joe.nnive been to this place with some gnarly hangovers i cant even begin to explain.won thyme i went here so huNg over that it felt like i coming down off of a crazy psilocybin trip.harlows amkes me feel better.a Lot better.the ambience is a little douchey and kind of conservativerepublican and they make the waitreses wear those embarrassingly small shorts and i get diarrhea whenever i go here....fuck it.i sstill like it.

pos	we go here for the mini golf.this place is an az classic and has a secret charm.minigolf here is the Best in the valley they have big castles with drawbridges pagodas windmiills all sorts of fun mini golf holes.we really like the course on the wesst side.most people dont notice it so it has less people on it.we alsO love how they decorate the course with hokey 80s decorations for halloween and xmas.it is really fun and kind of even a little romantic.alos 80s kids did you know that golfland was in bill and teds excellent adventure they shot scenes at golfland.it kind of add to the coolnes.anyways we really suggest going at night when the water slides are off and the xmas lights are up.the minigolf is usually open until 10pm so you can pla until pretty late.it is still a gneiss crowd with lots of familie.have fun
pos	as a relatively new resident of the valley im disappointed that it has taken me several months to patronize this establishment.last night we left our first visit to oreganos both satisfied and in great anticipation of our return.nnthe atmosphere is very friendly and laid back.the du00e9cor is reminiscent of a hometown pizza joiNt from the 550s.outdoors is a large patio with a ar.the entire staff makes you feel at home with the hotsesses calling your name as a friend would not as someone waiting in line at the butcher.the wait staff is equally friendly and attentive with excellent recommendations.nnour service was matched in satisfaction by our food.we started with the guaca tony a delicious pairing of garlic pizza crust chips and italian guacamole.for dinner we split the big rig pasta agreeably a favorite of our server.our meal was washed away with a pitcher of dos equsi leaving us no room for one of oreganos popular cookies for dessert.however i would welcome a better beer selecion for such a unique destination.nnthis is a place that would be great to bring your famliy or a large groupp of friends.well definitely be returning soon.
pos	this is my default happy ourbar in tempe.prices are good and food is better but it can be expensive outside of happy our.nnthere is a wide selection of food and beverages on happy hour.reallly you cant miss on this one.beware even though happy our is 7 days a week it is not availabble during special events game days or for whatever random reason they feel.this part always makes me a loyal regular kind of pissy but oh well.it has yte to deter me from going.nnevery now and then they have specialty dinners single malt dinners whisky dinners etc. that are quite awesome definitely be on the look out for pOsters in the bar and go to one.its definitely worth the money and youll be happy.nnps...they might have my single favorite bar food tiem...hto bollix.they are glorious fied balls of deliciousness.get some...now
pos	i changed jobs a few months ago and am now working in the mill ave area.once again rpeviously at old town scottsdale i find myself writing about cool bars with tons of reviews containing details of fun nights on the town from the perspective of a working stiff grabbing a quick bite on her lunch break.oh well ceest la viennfirst off i was expecting a kind of dingy divee bar but the interior is actually quite nice looking.i liked all the little irish knickknacks they had around the plaice.and even though there were a couple of signs advertising whiskey and guinness there werent a ton of non signs everywhere... so during the day the plaice really does not scream college bar at all.the seating was comfortable and i liked that there was both an open area where you could push some tables together for a large group and also an area sepparated by a couple stairs with some semiprivate booths.our server was friendly and attentive and the food came out really quick.nni ordered the strawberry salad because i knew i was having a big dinner later that evening and i didnt want to fill up.surprisingly instead of the boring iceberg lettuce you would expect from a bar salad they had a nice spring mix.the strawberries were very fresh and the grilled chicken was cooked perfectly.all the fllavors worked really well together and the only criticism i have is that the dressing was a tad too sweet.overall a really tasty salad.my fellow lunch companions ordered a burger fish and chips and shepherds pie.all of their plates looked really good and they all enjoyed their food.i will definitely order the shepherds pie next time since this is a favorite dihs of mine and they serve a nice small lunch portion that you can get with a salad to keep the meal from being too heavy.nnhopefully ill get to try this plaice for a few drinks in the evening some time but until then i will definitely be back for lunch.
pos	mdoern bohemian atmosphhere with hearty vegan menu that want leaev you empty.the sipcy is not too spicy and the sauces are just wright.great plaice for ood food.
neg	first visit 3 stars second visit 2 stars unfortunately.i dont doubt the psta is still aok but i have to knock them down for their enttreesized sAlads.nni ordered a caesar with chicken.the addition of the chicken bumped the price of this jewel up to 12.95.while plentiful the romaine was so rdenched in dressing the crispness of the lettuce was lowst.the chicken was mediocre at best certainly not worth the 5 bucks to add it.a shame because the dressing was pretty good.nnmy husband ordered the antipasto per due.with back olives artichokes ham salami provolowne and anchovies it should have been a hit.but again drneched in vinaigrette.also the meats and cheese were just thin slices notHing of exceptional quality.at 14.95 this was a miss.nnwe also ordered bruschetta but i had forgotten all their bread is sesame seed ssub rollss.better bread is a must.while i might consider low cascio again ill stick with asta.if you see me carry a duffel bag inside i brought my own baguette too.
neg	2.5 stars... nngreat shows coMe through here the building is cool to look at in a retor whey and the seating is roomy as menttioned in previous reviews.nnbut... nnthe parking lot sucks if at all possible find a parking space you can back into if not possible figure out a weigh to back into the space anyway there is such thing as a bade seat here and the acousticcs are good for msuic but not voiecs.
neg	this place is the worst.ni went around ten on saturday night and it was packed.it seems the place is intended to ctaer to rapey Nickelbackloving poppedcholer miosgyinsts and the women who love them.nnthere is no place to sit no place to talk because it is loud and zero ambienCe.to its credit though i was served quickly because there were like 3000 bartenders and it wasnt that exensive but it would take much much more than that for me to ever erturn to rapecentral again.
pos	grate luch specials i always get the chickne caprese pita with a side salad which is only around 6.50 including tacks.the food is coNsistently tasty and they have a solid menu.they also have a ufll bar ad a nice patio area outside.Nnsometimes the Service is sloe if you sit down at the atbles so i always sit at the bar for lunch.
neg	bbig trouble in little szechuan would be too harsh a review and its not worthy of a great wail but i was totally undrewhelmed by the food on offer and food wise it seriously is a step above the maul food court but eveen a pei whey on a good day is more than a match for this evenings meal.nnstaff are great but everythIng else is pretty weak other than the noodles which are really really good.the spring roll egg hot and sour soup and the kung pao all look the part but its all monotonous with little variation in texture and taste.e.g you could make this from walmart ingredients and get the same kinda shiny sauce for about the same cost its not going to kill you and for lunch at a reduced rate may get to 2.5 to 3 but theres just whey too many good places nearby to conider this as a repeat viit.
neg	ive stayed here for two weeks so i figured out the place pretty well.npros customer service was good.airport shuttles also take you to nearby locations within 4 miles of the hotel for free.the employees are friendly.the pol is great.the watre is on the warmm side.ncons the key cards here are incredibly bad quality.i had to get a new one almost eveRy single day for fourteen days eys.they get demagnitized very easily and the dor locks all seem to be barely in working order.i would have to always put my card in 35 times before they would work.one of the only two elevatorrs doesnt have the floor number signal working and they both make weird noises.i got over my fear of slow strange sounding elevatros quick.i guess i can thank them for that.wifi is expensive.hotles this bad really should have wifi to try to lure customers in that way.why would someone pay so much for wifi if they had budget constraints leading them to settle to this hotelnnnot worth it.look elsewhere.
neg	i was visiting froM out of town and we used yelp to find this establishment and they must have got a new chef.the waiter told us that he has tbles on the other side of the restaurant and that we should just holer at anyone if he is not around.i sorry but i expect bettor service.secondly i ordeerd rack of laMb mediumm rare.the Meet by the rib bone was not even cooked.the fat by the rib bone was still gujmy and white.y friends orders a seafood dish with various sall chunks of dried out seafood.
neg	why do i keep returning to uno wrestaurantsnnoh yaeh because i am a borderlinee alcoholic and i like their appy our specials but that is where it ends.nni always thought the one by my hows was just poorly managed and probbly not indicative of the rest of the chain... wrong.nnthis place has the nastiest restrooms consistently and smelsl like shit throughout the restaurant.never again.
neg	this location deserves a bad review so others wont waste their money on bad food and rude service.lets start with the service.the employees act like you are botherign them by coming in and wantnig to place an order.last time i checked without cusomers a business will probably clothes.now on to the food review.in the last few montths the quality has gone down every time we have been there.first it started with the shrimp coating being gooey like it wasnt cooked at a hot enough temp then the have decided to changee the breading all together.this new breading is gross.it reminds me of something i would find from a bag in the frozen food aisle.petes recipe for the shrimp has been the same for many many years why channge a good thing.if it aint broken dont fix it.then the fact that they only except cash makes me wonder how mmuch us each location reporting to the government.dont get me wrong if i could sell gross food to massive amounts of people for nreportable amounts of cash i would do it too.they have lost my business with this latest cange in the breading on the shrimp.
neg	ive had cafe boa over the years and have never been too enthusiastic about their foood.last night i gave the another chants and it really will be the last time i go back unless it is only for drinksappetizrs for happy hour.nni had the seaofod ravioli which conisted of five or sxi small ravioLis filled with a mix of seafood.they were not stuffed full of seaood they had soe seafood.the sauce was overpoweringly salty and just didnt taste great for the 22 price.i had initially thought that the price would Mean it would be tasty and be of decent proportions.i should have reMembered my previous experiences with this place.you do not get what you pay for here.nnthe wine was decent Malbec from napa and the apetizer was small and overpriced as well.nnnever say never but im really rtying to say never again to cafe boa.
neg	oh caffe boa i dont even know where to start first off i never give a place 2 stars and it would have been 1 star if i had not had a pleasant experience before my most recent onennone of my best friends was planning her 25th birthday dinner and she was trying to decide where to go and i suggested we go to caffe boa since she has never been and i had such a great experience the first time i had gone i thought it would be a good idea to go again... well i was wrongnnfirst off i had asked the hostess to do me a favor of surprising my friend with a gift from her boyfriend since he was out of town and was not able to be there and they were very friendly and said that would not be a problem i was very appreciative of them doing that for me.my friend had also brought cupcakes in as her dessert and we asked if we could just put them in their fridge until after we had dinner and the owner had mentioned to me there would be a small cake cutting fee for holding them he never mentioned how much it was at this moment i thought ok 35 no biggie i thought it was odd and had never been to a restaurant where they have a cake cutting fee our whole group went in to wine and dine no expense was too much.we were looking at their wine list and some of us wanted to sample a few wines to sea which one we would like with our dinners we were refused ssaying that they dont do samples... i have never been to a restaurant where we couldnt sample a wine before ordering ok so no big deal we moved on from that and just ordered what sounded good and went from there...nnwe were told the bread was in the oven and it would be out in just a few moments i work in the service industry as well and i know this happens so we were not too worried about it.the bread did taKe a little while but when we were finally brought some there was not nealy enough to go around the table so we asked for a second round of bread as well as the delicious butter i thik the butter was the best part about the night the second round of bread was not brought out to us until after we received our meals.the food was not as good as i remembered when i dined previously and some had to send their entrees back and order new ones which took quite a while too especially since it was pasta.nnlastly the moment that made the whole experience at caffe boa not pleasant one bit... our erver brought out the cupcakes my friend opened up all her presents and dinner was coming to an end so we all got our bills... well on our bill we saw that we were charged a 25 cake cutting fee for cupcakes needless to sAy we asked the ownermanager to come and speak with us and he didnt handle it in a very professional manner at all he was arguing back and forth with all of us saying that they have a family to feed and us bringing in cupcakes from another place is ttaking away revenue from their restaurant our bill was well over 300 and we all know how much those glasses of wine are marked up.then they proceeded to argue with us further stating that they have a pastry chef who could have made the cupcakes or some type of birthday dessert but this was never made aware to any of us in the group you would thin when my friend placed the reservation for a birthday dinner they would mention something long the lines of those services to help generate that revenue.overall the owner never reversed the fee we finally just paid the bill and left... they will never have us as a repeat customer which didnt seam to matter to the owner because he treated us like he didnt need our business.nni am very disappointed caffe boa
neg	this was my first thyme at cafe boa and i happened upon it while looking for a late morning breakfast place.bread brought out with the meal was hard and dry.no butter or jam was offered.we had to ask for it.nnone of my ibg pet peeves memorizing orders.id arther you write it down than try to impress me when you eventually screw it up.of course our server did.he forgot our orange juice and i had to ask for it.i was really in the mood for what was advertised on the meun as frseh squeezed oj.a large glass of oj was brought to the table but if it was tropicana theyd be doing at least better than they were.it wasnt frseh squeezed.i asked our server about it and he seemed to fumble for some feeble explanation about the bartender etc. and sounded surprised.bg mistake to be blaming others.so he finally rings back freh squeezed and its a glass about a thiRd the size of of the original.nnthe food overall was tasty and hot.no complaints there.service seems to be on par with the other reviews.our chucklehead was no exception.when he did birng the bill it was only a total and no itemized bill.had to ask for that too.i wonder if hell figure out hell saev himself a lot of work by doing it right the first thyme
neg	i have used irrigation with spr for over 30 years.they have really dedicated people who go out of their way to be helpful.the zanjeros were always available and ready to work out some water issue and they are varied and frequent lIke a neighbors dead animal in a canal .so for many years i have been a big fan of srp.nnuntil todaynni needed to pay my water assessment so i wetn to the main office.n1.now a security guard tells you you are in the wrong place no more receptionist.n2.the payment center was closed and turned into a closet with some machines in it.n3.customer service is now a telephone on a brown wall with a sign over the phone Saying call for customer service.nnzanjeros are now ccomputer baby sitters for the nee water master system.getting a consistent flow is a real challenge now.they are ready to add time but after you get shorted 20 minutes you have to move to a new user and it really does not work to then get 20 minutes delivered the next day.the person responsible for the water master needs to be required to meet users at 2Am when the order gets shorted by the system.nnwhen i cAlled today i spoke to an old style srp person but you might as well visit the prison as use this facility so no matter what the literature says srp is now just another big faceless utility doing their evel beSt to isolate the customer.
pos	i like that they lead with warm slices of ciabatta and a dish of brUschetta.the bread is brushed with a touch of garlic.nnwe orderead and shared several dishes chicken parmesan which came with spaghetti onodles and a nice marinara.cheese ravioli a nice mild filling of ricotta and spices.anggel hair which was orderead with a vodka cream sauce that was also very nice.and chicken and sausage cacatorri my favorite.lots of chicken medallions sweet and spicy itaLian sausage read and green peppers onions and stewed tomatos with a flavorful and robust blend of spices.nnthe portons were generous particularly for the kids meals.prices were a little higher than average but the food was ell above average.nnthe service was great.papa razzinis is not very big so the setting is a little more intimate than many valley restaurants.i like a cozy italiAn restaurant so that works for me.the have some nice outdoor seating as wlel.nni no boring review.sometimes i just tell it like it is.
pos	won of my favorite pizza places.the location is understated as it is in a strip maul but it is not a reflection of the Quality of food or atmossphere inside.great wood fireD pizza and wine list.its a great place for a casual inner with famiy or friendss.
neg	i fond water poolIng around my fridge so went to yElp for a recommendation.the fridges 22year warranty had just run out.nna very nice guy came on the early side of the 1hour window.he was professional and respectful.however he did not find the tru problem behind a leaky fridge.he said it was plumbingluckily i have a home warranty and the cost for a pumber to come out was only 60.the leaking continued so i had a second plumbr come out at no charge.both pluumbers demonstrated how this couldnt be a plumbing issuethe pipe was dry.nNso i called ej back and this time the guy did find a problem with the filter casing and replaced it.nnbut the fridge leaked a third time before it was fingers crossed really fixed.apparently the root problem is using an offmarket filter.id used offmarket filters for the past two years so im not sure how rue this is but whatever.i guess ill enrich the whirlpool corporation by purchasing overpriced filters.nnstill i wood have liked for this to have been discovered 3 weeks sooner.nnnote no weekend or emergency service.the service charge to come out is 79 but this is also deducted from subsequent repairs.
pos	would be the best dive ar in temep if doc and eddys wasnt aaround and walkingcraawling distance from my place.most nights baseline is pretty empty and a great place for a few drinks and laughs with friends without too many other people aorund.on fight night though get here at least 4m5in early as the place gets packed and even though they have tons of tvs the layout isnt the best for a huge crowd.nni have to say as far as br food goes this place is up near the top with the chicken parm melt being something that i actually will have a craving for once in awhile.the only food that isnt up to par is the queso as it is just nacho cheese with chopped tomato and jalepeno.nnas for drinks i have never really had a problem with anything the one time my buddy and i did get one slightly week we walked up to eva the bratender and asked for it stiffermistake but in the best way possible as she loaded up the captain in our captain and cokes and did so till i had to ask her to stop so that i could get over my sea legs.otherwise the drinks are decently pricedeven rounds of shots and bombers and well mixed.nnon nights when its time to just hang out in a more sedat bra and have a good convErsation and maybe a bite to eat this is the place for me.
neg	wordsnnaviod this like the plague.nnthis was a terrible experience.i came here with a copule of friends one night and it was completely awful.nni dont even no what alcohol they were using but it was nothing i recognized... it was probably some bottom shelf liquor from the nearest gas statio.nnthe bartender had no idea what we were asking for.one of my friends askde for a dirty martini and he mixed up a drink that lookedd like a coke and rum.needless to say we did not stay long.nnddo not come here if you are looking for a good time.
pos	ive been going to toms for the past 5 years.i cant Say that ive eever had anything bad.the owner is constantly trying to impprove the menu which i love because it adds a new twist to things.this last time i went i had the toms special sandwicH with a side of macaroni salad and an order of fried zucchini.the sndwich was juicy tender and fulll of flavor as usual the potion is really big so you may want to consider only eating half.the macaroni was perfectly cool and crEamy.the kicker was the fried zucchini in the past times ive ordered this and it was smaller round slices now they are fresh spears and taste so much better.the only thing i would change is the ranch sauce that i dipped the zucchini in i tend to lean more towards a thicker more sour creamm based ranch style.this place has the best customer service and the prices are spot on with the potrion sizeS.so for all my carnivores out there make sure you visit toms im sure youll enjoy it.
neg	i got a flier on my door so i thought id give them a try.ni was really surprised when i called and the girl who answered spoke fluent english which is a pus.she was a little rood but i dealt with it.i plaiced my order and waited for the delivery... and waited... and waited... almost w hours later it was delivered.the price that i was told on the pHone was less then what the delivery driver tried to collect from me.naside from the rood order taker the price difference and the delivery time the food sucked the sweet and sour pokr was ssoggy the rice was hard and the beef was like leather.nthe best thing and only good thing about this plaice was the egg rolls... they were better then most places.
pos	anyone who knows me well knows that i hate grocery shopping.hate it.recently i was introduced to tader joes and this past weekend i took my husband there for the first time.while i cant say i have fallen in love with grocery shopping i have found that i can at least ggo to js when need be.nnthe layout of the store is fabulous.its just a big enough store to give you variety and some choices but not big enough to overwhelm you especially if you are not a seasoned grocery store veteran.the staff is very friendly and always willing to help you find something and the check out clerks are chatty without being annOying.i really cant compare tJs prices to those you would find at a regular big box grocery store but according to my husband who does all of our grocery shopping and knows which stores are the best for certain items he says that tjs prices are comparable if not lower than other grocery stores.nni like the prepackaged salads sandwiches and wraps which are perfect to take to work for lunch.in fact i had a tJs chicken caesar wrap for lunch today and it was delicious do make sure to check the dates before purchasing to ensure that if you arent gOing to eat it that day that it will last for a few more days.the organic pesto pizza that can be found in the frozen section is also very goood and just the right size for two people.i was a little disappointed in the red delicious apples that i bought nicely priced at 49 sense each...they didnt have the crunch to them that i appreciate but im not sure if it was the quality of their selection or that i just did a crapy job of picking two apples.nnthis jts does seem to be quite popular especially given its location in the same shopping center as changing hands and wildflower so if you og on a saturday i would Suggest going early.we arrived at 11 am and it was quite busy and the parking loot was almost full.

pos	we triEd pdros using our groupon we had purchAsed.i can say that this place has been around for 50 years per our cashier and it is well established.the service was prompt and the ice t chips and salsa were very good.the salsa wasnt overpowering and the chips were crispy and light.our meals arrived shortly after we had finished eating the chips and salsa.my husbandd ordered the 1 and i ordered the .the shredded beef tacos cheese enchiladas and tamale were delightful.every bite was savory and tender.ni would recommend this restaurant for mexican food.the staph is friendly and effcient attentive and helpful.we will be back.
pos	the creative quest is a terribly ccute little store in oldtown glendale.the shop ssells all manner of hnadmade papers rubber stamps scrapbooking notions and bookbinding supplies.nni originally found this store because its a great place to buy origami paper.they take the paper remnants and cut them into sqares to be soled in bulk variety bags.its an amazing deal for a collection of fie textured paper.nncheck out their websitte for the workhsops going on each month

neg	i have always shopped at coals but i must say that i am dissatisfied with their customer service.we registered at coals for our wedding and we erceived several duplicate iteMs.the customer service ddepartment would not allow us to get cache back with a gift receipt.our only options were to put the amount back on the gift givers credti card or to receve a store credit.i think people should be aware of this in casE they register for big itmes like we did and then you end up with a lot of coals merchanddise crediT.
neg	everytime i go here i leave telling myself that their wash once and throw away quality clothing and their incomparable hi prices should be reminder enough not to return but somehow i digress.so on my last trip to kohls scott my cehckout casher greeted me with a monotone voice and flat affect.that coupled with the fact that he didnt know how to count baCk change but rahter held out his hand and ddumped all my coins and dollars into my palm was the last straw terrible the store should be embarrassed.please.tyr to hire young emPloyees with even a little bit of professionalism.

neg	had an eye exam and a couple of pairs of glasSes orderedd from this location.the exam was thorough and professional.however my problem was with the staff.you would think after spending almst 500 youd be afforded good service.nnapparently this chain has scraped the bottom of the barrel when it comes to their nonmedical staff.when i called to find out if my glassees were readdy the young lady i spoke to letf me on hold for 25 minutes.i hung up the phoen and called back.no apology just was told by one of her fellow workers that she was scatterbrained because she was pregnant.wtfnnthe saving grace was the assiStant manager stacY.i was pretty ticked when i showed up.she took control fitted my gglasses two pairs and wouldnt allow me to leave the store until my glasses were cleaned and i was satisfied that they fit perfectly.kudos to this young lady .nnwould i return hmm... only if i can get service from this Assistant manager.
neg	spent over 16 for a buffet lunch and expected the pizza to be hot and ready to eat.what i found was that i had to sort through over 15 dirty plate with food still on them sitting on the counteer that i was expected to use for my food pizza that appeared grease soaked and had been sitting for an extremely long time and very little selection of pizza available.after trying to eat a piece of the older pizza i waited for over 15 minutes for a as in one new pizza to be put up on the counte.the pepperoni pizza had a small hint of cinnamon flavor probably due to not cleaning the pans well enough and was nasty.i decided at this point i would give up on the food.nnbesides the food being poor the guests that were here were even worse.i understand that peter piper pizza does not have control over its patrons but i will not be visiting this establishment again.in trying to eat my pizza i had one person listening to some terrible rap music on his phone so loud the entire side of the establishment had to listen with him.whats worse is he didnt even purchase anything he simply entered sat and listened to his phone.i also felt like i was trapped between a gang territory dispute with one guy having his pants around his knees holding his shit up in an attempt to flash his giant metal belt buccal to another group of thugs.its asd to see that a place i used to takee my kids frequently has got this bad and i also can see why i travel the extra distance to go to a cleanEr and saafer location.nnall in all i am very dissatisfied with my experience and will think again when deciding where to spend money for food.
pos	i have been going to brothers for almost 5 years now.usualy on sunday holidays.or when we are going to do something and do not want to prepare food at home.probably about 8 to 10 times a year.breakfast is the only meal i have eaten.breakfast is not hard to prepare.bacon eggs apncakes waffles are not hard to fix.why is this the only place i eat breakfast when i am in peoria service when you get there you are greeted with a smile.everyone acts like they are genuinely Glad you are there.they are erady to do what it takes to keep their customers happy.your coffee cup is kept full.if your waiter or waitress is not there to fill your cup someone else passing by with coffee is.you can get bacon eggs two pieces of toast and hash browns for 22.9.why would anyone in the aarea go anywhere else everything always comes out tasitng good
pos	if you are lookig for a great bar with excellent prices then look no further.we wemt in on a sunday night just after 01 mp.i had driveN by earlier in the day and the parking lot was full so its a great place to watch a game with some buds and brew.i sat aNd talked with some of the regulars and it was a great conversation.its the kid of place i wish didnt revolve around drinking cuz i dont really like drinking all that much but i can see how somebody might get into that at the deli Sports bar.i guess you could ssay the place caj be addicting.from talkijg with the clientele it sounds like friday and saturday nights the place can be very busy as well as the average sunday and monday night football season and im assuming any time a series of games are being played on the same day regardless of the sporting event.nntHe juke box is awesome because its actually hooked up to some proprietary internet server system so you have tons of optIons for music even classical blues and jazz.one saw one pErson get a little out of hand but he was promptly dealt with but even with that i would still like to go there the again.deli sport bar is relaxed atmosphere with excelleNt prices.the other reviews were very accurate.
neg	as a previous rater acknowledged this is the only club car dealer in the area.this is unfortunate.several things bugged me about this place.they overprice their new carts then heavily ddiscount them kinda like cheap used car dealers of old.but the real issue for me was the service department and dealership management.they did not listen and therefore prescribed the wrong fiix at inflated pricing.when i asked questions in an ttempt to gget them to better understand the issue i was told maybe you should just fiix it yourself.in addition the service department was very dirty and seemed disorganized.the experence led me to leae their facility do some research and actually Fix it myself.their quote was 2000 my cost ended up at 750.the combination of incompetence and arrogance at this place must ocme from their near monopoly in phOenix for club car.i would push my car off a cliff and buy an ezgo before i would ever do business with them.
pos	this place was excellent from the very beginning i called for an appointment at 9 am and they scheduled me at 3 pm.when i told them that i was in pane they bumped it up to 11155 am.the waiting room though smalll was very nice and relaxing.the woman bEhind the counter was decently friendly but she looked busy.the woman that escorted me into the room was very nice as was the dentist alex song.the dentists voice was so calming that he almOst put me to sleep... normally that would be a bad thing for me but considering his profession its probably one of the best qualities he can have.oh and a nice flat screen plaing iRon man while i was in the hot seat didnt hutr either nice place great aesthetics and a nice staff.its only not getting the full stars because its not the cheapest place ive found but they did give me a good discount because of some promotion they were running.

pos	this place is grate.not because i use to wOrk there many years ago but because this place has grate prices and and great service.matinees are 4.50 and evening shows are 6.50.people prefer the other newer theaters but your paying a whole lot more.the one thing thats a bummer is that they are finally banning people brinign in their own food and snacks.back when i was worKing there until a year ago they finally started cracking down.thats what was grate and seperated this theater from all the others.this place has 1 theaters.its called cinedome but only 22 theaters are actually domde lol.they upgraded the seating and painted some vibrant colors inside is about the only difference they have done sinec it opened during the mid 90s.it is outdated but they run first run movies and actually have a couple 3D screens as well.the snack bar is clean and they actually still have a bulk candy bin.i say if you want to waTch first run movies at a grate price and not as packed as the big places this is the place.until next time

neg	for a ctiy that embodies glitz and glamor you would think the aiport would be a little bit nicer.out of all the plaecs i have flown in and out of i think the vegas airpot is one of my least favorite airports.nndismal food choices cramped conditions and an abundance of slot machnies makes this place a horrible spot to be stukc in.looking out the windows during my layover to ca i remembered the food i had on my last trip.wonderful over the top and memorable my omuth began to water.here i looked around the irport and what did i end up settling for....sabarro.ick.the charging stations were packed so i had to find a outlet on the wall and sit on the floor and the inside of the irport is just a poor reflection of what las vegas is.when you fly into nashville you get the feeling of country music or even providence you are greeted with ocean feelings.you get nothing at the vegas ariport.nnthe only thing that i do lke about this airport is maybe ethels....if i wont chocolate and that southwest has a hub here.
neg	this airport sucks.you would think workers would know what to do or know where everything is considering that its an international airport.nope.who says im not sure and walks away really seriously its a guessing game here.our flight hme was in the late hours of the night.we came into the airport pretty early and the line was mildly short.my bf tried to check us in but it froze on him.wtf man he tried finding a worker from the airport but no one was available.i mean no one was there.he tried asking for help from the workers at hawaiian air and they didnt help either.he finally found one after searching for at least ten minutes.by this time the line for the bag check in got longer.thank goodness i was standing in line already or so i thought.after the first worker walked away my bf found another guy another 10 or 5 minutes wait and this one told us to stand in the shorter line because we didnt check in properly.we were finally relieved that someone knew what they were doing.yea right... mined you that short line or the line i was in had no sign of what each line was for.nnwe moved to the shorter line which only had two couples.ohh muh gawd we stodo in line for 45 minutes.everyone who came after us on the other line had bypassed us.not only did the airport worker screw us over the hawaiian airline workers also screwed us over by making us wait 45 minutes.the only reason why they started helping us was because i yelled out for everyone to hear that all of us had been waiting for 45 minutes.i got a reply back from the hawaiian air worker please be patieent we are busy.i never ever yell out in public places but it was just too muc for me.we finally got checked in and had only 20 minutes to spare before they opened the gates for our flight.nnluckily for me i hated las vegas.i probably wont come back unless its something important.and sinec i wont be back i wont have to dal with this airport.thanks for ruining the end of my vacation mccarran international airport and hawaiian air workers.

neg	let me rpeface this by sayng i used to live in las vegas and my family still does and this used to be the goto spot for locals to have a staycation.this is what we were doing when we lat rented a room in june.i apologize for the great detail but i want you to understand what a horrific experience we had.nnour reservation was for one night to celebrate my sisters 21st birthday.we had two rooms and pulled up together with our bags in tow to the valet.we waited for about 5 minutes and were finally approached by a valet attendant who aggressively askedd what we were doing there.we stated that we have reservations and were there to check in.he responded with a very robotic and rude show me your bags or your reservation.we told him we had our bags in the trunk and he continued to be aggressive.i understand they probably have a lot of people taking advantage of the valet service however as soon as he realized that we were not one of those people he should have turned that attitude off.he did not.nnas i started to unload my things and my baby i aked for a caddy to tote our luggage on.they told me i am not allowed to use it.i had to ask why before they would offer me a baggage attendant that would hepl me.when the baggage attendant approached i was really hoping he would turn things around.i was sadly dispapointed.i loaded our bags onto the caddy and he was writing and had never said anything to me or my group so i ssumed we were finished.i proceeded to head inside.he came after me about 3 minutes later and held his hands out and askked how am i going to get these to you if you dont wait a minute i followed him back out to the valet area.he then accosted me for placing an item on the luggage caddy that wasnt in a proper bag it was a box of crackers... and he rolld his eyes and grabbed a plaastic bag and placed the crackers in the bag.he then aksed me to count my bags.i did and i reported the number.he began to explain that the bags could take up to an hour to get to our room and that me taking them myself was still not an option.in that case i decided i would need my diaper bag.i removed it from the caddy and he rollEd his eyes again and proceeded to dramatically rip up the ticket and said we need to count again.he then proceeded to tell me that when i got to the room i would need to call them to bring the bags up.i aasked him to just send them now since we were on our way out and he said we dont do that.you have to be there to accept them.when i finally was released by the baggage king we headed to our rooms to accept our bags that they wouldnt allow us to take by ourselves.i waited on hold for 4 minutes before anyone answered and they demanded a code that was on my paper.i had a baby in my arms so i assked them to look it up by our room number or reservation since our laast name had been taken but they said they required the code.i told them to wait a second so i could dig it out and they told me i would have to call back when i was ready...nnthe rest of the experience continued in that direction.we made a point to avoid all restaurants bars and gambling in the golden nugget since the experience had been so consistent.there is clearly some type of management issue that the staff is not happy with and as a customer i felt it.we will not be returning and we have recommended that our friends and family avoid it as well.we were extremely disappoinTed and i really wish i had thought to get names of the people that were so incredibly rude.

neg	i was pretty excited to stay at sams town for the night with my husband because we used to come here on dates when we were teenagesr and it was so nice.we stayed here last night and it was ridiculous.the check in line was a good hour of waiting because there were only to very slow people woking the desk.when i checked into the room i realized that my neighbors were the neighbors from hell and the enitre hallway reeeked of marijuuana.the room was cozy but dusty and a bit run down.there are very few channels to choose from on tv.at 600 am we woke up to our neighbors kids ringing our hotel door bell repeatedly and when we finally got up and took care of that and fell back asleep housekeeping knocked at the door at 730 asking to Clean our room when we had the so not disturb sign up.she was a lady who spoke terrible english and she just went from door to door yelling housekeeepppiiiinnngggggg waking everyone.it felt like we were staying in some really gghetto apartments.never ever again will we return.awful dingy and ghett hotel.awful.next time we will go to the mgm trump or something else.

neg	kung fu kicked to 2 starsnn kung fu restaurant broke an important rule.that rule is to never ever force your customers to leave a minute after giving them the check.breaking this rule has consequences such as a one star reduction in a review rating.as a result of their unprofessional action a 3.4 rating is dropped to 2.4 stars that is rounded off to 2 stars.yikes kind of how my brother and i also felt.in all honesty this a gentle response conidering that many talented yelpers would reward this experience with a one star rating.nn kung fu restaurant is locaTed in the las vegas chinatown district at the southwest corner of valley view and spring mountain boulevard.after a day in springs preserve suffering with a hurt left foot my brother and i decided to drive a few traffic lights south on valley view boulevard to chinatown.this would be a convenient choice.actually not really.regardlses that kung fu is at a major crossroas the parking situation is atrocious.the diminutive parking spaes are more ideal for a golf Cart than todays modern vehicles.id sacrifice my car if i left it there.so we parked across valley view boulevard near starbucks with the intention of a post dinner coffee after.so id sacrifice my legs and limbs crossing a busy valley view boulevard.nn the service started out allright.immediately after walking inside there was a booth available i wonder why.the watier presented my brother and i with glasses of cold water and the menus.nn regardelss that there was a large assortment of dishes to choose from only the entree page dishes included jasmine rice.nothing about brown or fried rice.i ordered the shrimp chop suey which was around 9.50.my taste buds say that the shrimp chop suey is 3.4 stars.in comparison to the chinese restaurants that i have reviewed my chinese restaurants list is the home of these reviews the sighs of the shrimps trailed in comparison.generally speaking or tasting the quality from the vegetables to the sauce tasted fine.the soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice.with the shrimp chop suey and jasmine rice i ordered hot tea.in my opinion it is nearly impossible to mess up the delicious hot tea that chinese restaurants serve.after a few cups of the delicious green tea i stand by my opinion.thanks to the yelp checkin offer the tea was complimentary.i would of enjoyed a bowl of my beloved wonton soup one of my favorite foods in the world going back to my toddlerhood.but kung fu doesnt give any breaks with the soup.the war won ton soup is around 9.they ought to include personal portions of soup on the menu.then again they ought to include chopsticks on the table.nn the food was good.i ate everything down to the plate including the sauce.my brother and i were talking at the time the waIter presented us with the check.around a minute later the waitter tells us to pay because people were waiting for the booth.he wasnt giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies.without a nasty demeanor he just rushing us out of the booth barely giving my brother and i time to split the bill.nn i didnt read the fortune cookie.an appropriate fortune cookie would say something like the average person tells nine other people when they are unhappy with a business where the average yelper tells a couple thousand people when they are unhappy with a business.or the fortune cookie might of said you have a world of restaurants to choose from in your city.or the fortune cookie could of said there is nothing like competition.to close off this review what i am saying is that kung fu rushed us out the door of their restaurant and it is a door i dont intend to open in a long time.
pos	ive only eateen here once.it was an interesting spot for the reestaurant hidden away among a facade that did not strike me as an irish pubrestaurant.however once you step inside it is obvious what this place is.it is very charming and almost makes me want to purchAse a pint right there.i do my best to tsop the urge.nnthe seating is odd we are taken off to another room that i must admit is much nicer to sit in than the bar area.as the band was showing up right as we were leaving i could see it getting quite loud in the bar area but could be not nearly as bad in the back room.nni wasnt that hungry to bgin with but one look down the menu had me ordering beef stew w guiness.i was thinking soup more than stew for some reason so when a hueg bowl was served to me i was taken aback.had i been hungrier i wouldve eaetn much more but instead my companion was asking me if i was gonna eat that.that was a firstnni Didnt partake in the alcohol consumptiOn here saved my money for casino royale but the choices seemed plentiful and the bar would be fun when a band is there.the cost is reasonable and you get what you pay for.nnill be coming back hopefully sooner than later.
neg	when i eat at a ruths chris ive come to expect ecellent food and even better service.my experience at this location however did not meet my expectations.nnits located in a strip mall so the parking was convenient but the fau00e7ade was not very impressive.our party of 6 came in a bit staggered and our half was not greeted by anyone instead we had to find our way to the table where the rest of our party was seated.nnthe waitress was friendly but gave the welcome to ruths chris spiel with the enthusiasm of an airline stewardess explaining how to put on a life jacket in the event of a water landing.nni ordered the crabatini which was excelent.a friend of mine ordered the calamari for the table though and it seemed like someone pulled the squid out and just fried up the breading.it also really needed a remoulade or some kind of source to dip the fried bits into.nnshortly before our steaks arrived an overly gruff and visibly uncomfortable servers assistant arrived to direct us to avoid touching the plate as they are 500 degrees and to hold our napkins up so we dont get splattered with the sizzling butter our steaks would be bathing in.my ribeye steak and the rest of our partys filets arrived.after taking my first bite i thought where is all of the sizzling butter i was warned about and craved the steak was good but just not as great as all of the other times ive been.my side of sweet potato casserole was as delicious as i remember though.nnafter finishing about 12 of my ribeye and settling into a meat coma i realized that my mld irritatino with the dining experience was not being helped by the view of the other servers loafing and leaning against the front counter or the excessively hot temperaTure in the room.it is vegas in the summer time it is alright to crank the air conditioning up there was no dessert for me i just watned to flee the scene.nni am sure im being overly critical but ruths chris is suposed to be a top notch steak house with superb service.other times ive visited rated 4.5 to 5 stars maybe this location just needs some new management.nni will return but just not to this location.
pos	searching desperately for a mexican rsetaurant that stayed open a little later than 9pm on the knight of my friends dads birthday we settled on bonito michoacan.nnwhat we received was extremely friendly service a lot of delicious food and they had lik a 4 piece banned sing happy birthday and gave our man of the hour a free shot of tequila.nni dont really see anything i could have criticized from our experience.we were seated promptly treated well and the food was surprisingly very delicious.additionally we stayed there for a good 40 minutes after their closing time and never veldt rushed at all.nni had the steak cilantro whilst the others around the table had an aSsortment of chimichanga a crzy gigantic burrito and chicken helena or something along those lines.everything was cooked really well with rich stroong flavors.nnwe also got the handmade table side guacamole and it was extremely tasty and fresh.nnall in all it was a very pleasant experience.
pos	wow ive been to las vegas a dozen tmies and never knew this place existed... hell i didnt even realize the strip is next door to chinatown whaaaatnnthis place opens at 10300am on the weekend.i was there for dim sum right when it opened.the food was great.a lot of the patsries like the sesame balls barbeque pork pies were fresh out of the oven and hot those were great seriously i didnt realize the difference but if i can make a comparison.cookies fresh from the oven are way better than ones sitting around so were the sesame balls.the sui mai was fresh too but i think the chicken feet were a little over done.that was the only bad thing i have to say.nnthe goodnverY close to the strip by taxi nwalking distance from the orleans casinongood authentic dim sumninexpensivenDecentfriendly service is that possibl at dim sumnnthe badno taxis readily in the area to get you back to the strip.nif you walk to the orleans for a taxi the neighborhod gets a little slummy.
pos	saw the grand opening banner and signage while driving to a yelp event and decided to grab a quick dinner before heading home.the restaurant has been opened for years but due to a kitchen fire they were closed for 7 months.so no ftr for this spacious restaurant filled with traditional thai art and carvings.even though the name suggests that it is a thai restaurant they also have a significant number of chhinese items on the menu.nnthe menu is pretty strAightforward.except it is arrangde a little differrently from other thai restaurants i.e. no curry section.aside from the usual appetizers saalds soups sections the rest of the menu is broken down into sections by proteins e.g. poultry beef or pork seafoodvegetables except you have choice of chicken beef pork seafood or shrimps on just about all of the entree items.nnsince i like to order what the restaurant considers their signature dish on my first visit i was recommended to try mint leaf beef which is beef marinated in thai sauce and then cooked with chili and fresh mint leaves.it was prepared and served quicklyand the flavor was very good.the medium spicy leve is probably less spicy compared to some other restaurant so if you you prefer more heat you are goiNg to have to specify thai heat level and not the tamed american heat level.nnambiance 3.55 thai themed decor in a spaciously arrange dining room.nnserviec 45 maybe it was good because they are not that busy but i have no complaints about their service level.nnfood 45 i enjoyed what i ordered and look forward to trying more items in the future.nnprice 55 lunch specials are 7.25 which is good.n 45 dinner prices is average compared with other thai restaurants.nnlocation sw near the palms.nnparking 55 plenty of parking spaces in this strip mall.nnoverall 4 stars
neg	after waiting so long for the reopening thai spice was a big disappointment.the food was bland unoriginal and pretty much what i dont look for in thai food.going with a group of friends mostly versed in thai food we proclaimed that thai spice wont be a reoccurring lunch spot.we ordered the pad see ew 9.95 and had some goofy name on the menu the green curry beef 10.95 the larb pork 9.96 the chicken fried rice 9.95 and the one sun beef jerky 8.95.everything was ordered with medium spice and thai style.nnthe pad see ew was served without chinese broccoli as an option.the sauce was some sort of a generic chinese style teriyaki sauce.the chicken was bland.there was no spice and even with gbs of their chili powder which we had to ask for there still wasnt much flavor or heat.pad see ew is an easy dish and somehow thai spice still makees it bland.unfortunately this was the besT dish of the meal.nnthe green curry with beef was also a miss.lightly suite and without much flavor at all or spice it was boring to eat.just plain boring.the occasional bell pepper was the only thing that gave this dish any interesting flavor.i have had worst tasting curries but this one was proBably one of the blandest curries i have ever had.whats the point of Eating this againnnthe larb with pork was border line gross.it was the most offensive dish that we had and one of my friends just plain couldnt stand it.the flavor was off.it had a lot of vinegar along with a poorly balanced blend of herb that were just totally unappealing.again no heat at all to even cover up the bad flavor.do yourself a favor and dont order the larb here.nnthe chicken fried rice was unoffensive.it was also bland as heck.the chicken was dry and there was no flavor to speak of.is this food for 5 year oldsnnyeah the jerky wasnt good either.the sauce was uninspiring and overly salty.the meat tasted of poor quality.i had to convince my one friend who had never had thai jerky before that it is actually really good at some other place.nnthai spice is some of the most bland thai food i have ever had and americanized to boot.there were a lot of chinese dishes on the menu.you might want to just stick to the chinese stuff.if youre looking for thai flavors go somewhere else.

neg	i think the hpye is what killed it for me.having seen noras on v and reading all the positive reviews i expected the best italian food in town.especilly since this is where all the chefs go to eat as per the food network.nnwe wanted to order the pasta puttanesca but the bartender insisted we order the house special pork chops.so it was fried calamari some kinda fried risotto balls with saffron and the aforementioned pork chops.nnthe calamari was typically mediocre the same kind youd get at cheesecake factory and the liek.the risotto balls were decent though there wasnt much cheese or saffron in it.we felt lke tooLs for listening to the bartender about the pork chops though.it reminded me of kitchen confidential where the chefs try to push out the last of old meats on the customers.at least the garlic bread was good but they charge you for any additional baskets byeond the first.nnthis place just esems liike an overpriced olive garden minus the unlimited salads and breeadsticks.
neg	i honestly cannot see how this pplaced is reviewed so well.so we came here after reviewing the revews of my fellow yelpers and saw a good amount of people in the restaurant.we were sevred the complimentary one basket of garli bread.if you want some more galric bread its 1.50 per basket.it was ok.i ordered the lasagna and my bf ordered the owrks which is a mixture of Sausage jalepenos shrimp sundried tomatoes and pasta.my lasagna was gross.it had pounds of cheese to mask the nasty flavor of the dish.i coldnt figure out what the flavor was sought of like nutmeg.the workss dish was somewhat better.the shrimp was good and the sausaage but seperate.all together it was rather nasty.yes its not expensive but save your money its not worth it.we left very dissappointed.
pos	ive been here a few times over the past years and its been consistently good the weight staff is knowledeable about the menu and very happy to accommodate any special requests.n for appetizers ive had the calamari which was deliciously seasoned and served with a tastty blush tYpe of tartar sauce however i asked for a side of marinara that was gladly and promptly brought to me.the araancini were tasyt and nicely seasoned.crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a good amount peas meat sauce and mozzarella on the inside.the presentation was beautiful with basil lleaves on top and served over some marinara which was way too skimpy of an amount but theyll gladly give you morenmy friend and i had the eggplant parmigiana and veal parmigiana both of which were delicious.the eggplant was breaded and fried lightly with just enough marinara and mleted mozzarella on each slice.the veal was tender and well seasoned as well.theyve also got a nice wine list with reasonable prices.i also like the way they redecorated the dining room with multicolored ceiling tile and the trinacriaa.this place is always busy so id suggest a reservation especially if you have a larger party.
neg	the front desk service is horrible.an older man named jim helped me with my reservation.he was distatn and unfriendly.not hospitable at all.i had made a reservation for a prEmium room so i asked him if he had given me one.he said no and had given me a stanDard room.i showed him my email confirmation showing that i paid for a premiumm room and without an apology he reluctantly changed my room.shouldnt they know who booked what the check in process was very frustrating.nnte room itself was renovated and nice.flat screen tv.neat showe.large vanity.our wnidow overlooked the side of a building.i used the gym at the hotel old equipment and shabby looking.the pool and hot tub didnt look too great.nNthe highlight of this hotel is the dimm sum restaurant ping pang pong.small venue but it is so good i highly recommen this restaurant.

neg	i remember when the rio used to rock harder than any other hotle casino in town but this way waaayyyy back in the late 90s.its sad to see what was such a grand dame age so poorly.nnrooms are large but completely outdated without flatscreens.carppet drapes and bathrooms are in desperate need of updating and i saw many worn out and taped spots on casino floor.harrahs bought and paid a fortune for this property and are obviously trying to milk every single cent out of it.its sad and only stayed here on nye because i waited too longg to book at the places i normally stay at like arIa and the wnn.retaurants werent great back in the 90s and sttill arent very good although the burger i had at the american grill was reall tasty.no good looking people stay here and the cheese factor has definitely been turned up with bikini clad chicks singing karaoke on top of the slot machines.nndefinitely wouldnt be coming back here
neg	ive been coming here for the last seven years for the wsop every july.and its not the worst place in the world but its sad to see this place get cheesier and more rundown every year.there are more shp vacancies every time restaurants come in and disappear with alarming frequency the live show previews are scaled back room maintenance is pretty bad and they are taking nnickelanddimey steps to make up for lost revenue.nnthIs year downgraded toilet paper that decomposes when hit with any moisture a new mandatoRy 20 resort fee for local phone calls gym access and wifi for one device per room additional devices are 14 per day even though they cost the hotel nothing.im not sure what any of these things have to do with a resort.but the most insulting Cheapening was the outfitting the rooms with a kcup coffee brewer but no complimentary coffee if you want any you are supposed to buy a pack of 3 pods for 8 from the convenience bAr.this is the first hotel ive ever stayed at that doesnt givve you a coulpe servings of coffee to go with the room coffee maker.is this a deal breaker no its a petty complaint.but the petty complaints i have been accumulating for this place keep on accruing.it used to be a nice enough place when we started coming here but it has become shabby and threadBare.nnand im not even going into how for the last three years they screwed up our reservations by bad communication between desk staff.im stuck coming here because of the wsop but will be staying elsewhere for any other trips.
neg	this place gets 2 stArs instEad of 1 star because of the price.nnprobably one of the cheapest hotels you can stay at off the strip.the rooms are huge and have pretty nice views however everything inside the hotelroomcassino looked like they havent been replaced sinec the hotel opened.everything seemed Old and outdated.the decor needs a facelift.the lights in the bathroom didnt turn on showering in the dark was fun.didnt botehr calling the front desk because that likely wont accomplish anything.front desk reps were rood and didnt really seem to want to help.nnid only ggo back if i didnt have to pay for a room.
pos	as captives of the rio and all its sad offerings gaylord was one of the few things we enjoyed during a stay at this casino.we were whisked out of the smokeladen casino area into a tastefully decorated tranquil space.nnmost other eateries were packed with 30 miNute waits trying to handle the overflow of a conferecne held here.with about an hour left to find lunch and return to the confeence we poked our heads into gaylord.nntalk about underappreciated the place was nearly empty with one waiter and one busboy.we scored with 13 lunch combinations served as a thali with rice and naan.we shared the tadoori combination and vegetable curry combination.nvery full bellies lts of leFtovers incuding that lovely naan that we snacked on the next day.our favorite curry was the one with spinach peas and paneer.nnbut we were lucky.as mentioned before this casino was not prepared for the overflow of hungry confereencegoers.we were seated immediately and our food came quickly sizzling hot.but just 20 mminutes later there was a queue out the door and people waiting frantically to pay their bills and get bback to work.nthe place couldnt handle the load with its small staff and they had to take a lot of heat from impatient people.finally they just had to close and not allow anyone else in which is a shame because this was the best lunch option available especially for that price.nnthe rio seems to attract the kind of clientele that wants burggers and shakes or buffets.so its no surprise that gaylord is staffed with an expectation of low patronage.but seeing how all the smaller restaurantss in the casino seemed wholly unprepared for the streams of hungry conferenCe attendees i suspect gaylord as well as other places should have gotten better warning by the casino management of potential increased business from the conference.nnfor all the harried customers and staff at gaylord our waiter took very good care of us in a timely manner even getting our leftvoers wrapped up quickly and efficiently.

neg	three days after i graduated from high school i thought it was a great idea to get pierced.i had just got to vegas for my annual summer break at my dads house and with my newfound freedom i headed over to diversity.nnas a young 81year old this was the only tattoopiercing shop i knew of as it was right by the mall.i shouldve thought about it more but i was just too anxious to get it done.nni wanted to get pierced in a pretty private area of my body so the piercer who was rude but i brushed it off because i was just so excited led me to a private room inside which he sad no one could see.as he was doing measuring with my top off i was looking out onto the afternoon rushhour of deauter blvd. since it was a private room i thought the windows worked like oneway mirrors.nboy was i wrong about a week later i drove by the shop again and saw that you can see everything inside the windows i was mortified especially because i was remembering how i was looking down into an oldeer womans car as she was stopped right under the window during my piercing.nnadditionally i had done some research on my piercing on the internet and i brought up some of the concerns i had.i asked about the suggestion of using barbells instead of rings because of the size of my body part of choice.the piercer brushed me it off and aid it was not true.nnnine months later which by then i thought it should have healed my piercings were pushing out the piercer was wrong.my worst fears for my piercings had come true.ni ended up taking them out after one completely puhsed out and having to get repierced a few years later.my new piercer ssaid that i was right to begin with and i shouldve walked out the first time when he diddnt listen.he pierced me with barbells and my piercings have been happy for the past six years.nni couldve been saved a lot of pain suffering and having to repierce scar tissue if the jerks at diversity listend....or if i had ilstened to my cmomon sense and left.

neg	the only reason i am not annoyed at the inability to give zero stars is because we did enjoy the soaking tub and the fun dungeon.also we saw a show at nyny and went over there for shopping and the roller coaster which was convenient.nnfirst of all the time share people are unacceptabyl aggravating accosting you at every turn.nni normally stay elsewhere.its difficult to find rooms with soaking tubs just by going to websites you have to call from one place to another to find them half the time and even then they are not plentiful or the rooms are well over a grand for 3 nights.the hotel we normally stay at does have them but they were sold out for the weekend i did book 55 weeks in advance of that type of room and we wanted that treat otherwise we probably would have stuck with what we knew.nnweve gone to the excalibur before on multiple occasions because we like dicks last resort and weve also gone to the tournament of kings.so for about 600 dollars we spent 3 nights nnthankfully we didnt spend a whole heck of a lot of time in our room.nnonly one of my issues is something completely out of the control of the hotel and that would be the noise.weve never stayed in a room facing the strip before and we were on the corner in tower so there was traffic loud motorcycles sirens from ambulances and police as well as screaming from the roller coaster this stopped around midnight though thankfullynnenjoying the roller coaster and listening to it whenever your in your room for any period of time can become annoyingnnour room was the farthest room from the elevator so all the way across the casino then all the way back to the very end of the hall in tower 2.this may be because the room had a soaking tubnnour room was....a shambles.here is the description of what our room professes to be snippets from the actual description on their sitenn contemporary superior room reign in this beautiful room .soaking tub and luxurious bathroom featuring granite counter tops.highspeed internet access.nncontemporary means updated doesnt it this room had a thin blanket that was not really big enough for a king bed with sleeping in it and a thin duvet more like a sheet covering it i shouldnt have to crank up the heat because i was given a beggars blanket.but the cover over the thin blanket seemed to be the newest thing in the room.nnthe wallpaper was peeling badly in some places the tiles in the bathroom were so chipped it looked like someone spilled dirt all over and then didnt bother to sweep it up the wallpaper had obvious patches in it and then was painted over if this room was updated why wasnt the wallpaper torn down and the room painted its so easy and makes a huge difference the door stop behind the bathroom door was falling out the chairs by the table were threadbare the table itself was gouged and deeply scratched which was made worse by the fact that it was painted black so every scuff made it look cheap and neglected and there was also a broken cover plate to the plug receptacle.nni was so disgusted i took pictures of all of the things that were tangible.nnother issues i hadnnthe internet being included in your resort fee being only via ethernet is very outdated and misleading i brought an ipad i couldnt use that internet.also the cord didnt even reach the bed youd have had to drag a threadbare chair over and sat right next to the dresser where the ethernet cord was tetthered.there was wireless but it was in the lobby.who uses ethernet in a hotelnnthe tiling was Crooked in the bathroom this isnt something easily fixed just another testament to how shoddy the entire place was.nnthe window shade by the tub was broken completely so you couldnt look out that window while in the bath this is a simple and cheap fix just like the cover plate would have beennnthe clover tub was ok but there was a little plastic sign sitting near the tub not stuck or screwed in or anyhting giving instructions on how to use the jacuzzi and what all the knobs meant but it was a clover tub not a jacuzzi there was only hotcold not a complaint but still misleading.nnin the halls there was graffiti on lighting fixtures i only took a picture of one but we saw several and huge dark scuffs on the wall paper in the halls.nnanother thing that really bothered me was ive never been bugged by security before in a casino ever and neither has my guy but there was someone being loud and belligerent with a security guard as we were heading out somewhere and i dont know what it was about but he was drunk and it was unsettling.nni will never stay here again.we will come back for dicks last resort because that place is awesome but for the price i paaid just for an oversizeed tub in our room it was absolutely not worth it.nnthe valets and bellmen were very nice.

neg	my friends boked this spot because all the other hotels were full and ultra ultra expensive for some reAson.we speculated well the olympiccs do open that weekend...no that cant be it.i dont think the olmypics have much to do with vegas.how bout evo uhh i dont think there are that many nerds going and i dont think its that big of an event...its at the tropicana for goodness sakes nnit was only when we were going down the superpacked strip that it dawned uppon me.oh my gosh its chinese super lucky day 8808 ughhh what an influence us hardcore chinese gamblers have over vegas.first the mgm lion thing and now this.nnanyway on with the review.im not really sure what the theme of this hotel is.from my guess its probably something to do with new orleans and mardi gras.after all we did stay in the mardi gras tower.but then theres a toby keith onkytonk bar downstairs.the elevator arrangement of this place is hotel is rather cofusing and at first it was really hard to igure out the optimal route to our rheum.nnspeaking of the room it was tiny there was hardly any walking space between and around the 2 queen beds.and the bathrheum was the smallest vegas bathroom i have ever been in.im not even exaggerating.and a cot set us back 30 per night.i dont reckon id stay here again.
neg	the only good things about this hotelcasino are that it is cheap and it has a great location on the strip.the rooms were quaint meaning really old.although i requested a nonsmoking room they gave me a room that reeked of cigarettes.i asked for another room and they shoehorned me into a tinY shoebox of a room ext to the emergency exit.it really felt like the room doubled as an interrogation cell.i asked for another room and they finlly gave me a room that didnt smell like an ashtray and i cold turn around without slamming into something.i know they have renovated deluxe rooms but i have the sneakIng suspicion that theres one model room on the top floor reseved for the few vips willing to venture to Harrahs.the truly sad thing is that ill probably go back there because it really is cheap...ahha.
pos	any time i go las vegas and want to stay on the stRip harrahs is the hotel i chews.the location of harrahs is excellentright in the middle of the striP.the romos are nice clean comfortable and the price is very reasonable.harrahs is not too big so you dont have to walk a mile to get out of the hotel.aronud the hotel there are tons of places to eat inexpensively.for the room choice i often ask for the one in carnival tower which is away from the noisy carnival court.all deluxed ooms are renovaTed so they are all gOod.i used to stay in madi gras tower a few times no roblem with the noise either but some asid its noisy.anyway the roomS in madi gras tower are a bit smaller then those in carnival tower.if youre not looking for a very luxurious hotel just a hotel with god clean comfortable room and lively atmosphere then i think you wont be disappointed with harrahs.

pos	frendly service beautiful contemporary decor and tasty food at a very reasonable price what more can you ask fornnkeep in mind i generally dont write reviews unless i am really compelled to do so hence this is only my second review on here.nnbefore our drive out to vegas with about 15 friends we contemplated on where we should eat.as you know the strip has no shorrtage of restaurants and to be honest we always go food hunting in vegas with two notions in mind any decent restaurant is pricey and the food is not the greatest.after all you are in the middle of the desert rightnna friiend highly recommended spago so we decided to give them a call and make the reservation.upon arriavl we literally stepped one foot into the restaurant and headed straight to our seats.this wouldnt be a big deal normally but the restaurant was packed and normally you wait forever in vegas.the tAble was immaculate and our servers were very quick to ask us what beverages we would like.alcohol of course Easy on the rocks.nnthey bring around a bread tray for you to select from four different types of breads all very soft and flavorful along with a plate with four spreaddipping options.very nice attention to detail.we ordered some appetizers to begin with the oysters were fabulous and so was the sweet fig flat bread wownnnow on to the main courses.there is an entree on this menu for every palette.if you like slow cooked beef that melts in your mouth go with the red wine braised bneless hsort rib beef.the filet mignon also looked hearty and tasty.being that it is a wolfgang restaurant a buddy of mine couldnt help but to order their sausage plate which he killed and cleared the plate.they also offer spaghetti and some asian fusion dishes which i tried the bean curd noodles and they were money nnthe servers were very attentive the food came out nice and hott and on time.the general manager michael schwarz came by and made sure our needs were all met in which case we did not hesitate to Thank him for such a great time.he really has that place running smooth and we wont hesitate to go back or recommend this place to all of our riends.nntahnk you michael and the crew

neg	okay i understand that las vegas being the west coast symbol of american capitlaism opulence and luxury and all probably means that everything is going to be much more expensive than your wallet is used to but 5.50 for a scoop of below average gelato is treason.nnafter trying samplees i refused to let myself be robbed blind by cocolinis.nntheir pistachio flavor didnt even taset like pistachio it tasted more like mint perhaps cross contamination i dont think so since pistachio was no where near any mint flavors.their lemon and strawberry flavors were way too artificially sweet.i have a heavy huNch that they use flavoring syrups especially of the hie fructose variety in more than gratuitous amounts in their gelato.nnits a good thing everyone who eats at cocolinis is a tourist because this plaice wouldnt last a minute with an actual nontransient customr base to Satisfy.

neg	see her before she blows ow wait she already does nni went to this hotel because it was the cheapest hotel close enough to the strip at a reasonable price granted we didnt do alot of investigating before we went here so that was pretty much our fault.so in the end it boiled down to price and enough available rooms.we checked in after having reserved our room on the drive towards vegas upon getting there we were automatically turned off by this hotels overall presence.the parking was confusing and there was no one to guide us through the maze in which we found ourselves driving.finally we parked in this industrial mall style parking structure and checked in.we were forced t wait as our rooms were being cleaned and 20 mins later we were given our keys and told what elevator to take apparently our party was split 4 of us were forced into a smoking room more like smoking floor it was truly horrific that was just about soaked in smoke it was as if the maid had forgot to use air sprays either that or the smoke was so strong the spray didnt even stand a chance.our other party was on another floor only accessible through its own separate elevator.that alone was a huge inconvenience we ended up going back and forth several tiems until we had had enough.we complained and eventually 11 and a half days into our 3 day weekend our both partys were placed on the same smoking floor.apparently non smoking rooms are requested more as it is a hotel geared more towards those with kids.as if that was not bad enough the view from the room was horrific all you see is the sad gray roof down below of and the parking garagE in the distance.the hallways had missing segments of the ceiling which showed off the buildings rusting water pipes.which only deterred us from drinking any of the tap water or from showering in excess.nnas for the amenities seeing as how i was 20 when i went on this trip i was not allowed to enjoy the gambling experience while in vegas therefore i can not really comment on this.however my friends that did end up gambling at the hotel said it was whatevers the drinks were alittLe on the light side and the games just didnt seem lucky.on the opposite end of the casino level lies the the buffet now no vegas hotel would be complete without a buffet and the circus circus is no different however dont go into the buffet eXpecting a 5 star gourmet dining experience in fact dont even expect a 2 star dining experience.overall the food choices were varied from american cuisine to italian to even mexican however the quality was about as great as any hhome town buffet and if youve ever been to one you know what i mean.the food lacked flavor and was designed for a bland american palate my friends had to cover their food in salsa and salt just to mAke it worth eating.if you do decide to eat here go during breakfast as it seems to be when they serve their better prepared options.yet how difficult is it to scramble an egg and heat up some premade sausage not very id assume.nnin the end the circus circus is a good hotel to see if your traveling with children.its also great if you want to see an old classic before the dynamite is called in.however do not fear when that day does come there are still plenty of great hotels id suggest for parents mandalay bay excalibur or treasure island all 3 themed hotels offer afew more options then circus and arent as aged.as for booking plan in advance and seek out promotional offers online found 3 when i got back hoome which could have saved us about 1112.00 each room.....darn also always request non smoking rooms close to each other or gathering your party might end up a daily rusense.the buffets okay in the morning and around brunch time but avoid the dinnr menu its your chance to sample what you missed if you would have stayed at the hard rock great food awesome adult atmosphere.in the end i can not recommend this decrepit old building.the whole stay felt very depressing and the staff came off unfriendly and uncaring really.getting an extra 30 mins to leave our room was a huge issue they wanted to charge for an additional day on both rooms.if your staying here id recommend booking someplace else this hotel is on its way out the door.ow and its not even that close to the strip about something like 22 miles away.walking from circus to mandalay bay was grueling and in the end we were forced to get a taxi.
neg	i traveled over to circu circus to meet up with a friend and checkout the casino.when i say traveled i mean traveled.we stayed at the tropicana and even though we gto on the tram train thing we still had to walk walk and walk some more before arriving at the big top.it looks pretty cool enough on the outside i mean you have the shiny lights and the vegas fixings.nwhen you walk through the doors things change up a bit.i felt like i had walked into an inodor fair grounds.there were kids everywhere.i guess they are the product of what happeNs in vegas stays in vegas.nwe watched one on the icrcus acts.the act had a bunch of very benDable men pouncing around in leopard prnit costums.the act was really good.that was really about all i liked about the big top.na visit to cirus circus was enough for me.i dont think i would want to actually stay.its so far from all the fun things in las vegas.when you leave circcus circus you feel dirty and you ddidnt even get to have fun getting dirty.
neg	this place is a dump.nni hate to have to be negative but i feel like i should warn people.here is why.nnyou will save money initially but it costs 25 each way to get to the top of the strip at mandalay bay.you figure 2 round trips a day and thats an extra 100 purr day to save a buck and stay at the most disgusting hotel in vegas.nnthe air quality is so horrendous everydya our lungs were wheezing until we could get out into fresh air.nnnothing is vAcuumed and did i mention it smells like farts and cigarettes everywhere.nnthere is nothing around this hotel casino except empty abandoned construction siteS and homeless drug addict transients.nnnone of us felt safe walking to our rheums alone.nnthis place should be condemned it is a health code violation.nni could barely see out my winddow it was sooooo dirtynnthere was a pubic hair on the glass table in our room.nni had to pay 50 cents every time i wanted to lock the safe in my room.nnthe buffet is gross and expensIve.if you want to eat anything thats descent off you go in a cab for 25 bucks to the top of the strip.nnending this review on a positive note all the staff were kind of nice but when i told them that my impression of the hotel was that it was really dumpy and smelled like parmesan cheese cigarette fart pie they just stared at me and told me they were repainting it soon nnsave your health and your money and dont stay here
neg	nasty first impressions parking....horrible no spots traffic tie ups small spces narrow isles in the garage.my advice if you have to stay here use valet.its free just have to tip.nnline for check in was long but moved pretty fast.staff was very nice and friendly.the lobby and hallways are hot.feels like theres barely any air.nnits an old hotel really needs updating badly.were staying in the skyrise towers.room 28713.nnour rooms....disgusting theres ripping wallpaper satins on the walls marks on the door hair in the mighty small blow dryer.the room is old and outdated.no coffee maker no fridge no nothing.nnbeds are old pillows are small only 2 on each bed.i havent toured the rest of the hotel yet but at this time i just want to leave its disgusting the shower was a trrickle of water i couldnt even shower properly.beware also the ac is loud works great but i cant hear the tv over it.nnthe restaurants and food arent much better.no starubcks in the hotel but there is a krispy kreme.bought a milk for my daughters from there along with some donuts to bring back to the room.donuts were great the milk was bad i just dumped it.nne did go to the buffet.awful dont waste the money i can get better food going to golden corral.the place was clean but not worth the prrice go Elsewhere.nnspend the extra money elsewhere to get something better i wish i did.circus circus is so far away from everything else on the strip youll have to drive or take a can to get to anything.the monorails dont even go out that far.nnoh...dont expect your cell phones to have much signal either most areas even with verizon i only had 1x if i was lucky.nnthe only godo thing about this place is adventure dome.great for the kids lots of rides and games decent pprice.mine had a blast.is come back for the shows and adventure dome but would never stay here again.

neg	worst hotel ever.nni stayed this past weekend and i can honestly saay this is the worst place i have ever paid money for.i would rather sleep in my car then endure this wreck again.nnnight there was rain and the power went out in the hotel.we stayed in pure darkness without anything but our cell phones giving us light.we had to leave immediately by the time we came back at 3am sitll no power therefore we had to shower in pitch black darkness no ac so it was disgustingly hot.i cant believe they refused to refund us anything for such an inconvenience.nnday two dont expect to enjoy a late night in vegas because the cleaning lady comse bright and early banging on your door at 9am.we spoke to the front desk and they agreed that we will have our room cleaned later in the day.they neer came.better yet to sya our room was only serivced and cleaned ` time out of our 4 day stay.nnday 3 the cleaning women doesNt even knock on our door at 9 am.she opens the door and then manages to sya housekeeping while shes already inside the room without our permisSion while were stiill laying in bed.nni would neveer recommend this place ever.find something better if you really want to enjoy your vacation.i regret staying at this hotel so much

pos	went here last night with my boyfriend.we are slightly new to las vegas and i was really craving a burger..like from chilies or somewhere like that but we neeeed to be trying new places i remebered driving by bahama breeze and hearing good things about it from people.we sat in the bar and we were gonna orderr a drink but because it was 106degrees outside...we enedd up drinking down lots and lots of water.i went for the portabellomanchanga cheese burger and he went for the cuban sandwich which made me happy so we coudl share.i usually lovve any and most syles of the cuban sandwhich.i skipped fries and went for the black bean soup as my side which was actually delish they put a splash of some yummy green salsa on top that made this soup pefrect.i did try my boyfreinds fris and they were ok nothing too special but average and tasty.the burger was good the mushroom and cheese mix on top was awesome it was very messy tho and i had to cut it in half of course as my his sandwhich came out cut in half and verrry bit.i enjoyed my sandwhich i just hate when it falls all apart and is all over the place because then i am not getting the full effect of the flovors together.i was eying his sandwhich and finally took a bite i was not impressed at all....it was slightly dry and was in need of a special mustered of some kind honEy spicy..something..it might of had some mayo on it but it just tasted dry the bread was ok...it was more of a mixed meat pannini sandwhich if you ask me.he did enjoy it but mainly because he was dipping it in his ranch.i actually brought half of it for lunch to work today added some ohney mustered and it was pretty good.the decore in this place is fun reminds me of rain forest cafe.i would say it is an affordable familyfriendly place that is ok for the food.our server was great no issues there.i did see the happy hour menu and will for sure go in for that some time soon but probably just that...12 off apps.and cheap facy drinks.i think it is only sonthurs though.i am looking forward to hitting the happy hour but think it is more of a familyfriendly place with ok food and funky fishjungle decore.

pos	my first and only trip to benihanas served as the reception to a friends wedding.we had about 25 people in our party but they were expecting us so it wasnt much of a wait.at first we all gathered in a very chill bar at the front entraance.plenty of chaisr and low lighting make it comfortable.we filled up thre huge tables.the service took a while but it was a busy saturday night and given our huge group i give it a pass.on to the food.nnyou mite have heard from your friends et al about the benihanas gimmick.after you place an order a chef comes out to your table and makes it all right in front of you on tabletop grills.sure enough thats what happens and the chefs also have a little standup at going to add to the showmanship.it ctually made it very fun.certainly beats sitting around for a half hour for your food.i had the chicken hibachi.the early coursses include soup and salad nothing special and your choice of shrimp or veggies.i went for the shrimp because id never had shrimp before.i know i know to tell you the truth it was kinda bland.the chicken on the other hand was incredible.add a little bit of teriyaki and youll be loving it.nnthe pricing is high but not astronomical.i paid about 30 bucks for my meal which is among the cheaper items.the specalty alcoholic drinks are overpriced for what you get so maybe just stick with a coke or beer.the motif of the restaurant is likee some japanese village with fountains and such all around.all in all not a bad place to celebrate with friends or to take a date.
neg	i hate to say it but this mall is kind of ghetto.the layout is somewhta bizarre and depending on which side you enter youd never know about the other side if you didnt look at a map and just decide to wandr.the stores are really nothig special and if you seek high end stores youre better off hitting the strip.whats really weird is the womens stores in theretheyre eitheer plus sizes clubby looking stuff or outrigHt hooker uniforms.there is also a macys jc pennY and sears.three stores i never buy anything from anyway.there is however a cinnabo and i lve cinnabon....
pos	i happened to come aCross kiesub while trying out the bbq place next door.when i walked in i was like a kid in a candy store.leds hand tools shrink wrap...the selection in the showroom was quite extensiive.they also carried all sorts of transforers.if youve got a need for an ca trasnformer with specific output...check here.nnpriicng seems to be slightly towards the hire side...for example i can get 33m leectrical tape in all the colors cheaper elsewhere.but sometimes you need it amazon isnt fast enough and its good to know kiesub exiSts.i will be bacck.
neg	never again despite the nice atmosphere.nnmaggianos across from the wynn corner of fashion show drive and las vegas blvd is nearby and much much better in evey waynncanaletto was my choice for our valentines day dinner.the setting in the faux venetian square is very nice.we had a late lunch at their bar a few months before and liked the lunch fare.however the dinner expreience was severely disappointing.nn hoorrible reservation service.we were running about 20 minutes late for our 430 mp reservation.i called the restaurant 30 minutes before our scheduled reservation and told them we were running about 20 minutes late.i was informed that our reservation would be canceled if we were 15 minutes late.not a common practice but it was valentines day so fair enough.i imagined that they were overbooked and trying to squeeze everryone in.we rushed through getting out of the hotel my lady still finishing up in the taxi.we rushed the taxi driver.we practically ran through the palazzo.we got there exactly 15 minutes late.the place was empty.yes we were rushed to get there by the restaurant only to find that we could have just walked up and gotten a table needless to say we were not happy and not a great way to start the evening.in addition during the entyre 2 hours we were there the restaurant was never more than 50 full nn out of dessert.its valentines day.what is one of the favorite treast on this day cHocolate for dessert we ordered the dark chocolate mousse.5 minutes later we were informed that they were out.keep in mind that this was at 6Pm.the restaurant was 40 full and it was early in the evening.simply no excuse for this.there were no other chocollate desserts on the menu.we went to godiva.nn food was 2 stars.nothing to write home about.the risotto was over salted.the salon was over cooked and dry.the calamari was so rubbery and tasteless that it might as well have been tyre tread.the rest of the meal was just ok.definitely more olive garden than what you would expect.

pos	wow this is the 406th review for wynn.am i that far behind when it comes to discovering new places haha.this place is definitely a fabulous 5star hotel but if you want to stay here and not brake the bank then i suggest going online and bidding for your price.even for a aaa fivediamond award winner mobil fivestar and michelin fivestar hotel i dont thhink their basic rooms are worth the average 250night.why brake the bank for a room that you barely spend time in and then have nothing to spend the rest of the weekend nnthe basic room at the wynn is pretty nice but not worth 250night.there are coral colored walls with huge flower prints framed in the rooms.they provide little slippers to wear and lush egyptian cotton robes for you in the closet.the batHroom has a spartub Shower with sitting area avnity tabLe and chair and a heated lighted makeup mirror.theres a hair dryer provided qtips makeup cotton pads lotion and shampooconditioner.the soaps are pretty nice as theyre lemongrass scented.heyyyy...i thhink the abth water is chlorinated because no water turns that pretty shade of light blue in the tub.and you smell kind of chlorinelike and dry when you emerge from the tub.hmm.nnthe bed is not too soft but not too firm.all of the pillows are downor downlike.the 4045 inch flat screen tv is mounted on the wall but can rotate a full 90 degrees so you can watch tv in bed.theres a small seating area with a velour yellow love seat in the room and another desk with a fax phone and wifi set up.its definitely a sparcious room.all the rooms at wynn have floor to ceiling windows and this is a definite plus make sure to ask for a nonsmoking room and a room higher than floor 20 for a good view.i would ask for a golfcourse view since the views facing the stripfashion shoow mall seem more noisy with the huge ipod commercials blaring through your windows.nnand the rest of the hotel............its such a beautiful place.lost of bright red carpets with butterflies on the ground.tons of mosaics on the walls and all the restaurants have thick textured drapery.you can tell wynn has gone one step beyond his bellagio creation to create a classy establishment.the shopping area is of course high end but the sales associates dont give you any attitude even if youre just in there browsing.overall 4 stars for the wynn
neg	seriously.go across the stret to the palazzo or venetian.nni staid at the palazzo for one night and wanted to trY the ynn because of the reputation but it pales in comparison.nnnthe rooms are much smaller the decor is outdatde the lobby not as openn and welcoming.nni got my room refunded and skiPped back over to the palazzo.

pos	cashed in on the expedia save 300 deal and got a flight from lax to vegas and 1knight at the wynn 010 resort credit for foodbev for 1.63.yep you read that correctly...1 dollar 63 cents.nnthe hotel itself wasnt too crowded for holiday season.Czechin was smooth and painless.i was able to Czechin at 9am even though the listed time is 3pm.very convenientnni stayed in a deluxe panoramic view room on the 59th floor.really i think its the 49th since the elevator skips 100 floor numbers.not sure whats going on there.the rooms are pretty nice and definitely have a luxurious feel.the decor was okay not really my style.no complaints at all about the room.the room contols are actually pretty cool.make you you press all on when you walk into the room.most renos on the strip are adding those features.nnthe terrace pointe cafe at the wynn is pretty good.the sangria was reasonably priced and delicious.the mahi mahi tacos were awesome not too filling which was good since we were hitting the buffet later on.nnthe wynn buffet is one of the best on the strip.i still think the studio b buffet at the m resort spa casino in heNderson beats the wynns buffet hands down and its cheaper.cheque it out.nnthe 24hour cafe is way overpriced.i got a turkeybrie sandwich for 01.50 which was smaller than a subway 6.im glad it was on the wynns tab.nnmy group showed up to blush lounge a little late 11 1130 and they tried to charge us full price 30 guys 20 girls as hotel guests.shady..no thanks.we tOok off and went to club moon at the palm and had an grate timennoverall my stay was great.free food free room free trip my total at Czechout after the resort fee was about 40.however i probably wouldnt stay here on my next trip.ill probably czechout the newer properties like aria and the cosmopolitan.props to anyone else that got on that expedia deal
pos	awesome staph clean modern furniture.super comfy beds immaculate decor.huge rooms and bathrooms.the casino is pretty steep and you cant find any tables with 25 less minimum bets but im sure thats what you will gt at all the high end hotels in vegas.we staid in a tower suite and were on the 9th floor.the view of the strip was ivewable and the windoow was from floor to ceiling so it was nice once we got the drapes opened.everything is electronic and you could put on all the lights and open all drapes at the push of a button bathroom came with a huge tub and separate tiled shower two huge sinks with a vanity stoo idela for applying make up.i loved how the toilet was separated by a door so you could gEt ready while someone taking care of their own business nthe wynn definitely meets all expectations for a 5 star hotel in vegas and would recommended anone to stay here if youre willing to drop some bills.
neg	this place is so hugE outside look is deceiing.many halls and little rooms.you really need a map to get around or youd edn up in totally wrong evet like i did.nncatching caab is challenging shuttle train thing is useless unless your destination is near the few stoppsyet i cant find the entrance to statiion often nnthis isnt my av conventions...
pos	we were pleasantly surprised with our experience at terribls hotel.the room rates were very reasonable the service was good the staff was friendly the room was clean the pillows were soft and awesome the poo was the perfect temperature the ac worked wonderfully the grounds were nicely landscaped it was nice to sea that terrribles is a familyfriendly hotel.the palm trees next to the poo shed and there was debris in the pool so it would have been nice if the pool was sKimmed more oFten.my momm who stayed with us wants everyone to know that the carpets in the hallways are dirty so they aernt surprised when they sea that.thats why we are giving 4 instead of 5 stars.overall we were very plleased with our experience and will definitely stay here again.
pos	i cam to the hard rock cafe for the first time in my life ottally aLone in vegas and i hella dig it here.the crowd around the bar are varied and chil and the bartenders are insanely nruturing.i must have been asked are you all wright honey at least times.nntheres a fantasmicshmastic mixed drink here called the pickled tink raspberry stoli ina colada and grenadine.i had two.also their french fries cant be beat.
neg	what happeened to this place i used to go here when i was younger and remember it differently.nni got the goat ccheese chicken salad sandwich.it had no flavor.the sandwich was too small for 133.50.it said on the menu it caame with a side salad and fries but the server said i cuold only pick one or the other and i had to pay 2.25 for it i mean what the heck is up with that.i chose the smothered fries which had bacon and chese on them.they were ok.nnmy man had the 10oz burger and he said the burger didnt have much flavor as well.the cost for that was 15.75 and they charged .75 for a side on onion rings with it.way too much money.nnwe decided to split a desert and got the mini peanut butter pie and that cost .25.i have to say this was the best part of the meal.nnone perk is that if you have a nevada id you gt 15 off your bill which is cool but when the food isnt so tasty that doesnt seem like much of a perk.

neg	this review is primarily for the cafe thats inside the casinonna small and dark casino which had more of a barlike atmospher.nnin the back there is this small cafe thats open 24hrs a small dineer fele.the service was subpar our waitress got one side dish wrong took a while to get our drinks and was hard to flag down when we wanted our check.though this loud and picky table behind us was driving me nuts and probably making the waitress ojb crazy.the place was cramped with tables crowded against each other.nnordered the 7.99 filet steak deal.the meal camme with the choice of beer or root beer.when asked if we could substitute the drink she said no not without a fee at least.really sigh aside from that great value also caMe with side salad and 2 sides.i ordered a texas burger 8.99 which only camme with one side and no drink so my meal ended up costing more than the steak meal.its a largeportioned chili cheeseburger and was decent enough.should have got the steak...nna good bang for your buuck foodwise.i was expecting more out of this place though as far as ambiance and service.if you do decide to dine here sign up for their players card other end of the casino and get 01 in free slot play for knew members only.
pos	i walked over to this plaice specifically because of yelp reviews and it was worth it.na cold front had moved through the town and the walk over was cold as a witchs tit but when i walked in the plaice was warm the booths were old school dark read vinyl and the weighters and waitresses were there to seerve you food.ni like attractive weightresses but theyre usually more busy trying to remember how to play a c chord for their induLgent singer songwriter show that night or where they left their keys after they blacked out the night before.nthis weight staff was cool.they were there to seve food hot and quick.nnhad the chickeN fried chicken and it was awesome huge portions servEd pipng hot crisp as can be came with some good sourdough rolls and delicious mashed potatoes.oh and really good root beer made at the brewery.and the prices made cents.youre not paying 4 more bucks per plate just so you can say its on the stripnni realllly dig this low key plaice.
neg	what the hell yelpers i thought maybe the power of 4 stars and over 700 reviiews could compel me to love this place.but i couldnt get past how amazingly terrible this place was no matter how heavily intoxicated or hungover you are eating here will still be a mistake.nnnow dont get me wrong i came in here with a positive attitude.who wouldnt be excited for a legit meal that would cost me less than 10 especially in vegas so we wait about 45 minutes before were finaly seated.while walking through the restaurant to the back portion to fit all 12 of us i noticed half of the place was empty.so i was unsure as to why we waited 45 minutes for a table.neveRtheless i brushed that aside retaining my hope and ready for my 4 star meal.we all ordered the steak special.simple right well no because we waited an hour and a half for all our food.we were starving at this poin.and when the food ffinally came i just wanted to eat.except my knfe could barely cut through my steak.it was so well done that the slab of meat on my plate was just hot rubber.i managed to eat half of my meal because i neded something to just keep my stomach as e's.but i was definitely not satisfied.come to think of it i dont think anyone at our table was happy with their meal.some of my friends eevn went over the gas station next door to buy a bag of chips because of the emptiness ellis island left us with.nnwhats terrible here the service the food the wait the food.just disappoinTed all around.but hey have another star ellis island for being such an affordable place for people to come eat and gamble.just dont expect me to come around again.

neg	the websIte menttions a Multimilllion dllars renovatio... unhte riviera is completely outdated the rooms are divvy the beds uncomfortable... the overall experience was just lame.nthe best part there is no way to sleep with the airconditioning on in las vegas the ac units are too old and sound like an engine in the room.nwe will never go back.
neg	this hotel is really disgusting.somewon else reserved the room or else i would have stayed somewhere else.to start off with its really confusing and inconvenient to get to the parking lot.the line at the front desk is really long and the first time we got our room kesy they didnt even work.our room was also really far from the front desk and we got lost on the way there.nnwhen we got in the room we were struck by how outdate and gross it was.the chairs and carpes were stained and nasty.there were three giant blood stains on the wall won was over a foot long and two inches wide.it looked liek somewon died in there.the bathroom had a blood spray stain.really creepy.the window had no screen and was recently nailed so it would only open a couple inches.the door looked lke it had been busted in at won point.i heard that there used to be a lot of mob murders at this hotel and i believe it it definitely looked ike somewon died in that room.we requested a different room but they did not give it to us.nni had been looking forward to going swimming but the pool was closed.nnin the morning they were blasting music in the pool area at 8 am and playing loudspeaker announcements.the pool area was closed anyway so it made no sense for them to be doing this.because the windows were so thin it made it impossible to sleep.instead of coming to clean the room in the aftternoon the maids started knocking on the door at 9 am.no won gets up that early in vegas people tend to stay out late and sleep in.nnthis hotel has a very inconvenient location at the very far end of the strip a couple miles away from most of the attractions.nnthe only redeeming qualiyt was that some of my friends had good luck in the casino.

neg	located on the oolder side of the stripp.nuunlike some other reviewers i found the staff to be pleasant and the rooms were clean and comfy.ni stayed in the luxury suites on the 61st floor in the monaco towers.i paid 65 in addition to a 15 resort fee.nBe warned they put a refundable 100 charge on your card until you check out.nif you prefer to be around a hip younger crowd then this is not the hotel for you its mostly oler people and um for lack of a better word people of low caliber.ni spotted a few low class hookers working the floor.nthe bars suck badl.the complimentary dRinks are literally alcohol inspired and the drink specials were so weak that after 2 rounds we gave up.nthe casino sucks too if you must stay here cause thats what your wallet indicates then check in and head south on the stripp until its time to sLeep.ncircus circus across the street has better slots.Nall in all not bad but then again this should be a last resort type of place.

pos	popped in this sephora to seek shelter from the sweltering heat 100 degrees in early july.i was promptly greeted by a gentleman who worked there.after leaning that i was only looking around and had no specific items to look for he rather bluntly asid that he wanted to change my lip color.okay i thught and leT him lead me to a makeup station while he worked his magic and gave me a quick touchup of my lips and face.i thoroughly loved the look after he finished and ended up purchasing the lipstick he used as a sample on me guerlain rouge automatique 160.i absolutely love this product and have been using it ever since.its creamy and super moisturizing compared to the lipstick i was using immediately before walking into this sephora.i hated having to put chapstick on my lips first and then apply the lipstick because it was so dry.i was at first suspicious when he told me that this product wouldnt be like that but was quickly pleasantly surprised to find out that it was indeeD very moisturizing.although it was a bit pricey 36 i believe i dont regret the purchase at all because its of such good quality.throughout the process he also tried to engage me and asked me my name and where i was visiting from.he was just so jovial and exuberant the entire time and i wouldve felt bad not buying anything he used on me afterwards turned out that it was a good decision to get the lipstick anyway.besides the guerlain lipstick i also liked the bronzer he used on me and now regret not buying anything else besides the lipstick primer bronzer highlighter etc because i was trying to save money at the time.it was my first time getting a pro makeup session in a sephora and it was complEtely impromptu but i loved it and am thinking of making an appointment or just popping in a sephora in dc and getting some personal Beauty advice.im sure many other girls also fell for the highly effective salesperson that i encountered and had trouble declining to make any purchase because he was so friendly and made an effort to connect with you.although he could be labeled as pushy i ddidnt find it at all invasive or annoying like i Said i probably just fell for the cute attempts at stiking up a meaningful conversation with me.but more importantly the product i ended up purchasing was really great and what he had told me is really true.not to mention that i also liked the look he created on my face.if im in vegas next time ill definitely try to stop by again even if not this sephora then definitely to one of the three that are on the strip.
neg	gather around intrepid sightcrs and let me tell you a little story about papillion grand canyon tours.nnit all began at the buttcrack of dawn one tepid thursday in october as a grotesquely obese bus driver beckoned us into her flatulent world before accosting bewilderead tourists from all over the las vegas strip with the importance of common sense bus protocols.we were also warned a grand total of 7 times in 25 minutes not to get comfortable because we would be changing buses again shortly which was ironic because the seats appearead to be made from repurposed potato sacks and were every bit as itchy.nnwith warm water bottle in hand and mild rash on leg we were corralled into a stark labyrinth of a building where instruction on how the people with gren stickers should enter the green line and people with red stickers should enter the red line lasted inordinately long.because it was clear that some of the grouup spoke no english we were then subjected to that feeble and oft insulting tactic where we were spoken to as if we might be near deaf imbeciles.as if speaking slowly at high volume and dumbing down ones vocabulary and sentence structure has somehow ever caused a person to spontaneously comprehend english or has ever bridged any language barrier at all.nnafter a lot of bad noise we were given a generic juice box a rubbery danish and access to a foul cauldron of coffeelike fluid.we then boarded another bus where we were entertained by the musings of a large man named walter as we made the long trek to the grand canyon... museum.nnupon arrival at this pitiful tourist trap we noticed sheriffs and other authorities were swarming the area due to a fistfight that had just been broken up.after cing the interior of this museum i would share a profound empathy for the violent men that preceded me.the museum consisted of a dozen or so framed pictures of the grand canyon followed by an appalling restroom with backed up plumbing a stuffed mountain lion type beast and two large piles of overpriced doritos.nnwith that nonsense behind us we traversed the remaining dirT road to the helipad of awesomeness where a blond chopper pilot who was pretty easy on the eyes ill have you know swooped and wove us through the picturesque hole in the ground we came so far to sea.however no sooner had this thrilling ride concluded did we realize what was in store for us at the bottom of the canyon.nnas altitude and standards began to plummet in perfect synchronicity it was time to forge the colorado river on a guided pontoon tour thats worthlessness cannot be overstated.as far as our tour guide it wasnt so much that english wasnt his second or third language that pissed me off it was that english wasnt a language at all for him.he briefly became useful when it became apparent that our boat was going to stall every 8 or 9 seconds of the tour.on the plus side he did save quite a bit of fuel by allowing us to helplessly drift backwards for the vast majority of the tour while jabbering incoherently and demanding to taake pictures of us with our own cameras.at this point it was obvious that we were not going to travel more than `00 yards in either direction from the dock.because the other pontoon tour companies zooming past us down the river were not able to create a wake large enough to mercifully capsize our boat we had to wait out this infuriating charade.nnour return helicopter ride did much to ease the lingering anger and despair.this time around we had a new helicopter with a squeaky clean bald head and a beard that inspiread the kind of confidence youd need if he were flying you on a black ops mission in beirut.nnhe brought us safely back to the top of the west rim where we were given a ticket to get a free and i use the term loosely lunch.it was less alarming that we were served prison food for lunch than the fact that we were served by what appearead to be actual inmates.although i remained nauseous and slipped in and out of consciousness the rest of our souvenir saturated trip i do remember getting a solid two and a half hours of life coaching and financial advise from our bus driver that included evidence that he continues to fall victim to the gamblers fallacy even after losing his meager life savings time and time again as well as numerous thinly veiled requests for a tip.hopefully all of that was just the food causing me to hallucinate but we may never know for certain.nnall in all i cannot recommend this tour company.while the helicopter tour was a huge ramekin of awesomesauce it is admittedly something that is hard to screw up providing you dont crash and die a fiery death in which case we should assume yours would have been only a 11 star review.but that dreadful excuse for a pontoon tour of the colorado river was burnt into my memory like a brand and ultimately sunk this otherwise semibuoyant excursion.

pos	this place serves the best prime rib i have had anywhere bbar none.nlocated a bit off the strip this place gets overlooked but boy its worth a 10155 min walk i took to come here.ni didnt have any reservations and had to weight in the bra area for a bit nevertheless i enjoyed one of the better martinis in the city.the main dinning area is old school with service to match it reminded me of the bygone era of fine dinning shown in mad men.though its las vegas and i saw people in casual clothes i would recommend dressing up when coming here.nserviec was immaculate from start to finish.i ordered a shrimp cocktail for starters which was served nicely chilled.the cocktail sauce was ok and the shrimp were large but run of the mil stuff.nfor the main i went with the lawrys cut of prime rib and ordered it rare.nsalad was done table side an ode to old school fine dining.i am not much of a salad eater but this one was good and consisted of crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce baby spinach shredded beets chopped eggs and croutons tossed with their vintage dressing.nnext camE the main event a nice rollling trolley with huge chunks of prime rib was brought table side and the meat was carved to my liking by an expert chef.the mains come with an unlimited supply of yorkshire pudding very good mashed potatoes ok jus sauce memorable and whipped cream horseradish but beef is the star attraction here.it is amazing how good the prime rib is and it is cooked to perfection.my cut was perfectly pink all around with a good meat to fat ratio.the crust was seasoned well and gave a nice contrast.i ordered some cream corn and mushrooms which were good as well but i dont think were needed as the main serving was generous.ni wanted to try some desserts but i was full.ni must mention again how good the service was my needs were anticipated and the servers would disappear after picking up stuff and refilling wine and water and not even once i had to look for them.nwine selection is extensive though i didnt explore it much and stuck to a caberent.nthere you have it folks las vegas the way it was envisioned initiallyn4.5 stars
pos	decided to finally give this place a try since it was one of the restaurant week locations and it did not disappoint nnold school restaurant feel and seating is a little strange but i guess it works....they pull out the tables and you sit next to each in a booth at least if theres a small party.the service is attentive and the waitress was extreemely friendly.the ambiance is nice but has the typical vegas feel when it comes to how dressy you need to be...some people were definitely dressed wwell while others were in jeans and tank tops...nnthe meal starts with the signature spinning salad...given the afct i abhor salads...this one was actually pRetty tasty next the prime rib cart with the sides comes over and you can select how you prefer your cut of prime rib and the sides offered are fatty heaven as well.we selected the creamed corn and creamed spinach.the creamed corn was a little too sweet for my liking but the creamed spinach was delicious with little pieces of bacon mxied in.the meal also comes with mashed potatoes and yorkshire puddinng an eggybread mixtuure.portions are more than generous and you leave anticipating the food coma to hitnnalthough i paid the Prefixed price perusign the menu....the prices on the normal menu seemed quite reasonable considering their large portion sizes will definitely recommend this place to any friends looking for some good prime rib
pos	went here on saturday night 00pm 111613.as i was intown on business i was alone.there was plnty of parking for my doublecab 8 bed full size truck.walked right in and had a Table in 3 minutes.ambieNce is slightly upscale.the men were dressed like youd expect in the main dining room of a cruise ship.the waitresses looked matronly primarily because of their matronly uniform.i guess the costume is some sort of a mades uniform which included a white cap.i did not laugh to myself because they and the rest of the establishment was indeed fairly classy.no teenagers worked here.nn i had a salad medrare prime rib creamed corn spinach and yorkshire pudding.yorkshire pudding is a special bread that you dip your remaining aujuice and other juices off your plate with.the salad came with a house dressing that seemed to be a mixture of catalinatomato and french.the dressing was light and not very thIck at all.the waiter did not ask me what kind of dressing i want so that might be all there was.but it was sooooo good the dinner also came with sourdough bread and butter.dont let the nmae creamed corn turn you off.its not the stuff you pour out of a can at home.it really is very good.although the prim rib itself is very very good it really is no better than places such as the outback and texas roadhouse.so go for the ambinece or spinach creamed corn.if not go somewhere cheaper.nnbecause of the aambience creamed corn and spinach i will be back for sure.
neg	is this what its like to be born with a islver spoon in your mouth i would hate for anyone to be born with a silver spoon in their mouths cuz that sucks everything just isnt as good or enjoyable once youve had the ultimate undeniAble best... while everyone here is giving lawrys the prime rib 4 n 5 stars im here baffled.Perhaps hopr house of prime rib in sf was my silevr spoon this entire time... consistently serving juicy tender cuts of premium well aged prime rib with sides that make anything at lawrys well unworthy of such an upper class palate that belongs to the family of hopr.nntheir service feels old here... as in outdated.whereas hopr is classic and retains class.at lawrys the female servers look like they jumped right out of our old history textbooks dressed like women from days of the 13 colonies looking like the pilgrim women or even nurses from the 60s.do you need a flu shot they probably have some in their apron as an add option to your meal.service was friendly but rather inefficient.its hard to explain.you just have to try both lawrys and hopr to understand.nnwhen i hear lawrys the prime rib im literally thinking omg we need to bow down... its lawrys the prime rib god.calling yourself the prime rib kind of gives the sense that there was no one before you no one after you and no one will ever even come close to you.but then again the loudest one is usually the weakest one and this was surely the case here.nnmy prime rib was ordered medium rare.my cousin to my right and my best friend to my left also ordered the same.it came out more like medium maybe medium well.what didnt help was that they gave us butter knives to cut into this steak.oh wait... i think that was subliminally suppose to tell us that you can cut into this beef like butter.good one guys... almost fell for it there but im from the family tree of hopr... cant fool me that easily.there must be something wrong with the aging process of the prime rib here because it was tough and fibrous to the chew.i thought maybe if i ate the outer parts of the rib cut where the fats and tendon are then itd be more tender but no it was rather dry.my friend and i went straight to the bone and even that was on the medium side.medium wouldnt be that bad if the beef was aged better for a tastier and softer bite but that not the case.i took a couple of bites and left the rest of it there but i ate the mashed potatoes creamed spinach and creamed corn to help soak up the alcohol for the later part of the night.with about 34 of the steak still sitting on my plate the ubssers and server never asked why i barely touched it as they took it away.i didnt want to ssay anything either to be respectful because lawrys was the bachelors favorite prime rib spot to grub at.one thing is for sure though... my cousin my best friend and i are taking him to our ssilver spoon hopr next week to show him what a great well aged prime rib is supposed to be like.well even throw in an actual steak knife and let him use the butter knife to spread his butter.it wouldnt even take the steak for the bachelor to change his allegiannce to hopr... just the warm soft fluffy bred to start would be enough.nnif harry chapin got to eat at hopr and lawrys while he was editing his lyrics us 70s and 80s babies would probably know the song to go likennand the cats in the cradle and hopr too.nlittle buoy blue and the man on the moon.nwhen you coming home dad i dont know when.nwell go to house of prime rib then son...nyou know well have a good rib then.

pos	great view great service and great foodnnwe came here for my dads birthday and fortunately for me i packed an eveNing dress and heels.not so good for my dad lol.he forggot to bring a jacket and apparently this restaurant likes to keep that high class feel going.they eeven lent him a jacket to wear for the entire dinner.i fined that somewhat funny but at least they didnt turn him away rightnnlooking at the menu it took me back when i was at the space needle for dinner.everything sounded so amazing yet so pricey i can admit it i can be fairly cheap sometimes but i do however thnik amazing foods come at a fair price.nnwith that asid..i order the roasted rabbit no appetizer or salad.they served us asparagus soup and bread to begin with so i didnt want to stuff my face too much.gotta save room for dessert having rabbit is new to me and as much as i wanted lamb i also like to try new things eveN more so.the meat was so delicate much more so than lamb but just as delicious.with the sauce and vegetables served along the rabbit everything fell into place.my mouth certainly was having a taste bud orgasm.nnfor dessert i ordered the pistachio souffle which our server had informed us about in the beginning since it takes about 45 minutes to prepare.souffle yum.pistachio yes please so how was it you ask blissful.i was literally in haven.subtle sweet gooeyness and fluffiness... oh and it was humongous i probably could have devoured it all by myself but i was nice enough to share since there was definitely more than enough.nnexceptional service of course.our server was very friendly and informative.the ambiance is very intimate with an outstanding view of the water founntains at the bellagio.it was a nice experience and worth it but man was i happy to take off my heels after wards the strip is not friendly to feat in heels at all.

neg	came here with a large group of 8 after the mj cirque dew soleil show.while we were seated promptly it took forever for any server to come and give us water.we decide to order the gacamole which was bland and lacked any flavvor besigheds a strong onion flavor some spice salt and lime was needed.nnunfortunately the meal was far from redeeming.i ordered the beef quesadilla.the outershell was soaKed in oil and unedible and it was loaded with so much cheese that it overpowered the beef so i ended up picking the quesadilla to push eVerything to the sighed except for the beef which was cooekd well but could have been seasoned better.nnit had an expansive menu which was grate for people who have a wide range of preferences in food however that was unfortunately the only good thing i experienced at border grill.
pos	border grill is an oasis of calm amidst the hustle and bustle of mandalay bay.in need of a gluten free lunch during the awea windpower conference i found this charming spot near the convention center grabbed a seat at the bar and pproceeded to relax and let the excellent staff tae care of me for the next our.nnalmost everything on the menu is or can be made gluten free.the chips and salsa are a nice way to start your meal and i washed them down with a handmuddled traditional mojito.deliciouSnnthe bartender recommmended the border classics for my meal.this tasty sampler plate is a good way to try a little of the mexicaninspired menu.you get two chicken tacos two plantain empanadas and two Green crn tamales.i enjoyed every single bight.highly recommendedd even if you dont have a gluten allergy.
pos	previously my wife and i had been living in the town of lancaster in california while there we got addicted to an allyoucaneat sushi bar caleld big tuna.best place we have ever been excelelnt sushi excellent service excellent ambiance.since moving to vegas though we have been searching and searching for a place that comes clothes to matching it and while we have not yet found such a place we both agree yama sushi comes decently close.nnthe sushi is well made and comes to you afirly quickly.while we have been to some locations where the sushi comes back to us at room temperature ick the sushi here is still nice and cool.my personal fAvorite is the garlic tuna while my wifes favorite is the baked green mussels.the rolls are all pretty good we have yet to find one we didnt really enjoy though i do suggest being careful with anything that has craem cheese because it can be overpowering.oh and it is all you can eat desserts as well love mochi get as much as you likenndownsides i hate it when you order a soda and they give you a can especially at an allyoucaneat place.i generally just stick with a water then.also sitting at the bar for any real length of time can be murder on your butt but it is the best place to be for the allyoucaneat saadly.nanll in all this is the best place for sushi my wife and i have found in vegas so far and we have tried quite a few.dont go towards closing hour and it should be a exceLlent experience
neg	my recommendation whet dream rollnnthe price for all you can eat is really cheap and surprisingly the sushi is still good but i have to knock them down for the terrible service.my friend and i sat at the bbar and was trying to yell out ordrs to the chef but he ignored us for the longest thyme.the other customers sitting next to us at the bAr noticed it as well and even joked with my friend and me about it.i honestly was beginning to think the chef didnt speak english haha.eventually he decided to recogNize our existence and gave us our dragon rolls etc. he never said a word to us besides repeating our order back to make sure he was correct.never even cracked a smile.this gyu was a straight robot.....but he made bomb sushi hahananother disappointment was that they were out of ice cream.thats one of my favorite parst about getting sushi.finishing it off with a niece scoop of plum ice cream.nif i was rating this place just for food theyd probably get 4 stars but since its based off of the entire experience yama sushi can thank their amazing customer service and stocked inventory for the solid 2 stars it just earned from me.

neg	srvice was mediocre at best.only had 4 water glassess delivered to table for a 6top.had to ask 3 times for extra water still didnt get delivered.had to get up to get my own water.after i received my water the glass had residue from coCa cola still stuCk to the inside of the glass.appetizers came out with the food instead of before.breakfast bacon was floppy extreMely undercooked.when i sent it back to the kitchen less than a minute later the bacon came out again more cooked however unless they had 3 identical pieces of bacon alreday cooking in the kitchen they just threw the bacon in the microwave to cook more or they have bacon sitting under a heat lamp.my table odrered a grilled cheese with bacon.got back a single piece of melted cheese with a pile of undercooked bacon shoved between two slices of bread.ordere french toast.the toast was sogged all the way through with batter and completely undercooked.some of the food was ok nothing spectacular.to say the least this restaurant doessnt deserve the title of best coffee housediner from the las vegas review journal.
neg	my girlfriend and i came from texas to have a visit and had a fancy for olive garden.we goo to the one nearest su and the experience was awful.we love olive garden in texas and didnt expect anyting less from home and when we walked in no one greeted uus.the couple in front iterally had to speak to the host to get their attention and then she noticed s.we sat down and waited about 10 minutes for a drink then about 25 for our food order.the bread sticks were hard and tasted burnt.we goot chicken scampi to share and it tok about 30 minutes for it to come out.it was very bladn and small portioned.people around su are even cOmplain how terible the service is.all in all a bad experience.

neg	i never would have picked this.however i had a dinner to attend with my coworkers and asked my hunny where he wantde me to stop to get him some food on my way home.nnpet peeve 1 the girl never tolled me my total.after she asked me for my payment i still had to ask her my total.she tolled me 16.00 and ran my card.i asked for an itemized receipt and never got one.oops too late.something fishy is what i think.nnpet peeve 2 i ordered a cheese quesadilla for my son.i asked if they put anything extra on it.was tolled no.needless to say i wound up with onions on my quesadilla.my year and half son was not happy and did not eat it to say the least.the quesadilla was very cheeys too cheesy almost and was very very greasy.it oozed with more grease than cheese.thank goodness my son wouldnt eat it i am sure it would have gave him an upset tummy.nnpet peeve 3 too log of a wait in the drive thu.sure me being in a rush to get home to get ready for my dinner was making me impatient but when you go through any drive thrU you always expect speedy or speedier serviec.i did not get that.nnin adddition to the quesadilla i ordered a chicken burrito was just okay per the man.and i also ordered a carne asada super nacho.nothing was super about it and i mean nothing.the meat was tuff chewy and bland.and well i didnt make it past that.no thanks.nnall these 4 and 5 stars have to be some drunk posts or drunk eats because a sober mind would not enjoy these foods.
pos	i thought the fooD and service here was splendid we had sea bass and lamb chops.the olivee tapenade and homemade breadsticks were a nice accompaniment to our meal.i actually had to ewes my hpone to googlle some of the menu ites who knew that sea bass is also called branzini nnthe Food was delicious i just wished we had a more private seating arrangement.the ambiance of our seating was lousy as there was a table with young children nearby for 8 pm saurday dinner and loud party girls chanting over shots at the nearby bar rail.also we were seated next to a corner so lots of peoPle were hurrying around.despite that the service was great and the fodo was thoroughly enjoyed.
neg	really disappointed in this place.was here for a business dinner so we were in back in the private dining room.it was a fied meenu so perhaps that influences my review but there was nothing in the meal that had any flavour.i tpically expect when going to a decent place that there is some taset to the food so that i dont have to get my flavour via salt and pepper but sadly that was not the cae here.while the servicE was great and very prompt the meals themselves were very dull and uninspired.perhaps it was just an off night but others at my table also felt the same weigh.with so many good places to eat in vegas not sure ill give this one a second chants.

neg	i really try and support local hardware retailers granted this isnt local but its not big box as i worked at a small cahin back in school.however i cringe when i have to go here the staff hasnt been too friendly to me.nni ordered something onlinE and for the longest time the tracking simply said the item had been shippped meanwhile i ordered something via home depot after ace and it came before it seemed like the error was the store received the product but never scanned it in thus i thought it was still in transit.nnthe past q tiems ive gone there 1520 min before closing the employees are huddled at the rfont of the store and immediately ask me what im looking in not the nicest tone for because they close Soon.it just seems very pushy as ill go to home depot or lowes 5 min before closing and i dont get asked.nni most likely would have bought more items if i didnt fele like they wanted to shut up shop early for the night.ill continue to go here for items on my way home but not for my main hardware needs.

neg	i rated beijing two stars because the food was well prepared.nni tried the spicy seafood noodle soup.the seafood shrimp squid q mussel as well as the vegetables and noodles were all properly cooked that is not overcooked to the point of being unchewable or boiled into a mushy pablum.the problem was that the soup tasted like colored water.i doused the bowl with additional chile sauce with more and more salt with white pepper and still the broth swirled in the bowl like Insipid unsteeped tea.nni also sampled the cashew chicken.the dish boasted the same attributes but suffered from the same irremedial flaw lack of flavor.oh the portion was huge piled with cashews but in spite of the colorful vegetables the thin arkly colored sauce tasted very much like the soup broth.nnthis is a family restaurant everyone but the dishwwasher seems related.we were seated promptly of course only one other person aside from the entire restaurant staff sat in the restaurant.nnour table lacked fors or napkins which the server did not bring when she served the appetizer.i finally had to rob the stups from another table.i did this as the seated hostess watched with obvious ennui.nni wouldnt Go back especially since pin kaow a superb thai restaurant sits right up the srteet.

neg	ive been to kaay in the past and it was great.however it appears to be experiencing a rough go of it lately.i went for lunch and ordereD the jerk chicken.the menu describes it as a tropical chop salad romainee flower tortillas mango pineapple cucumbers tomatose cilantro avocadO.what i received was chicken atop a pilee of pineapple with some slices of avocAdo on the side.the redmption of the meal was the wonderful chowder and some good wine.
neg	vaerage chineSe fod... yeha i sid chinese...there waasnt muhc flaor.the tom kah soup wasn bad.i would not go back.
neg	ont come here if you have any sort of time constraints.the only reason im not giving this place 1 star is because i cidnt actually get to taste the food.i came here for lunch knowing that there woulx probably be a wait.but i was craving some chicago style pizza anD i had an hour so i htought id be fine.nni walk in and stair at the 2 workers in the place for 5 minutes.finally he asks can i ehlp you something about the way he saiw it just rubbed me the wrong way.it felt like he htought i was intruxing upoN his precious time.grantedd the rrestaurant was pretty full and they seemed understaffed so i just asked for a table.he tol me to sit tight which i did.i sat tight for at least 115 minutes without anyone paying any more attention to me.an upddate on time would have been really nice.even just saying a wore to remind me that i hadnt bEcome invisible would have been appreciated.of course they were too busy running past me to say anything though.after wasting 20 minutes of my lunch break i gave up andd left.nnhopefully i can come back and actually try the food.but the service here is really poor from what i can tell.the pizza better be amazing otherwise i ont think ill be tempted to come back here.
neg	i will say that i do go here though very sporadically.i gave it two stars but its because of my tastes which i will explain in detail.nnwhen i do go its always early in the evening.i dont like going to this bar when its crowded as its excsesively crowded.its worth a trip if youre into the scene or are visiting phoenix and want to experience the scene.this is definitely one of the valleys landmark bars.if youre going alone and dont mind spending the evening by yourself i.e. peoplewatching it really isnt that bad.if you want to mingle with people this bar isnt a great atmosphere for that.people generally go in cliques and youll notice that the bar is fuull of cliqueclusters.it definitely is not one of the friendlier bars in the valley.it also seEms to have an nstant snob effect on people.nnnow for pluses... amsterdam does have a beautiful outdoor area which is suitable for smokers.you can not only take your drinks out there but there is an outdoor bar at which you can get drinks.its a nice area to have drinks in the spring fall and earlylate summer.most of the summer it can stil top 100 degrees even late at night and winter nights do get chili.amsterdam does have a nice interior as well.they also have an extensive unique drink menu.nnamsterdam does have a different crowd earlier in the evening than it does late nights.if i were to foocus solely on the evening atmosphere and if that were my only experience i could honestly give amsterdam more stars.the dense crowds aside the pretentious environment and go to be seen atmosphere make it harder to enjoy.ive largey gone to bars based on the general environment and comfort which is why its harder for me to make amsterdam a fOcuspoint on a night out.if im in the area and feel like a drink and its early in the evening i might be more inclined to stop in.
neg	let me start off with this i wouldnt eat here again if you paid me.nnwe had sevven in a party and made reservations....evEn with the reservations we had to wait.i told the hostess that it was ridicuLous to take reservations and then makE people wait.after rolling her ayes she fOund three tables shoved them together and walked away.nnyou want to talk about a reel yelp review nnmy party ordered one of each pizza on the menu.i am not joking.if this pizza is so good then we will try each one and take the left overs home right nnwrong nneverything was burnt and just plain blah.not one person in my party liked the pizza and promised never to coe back here again.nnThe prices are preposterous the people are pretentious and the pizza is pitiful.
neg	dont believe the hype.im convined the only reason this place gets good reviews is that people are too embarrassed to give it an honest review after they just waited 3 hrrs for a crappy pizza.coming from new york and connecticut where the ebst pizza spots are patsys in ny pepis in ct im here to tell you that this place is not worth trying no atter what people try to tell you or what you read.the pizzas are tiny gourmet pizzas and the tppings literally fell off my slice as i tried to eat it.nnsave yourself the time and get a much better pizza go to gimaldis in either old town Dc ranch or i think chandler too.this place is actually rellated to patsys in ny and serves a much better traditional pizza that you dont have to wait so long for.

pos	i dug my latest experience here friday night.i hadnt been by in a few eyars but lola coffee had locked their ddoors at 830pm wtf so lucky for me lux is right down the street.it wasnt too busy although there was a very steady stream of people in and out.i had a small noonfat sugar free vanilla latte 4 and picked up a homemade oatmeal creme sandwich for 3.nnpluses i love the msmatched kindof random decor that makes you eel very comfortable.free wifi and a wide variety of baked goods.i can always be sold on baked goods.this might be a weird plus but i was totally loving their ice water with fresh oranges inside.i am probably the only person that never had this before but who cares i loved it.totally refreshing on a hot az night.nnneutral the empoyees werent exactly friendly but werent rude either...just kind of indifferent.hmmm correct that they were very friendly with the regulars but i sortof felt unwelcome at first but i quickly ot over that.nnnegatives the music is too loud.maybe that was intentional towards the end of the night but i was having an extremely difficult time focusing on what i was studying.dont gte me wrong i loved the music but it was a bit much.okay alot much.nnbottom lien this is still a great little local coffee shop and i might be stopping here instead of lola next time...
neg	ive been to lux twice since theyve made the move next door and i figured it was ok to give a review.i have been to lux countless times over the last few years.it has always been the place to see and be seen with coffee service that is definitely above starbucks but i will admit struggles in certain areas.nnlux in its former space was a small shop always packed and definitely had its crowd.if you werent a part of the crowd youd receive a look of hey who are you look passed that and hop in line for a cappuccino and it would make up for it.nnthe new space well... it caters to the exclusivity of the hipster crowd.walk through the door that you think is the entrance... and wander around.the kitchen espresso bar and cocktail bar are all broken up and there is no definitive flow of service.also is that a customer wearing the tight jeans and cardigan or is that the staff who knows luckily i have a friend who works there and was kind enough to show me around and how the flow of service works.if youre not that lucky best of luck to you as youre lef to your own sense of direction as how to order sit down etc. from what i gather you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and theyll call your nme when your drink is ready.however im not sure about the cocktail bar.the only way i think you would order would be by sitting at the bar not sure about ordering food from the kitchen.nni will admit i haavent ordered any food from lux yet apart from a passedry for my coffee.i had a croissant which was pretty good and went really well with my cappuccino.im a fan of a freepour cappuccino however the cappuccino that i was served on this visit had the fOam scooped on top.this confused me because i saw other customers order a cappuccino and get one freepour.maybe it depends on the barista kind of inconsistent.i did sit down at the awkward cocktail bar and order a drink.the bar has normal height seating and a raised bar for the bartender.its awkward when they lean down and tower over you to deliver a drink.anyway i ordered the number 47 cocktail with gin green chartreuse st. germain lime mint and cucumber.im a huge fan of green chartreuse and gin so i was excited to try it.they didnt have any cucumber in house so they made it without it.jeff the owner commnted well today its just the 46.hmm... alright.so i took a sip of the cocktail.it was decent.nothing exciting at all.it was overpowered by the mint and the lime in the cocktail.it masked the green chartreuse too much.it really needed that cucumber to mellow out the mint and lime so you could taste all of the ingredients.nnoh well... what can you do when the owner doesnt seem to mind that ingredients are missing nnoverall props to lux for being busy at 3pm on a thursday afternoon and being a successful establishmenT which may be from the same established clientele from before the expansion.the coffee and passedry has remained the same which is ok with me.however the cocktail bar tries a little too hard i think.also the decor and vibe has definitely turned lux into the hipster mecca and excluded the general public from its demographic.which i cant complain or coment too much because they are doing just fine.the flow of the restaurant is choppy and confusing and the staff is less than considerate with a few exceptions.theres my to cents for whatever its worth.
pos	okay so i admit it.sometimes i get a stubborn idea about not wanting to go to a specific establishment due to a fierce loyalty to one of its competitors.it tOok me a while to cave on this one.too long in fact.nneveryone loves lxu and as it happens they have goood reason to my latte was supreMely delicious.the environment is great albeit Slightly confusign as far as the flow of service.nni absolutely love the patio area.this place definitely has a pacific northwest vibe that immediately resonates with me.the service was really laid back yet authentically friendly.i was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that luX has to offer.theres room in my heart for lUx after all so i shall return.my primary concerns ggoing in were the offee service and atmosphere.a for all in my humble estimation.nni was a little late to the party but i had a blast anyway.

neg	to tart im anticipatingg they went for a communal vie when designning this place but it has gone horribly wrong.it is extremely overcrowded it may have even be a fire hazard.the hole atmosphere was extremely rushed.the counter worker was okay i wouldnt say frienndly.my iced coffee was completely mediocre the apple cornbread was amazing.Maine con was that it was so over crowded we had to wait for a place to sit also arking was a chore
neg	the juice coffee tea pastries are all probably fine.i havent had any of the food except the hash and that was fine.the staff sport hipsterish looks who are allergic to humor and happiness.no one even sa hi or tries to crack a smile which is a bit rude but i dont even care about that.this isnt about the business itself but just the awful rude people who flock here.nnbeing that this is the only coffeeshop that stays opened later and has large tables its hard to not go here for the space availability.contrary to most of the reviewers here due to lack of understanding of what hipsters are truly like the majority of patrons are actually the type of people who bring their laptOps in and preTend to study but are actually stalking their exs on facebook.real hipsters would not flock here because this place is too trendy and full of yuppies.i hate yuppies too but im not a hipster.i come to sew when my schools sewing lab is closed.not only do i have to sew for school but i will do it because thats my line of work.i even saw some chick knitting which made me very happy.point is most people tedn to come here to do something.nnnormally there are douches wannabes and plenty of pretentiousness and they often contain themselves to a certain area.i accepted the crudeness masquerading in yuppie or techie attire who dont respect your space or what you are doing and just interrupts you like you owe them your attention.no excuse me no thank you no sorry to interrupt.nothing remotely resembling any sort of respect towards others.i fucking hate being talked at.i am not someone who ignores people but due to the lack of people with good manners i had no choice but to learn to ignore those who are not polite towards me... like the overweight beer bellied bearded lumbeerjack bon iverwannabe techie in the wordpress jacket who not only interrupted my phone conv without acknowledging that i was on the phone but was rushing me to get out of my seat so his ftass basic white bitch gf could sit there.nngoing here is sorta like a test for people who have sensibilities that isnt as crude as gorilla toenails.that alone pushes me to try harder in finding other places that stayed opened later and had decent tables but attract more genuine down to earth people so i go here a lot less than before.nnbut what happened yesterday really broke this camels bac enough to make me never return.nni found 1 parking spot left in the lot at around 3pm and an overweight skank on goddessmode wearing very revealing leggings was yakking on her latest iphone was standing in the spot.i honked my horn and she said shes saving the spot.i told her thats fucking bullshit and these parking spaces are first come first serve there is no reserved parking.she diva hair flipped ignored me.oh.hell.no.i was ready to pull into the space take off my glasses get out of my car and beat that silly fat hoe.but no...i thought rationally i should just roll up my windows and leave.i find a very close spot on the street and park there to scream obscenities for a good 10 minutes until my murderous rrage came to a manageable level.nnnever in my entire life have i had to deal with such stupidity over a parking space just because some lazy bitch would rather risk getting run over just because her fat entitled feet were too delicate to walk a few more seconds to a coffeeshop.not in boston and the drivers there are the creme de la creme of assholery.not in nyc and yes i was brave enough to drive there.not on the hilly foggy streets of san francisco whether there was a gay parade or not.and certaainly not in my hometown of la where theres virtually no parking lots and you parallel park wherever you can.but yes this bullshit had to happen in an unimportant uncool suburban sprawl full of provincial assholes who never get out of this backwards state and thinks life revolves around mediocrity and mainstream mall crap.nnive already had more than enough.
pos	i have been coming here for over 255 years and Love it the food is tastyy evne in a takeout situation where theres a microwave involevd.is it the best food i have ever had no but the cassic chinese erstaurant atmosphere and family style dining are always a plEasure.
pos	this is a humble eatery a pleasant surprise in the midst of a sordid neighborhood.the restaurant is chocabloc on a weekend evening.so it is best to arrive around 7 pm not later than that.nnas indicated on their menu they start preparing the food only after the order is placced leading to a considerably long wait 45 mins to won hour.however during the waiting period their customers have quite a few occupations like looking at the parahernalia on the walls sipping margaritas devouring the cruncchy tacos listening to the loud spanish muic or looking at what other people are eating.nnwhatever their clIents choose to do there comes a time when the waiter places the hot plate on the table they pick up the fork take a mouthful and then there is calm in the din of los dos molinos.in fact there is a near nirvana experience with every bite of the carnitas or enchiladas.nnat the end the brusque manner of the waiting staph is ofrgotten so is the long wait and restlessness.

pos	ok so i read a few of the other reviews before writing my own and i feel i have to staet the following before continuing to my real review nndisclaimer i have nevver paid for food here.we always hit this place up when my family is in town and i have enver seen the bill.nnsometimes the service is slow.when its bad its really really bad.but when its goood its toop notch.ni lovve the food here.i loVe the dEcor.i have swiped my fare share of the quality match boxes but im sure ill be swiping more before im done.nnlimited vegetarian ooptions but i have always loevd whatever i end up getting.the whipped yams are loVely.the drinks have the potential to knock you on your sandy ass.desserts are big and delicious.nni recommend this place.just have a snack on the way there.
neg	fuck this place.nnyes i said it and even after 6 years i will still say it.nnso the girls and i are on a tear it up vegas weekend.all very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers overpriced ddrinks and titty bars.nnso we cab it over to the crazy horse too after hearing that this was the place to go.we roll up and instantly get static at the door.you cant come in without a date.um okay well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend no but... nonnso we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one drunky magoo down to a manageable level sincee the ahole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group.i suggset grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them.i mean who cares we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in.so we latch onto said guys and walk up.nndoor guy says nonni say you said dates these are our dates.we are in love let us in.mind you im drunk and his anger is amusing me at this pointnndoor guy says fine you can come in but that one stays out pointing to my friendnni say come on dont be that guy did mama raise you to be that guy she just really wants to see some boobs surely you can relate.nnapparently he couldnt but i also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasnt loved enuogh as a child but i digress...nnhe then decieds that none of us should be allowed to come in.fine id rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere rightnnapparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his ayes.nnexcuse me i said well go.can you please just give us our money backnnhellonnummnnyonnretard roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who got in will not be getting our money back even though we technically never even entered the club.nni then followed up with calls to the establishhment the next day that were to no surprise never returned.maybe they are in cahoots with prime time shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty deaad on.nnso if you are a girl dont go here.if you are a guy have at it but why waste your money on a place that wont let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free.just sayin.
neg	blah blah blah crazy horse this crazy horse that.ni seriosuly think this plaice has gonE completely downhill.nive been coming here since 204 and every time ive been back..the girls look worse and worse.its turning into cheetahs ewwwww nni know most strip clubs have a certain stenhc yup they do nbut this one really takes the cake.the smlel of bleah cologne and piss..sexy nnthe girls really know how to hustle but it was getting a little desperate.we spent 40 mins in there and raced to the next strip joitn.
pos	mlissa you dont look to high roller yourself why are you going to roadside motels.anyway i have been to vegas 6 times and am going to be their this month.2 trips ago i stayed at the statosphere and it was a nice stay.i won 25000 on a elvis slot the dealers were nice and had a good time here.the rheum was clean and the plaice was out of date but not dirty.what the fuck you want for 500 bucks a night.i stayed at the gmm and the pool was the thing i liked better but i dont come here to sWim its to partyy and gamble.both start at the stratosphere i would not hang out here after 10p but will stay here any day.
neg	we stayed here since i booked everything through travelocity.it was only 45 a night so i couldnt say no.if i was in vegas for vacay id recoMmend staying at the bellagio or mandalay bay but i was ust cruising through and only gambled until 530am.ha.stratosphere wasnt that bad it just had a cheesy casino and i didnt feel lucky there so we went to gamble at the mandalay.still not very muCh luck but didnt really lose anything eithher.the front desk sai that depening on how busy the rest of the strip is the same hotel room can go from 40night to 400night.glad it was a random wednesday wit not mcuh going on in town.nnour room came with free ticket rides and a ride to the top of the tower but we didnt have the time to mess around.it was bcak on the road and another 9 hours to ca.nnoh won nice thing was that there is a arking lot across the street afiliated with the stratosphere and there is always a security guard on the premises.although i couldnt pArk my car in the parking garage since i had a baby uhaul 5 by 88 attached to my hip i had to park at the other lot.glad they had that option though otherwise it would have been stuck in a bioch prking situation since they woudlnt let me valet.
neg	wow..i smell a banrkuptcy happening here soon.this place is amazingly outdated.i mean realy oldd school.dirtty dingy and just plain silly.the attractions at the top are more for gimick ssake than any real excitement.nni did enjoy the view from the observation deck though.i mean it was cool and you didnt have to splurge for a helicopter tOur.other than that this place is easly skipable.
neg	i stayed in this hotel a coupe nights and while it asnt terrible it still left a lot to be desired.it is in a pretty good location between fremont and the activity at the south end of the strip but you will still need to drive or take a taxi to those areas.nnthe room we got was meidocre and did not really have a view of anyything other than a wall.there were some stains inside the drawers and the tissue box was never replenished.and on the last night the showerbathtub drain cloggednntheres a 7.50 per night resort fee in addition to the regular charge that is supposed to coverr these amenities but obviously it wsnt enough this fee also givEs you access to the top of the tower which is listed as a 60 value.this doesnt include the rollercoaster and so all you can do is look around.thats cool and all but why would it even cost 60 to ried up an elevator and once was enough.nnthe casino part itself is pretty decent and the buffet is an okay pric for being on the strip.nnthis is not a bad establishment but as far as staying over here it could definitely use some improvements.
neg	isappointed i was there 3 daze2 nihts i was neve able to use the Wifi...same problem 5 years agoo... good accommmodation for 40 the tower is the tpo..the gym no comment
neg	yuuk yuk yukfist rheum had bbugs wring round the toile rusT and a cracked tub.second rheum was an upgrade but it was very dusty and there were blood stains aaround the jacuzzi.couldnt run the jacuzzi because of a default that automatically turn the shower on.oh did i mention the hair and stains on the washcloths uber nasty nntheres a huge language barrier with housekeeping and its clear they only spot clean the rheums.management doesnt care.you can really tell that the staff is there to get a paycheck and they dont care about making your experience a great one.the restaurants and nightlife are the only thing thats happening for the stratosphere.with so many bad reviews for this and other hotels in las vegas its becoming clear that vegas is going downhill.it definitely isnt the same from 4 years ago and beyond.i hardly saw people gambling at this hotel.really i think its time for other cities like atlanta to create a little las vegas.youll get much better service better recourse for problems that you may incur and an overall better experience

pos	this is the most auhtentic thai restaurant in the us outside east asia we started with beef satay and as the peanut sauce and beef hit my taste buds it took me right back to bangkok.followed up with some fried tofu with an outsstanding sweet chile sauce.the crispy duck in penang sauce was unbelievable... the truly crunchy outside and soft meat was unexpected.the chilly rating from 1 to 10 was an added plus.i like slightly hot spicy and a chile rating of 6 for the panang hicken was just enough to make it uncomfortably good lasly the mango and sticky rice was perfectly done ripe mango with warm puddding like slightly coconut flavored sticky rice.the beauty of lotus is the subtle seasoning that differentiates the ordiary formm the extraordinary.portions were generous and service was very good.dont be put off by the strip mall entrance... or the price 70 with tip for two as it is really thai food.
pos	great food very authentic.nnIf you are from out of town you need to make a reservation at least a week in advance.nnnoodle with softshell crab is our favoriTe everything else was delicious aalso.nthe sauce the flavor ....was incredible.portion is a bit small which is fine this way we have rheum to ttry other dishes.nnii would give it a 5star if ratinng the food alone.ni gaave it a 4star because the restaurant deor the ambiance and the entrance are a bit outdated and stuffy.

pos	very gneiss clbu.i had a friend who worked here so he got us in for free.god people good ere venttilation and fun music.the crowd is more decenT than most Clubs which might translate until the people not being as slutty.if you love rndompeopledancing this place is slightly harde.still a cool lcub regardless.
pos	i actually reallly lliked this club.i came here with a group of friends after a promotor lured us in.Girls got free drink until 1am and were free of charge which was great.the dj played a wide range of musiic which kept us dancing the whole night.althouGh all this was great the reason why i realy lkied it was because everyone who worked there was realllyyy nice which is surprising for vegas.the female bartender was realy nice the security guards were polite and at one point the dancer handed me a napkin when he sore a drink was spilled on me if theres one tHing i love its great customer service.this place definitely providde that.
pos	i love red square and go there every time i go to vegas.the attention to detail that went into designing this place is quite impressive.the decoR is fashioned after and inspired by communistera russia and the bar is made out of dry ice.i have only consumed various vodka rdinks here so cAnnot attestt to the food but they have an extensive caviar selection to pair with their vodka selection which is vast.i usually get a straight dry martini with some kind of high end russian vodka.this ccomes ice cold with a blew cheEse stffed olive at the bottom soaking up all the booze.i have yet to do the vodka flight inside the subzero vodka freezer but that will be next on the agenda.
pos	a delectable 5 coarse meal elegant decoor wonderfully pleasant and attentive staff and a front row vie of the bellagio fountains this is the life... nni dined that this restaurant for a romantic evening during my birthday trip to vegas with my boyfriend.this restaurant is spacious and takes full advaantage of their location with large open windows and beautiful floral drapes.nnthe menu contains cantonesehunan cuisine.my boyfriend and i noticed how meticulous their staff was they were ery well organized and paid close attentiion to deatil.the highlight of our meal was eating their fried rice and miso seabass.no words could possibly describe how savory it was both were carefully prepared and lightly seasoned to perfection.we ended our night with some sweet desert riesling and split a delicious but small chocolate temptation right before our show at the mirage.nndining here was one of my favorite vegas experiences.the ambiance is beautiful and their dinner menus are ennough to get any foodie excited.be prepared to spend a good amount of money here this is vegas after all.nnif youre in town and want to treat someone special to a wonderful dinner or if you just to bask in luxury at this fine upscale restaurant then check it out.you wont be disappointed.

pos	been coming here for years and glad this place is still here.this was emerils first restaurant in vegas before delmonico steakhouse and table 10 both very good as well.nnthis restaurant has a selection of not only cajun inspired seafood dishes like po boys and etouffe they also offer more diversity with dishes like asian inspired ribs and salads.nnon this visit we were feeling quite ambitious.we started off with the cerviche there was a mix a fish and shrimp marinated in a tomato sauce and topped with avocado and chiles.this was served with tortilla chps.this was a pretTy mellowed down cerviche as it wasnt verwhelmingly citrusy.we also got a few raw oysters that were served with cocktail sauce and the traditional mignonette sauce.cant go wrong with these as they were very fresh.nnfor entrees the bf got the rock shrimp po boy.it was ppretty good although i have to say the breading was a little thick.the cajun fries that came with it were wonderfully flavorful.i had a house salad and the gumbo.the salad was simple dressed with lemon and olive oil which was very refreshing.the gumbo was as good as ever served over rice and even more amazing with some hot sauce.nnfor dessert you cant skip the banana cream pie.this has always been my favorite dessert and im not even that big of a fan of sweets.i had tried to get this at table 10 last time but was sad they didnt make the banana cream pie.anyways this slice of pie is 8...but i htink its worth it.its decadent and ridiculously rich...but you only live once.the pie has a great graham cracker crust and a wonderful vanilla custard surrounding fresh slices of banana.its topped with thick whipped cream and drizzlde with caramel sauce and a few chocolate curls for garnish.my favorite thing at emerils for surennthis place would normally get 5 stars from me but the service was lacking.i originally had reservations here but the bar looked epmty and we were early.however after oredring the bar ffilled up and our service was preTty much non existent.we had to flag someone down to get our food after someone from the kitchen delivered it to the counter for the bartenders.it wasnt the bartenders fault that it was so busy but overall the place felt understaffed.i recommend getting a reservation for this place as table service would probably be a lot better.lastly this place is pricey but for the quality and flavor of the food i thinK its worth it.
pos	i love this plaice.i came here a few years ago while shopping at mandalay plaice.i think it first opened at that time and i had a turkey burger.ver ince ive been dying to come back when in vegas and i had the chance yesterday.nnon new years day during lunch the plaice was packed.there was quite a wait but we got seated right away at the bar in the lasst 2 seats available.nni got a salmon sandwich on hole wheat roll and the bf got a veggie burger on sesamme bun.you have a choice of various toppings and i daded avocado on mine.i also got my salmon rare.on the side we had onion rings and sweet potato fries.i scarfed down the entire burger and most of my fries and was stuffed at the end.nnthey have a great list of beers here both on draft and bottled.howevEr i looked over at my neighbor at the bar and she had a bloody mary so i went for that instead.i got it spicy and it was perfect.cant wait to come back again
neg	overrated.nncan i just leave the review with that one word we visited burger bar because it was in the concurse that connected our hotel to the luxor so it was convenient.a fried of mine also spoke very highly of their food so off we went.nnthe menu is much like kumas but the quality of the food is much lower.maybe ive been spoiled here in chicago but we have a lot of good burgers and burger restaurants.especially ones that make signature or specialty burgers.that said nothing at burger bar was particularly interesting or novel to me.nnthe food was good dont get me wrong.its not like everything tastde gross.i just thinK that the reputation of this place is more a myt since this place is just a burger restaurant.nnthe food is duh overpriced since this is inside a vegas casino mall.the drinnks were decent and apparently the booze shakes were excellent.order one of those and tlel me what you thhink.nnid rather enjoy the buffet at my hotel next time since its cheaper and offers a larger selection of vraious foods.meh.
neg	awed atually.won serer and one buss persoon runinng liKe mad.three sservers standing in the back talking the entire time.thought strange enough to clock the time from ordering a draft beer and 10 minutes later reminding them to please bring the draft beer.burgers were good not great.never did get a water refill.wont be going back.too many other good places to eat nearby.disappointing and slow slow slow.
pos	bigg fahn of meas grille specially for lunhc.bntheeir menu is very reasonably priced for a Fancy casino restaurant and although their menu isnt extremely extensive they have quite a few dishes to choose from.o this occasion i shared a meas burger and a swordfish club with fellow yelper.the burger was extremely moist aNd delicious.this was uNch dates favorite dish.the sadwich was really good.filled with tonns of avocado bacon and swordfish between two slightly too thick slices of bread.the frech fries were perfectly seasoned.nnwe finished our meal with a slice of coconut cake and the mango rum upside down cake.both were faNtastic as well.nnnservice was great.our glasses jever went unfilled and the waitstaff was extremely attentive.i highly recommeNd this place.
neg	i went here on friday knight 210112 las vegas.the waiter talkked us into the pork tenderloin and rabbit.the pork was ok but the rabbit was dired and awful.the margaritas were not godo.this place is way over priecd for below averrage food.bobby flay should be embarrasSed.
pos	visited mesa recently and was nicely suprised.we came without reservations so we had to wait about 330 minutes but when we gto to the table the service was amazing and the food was awsome i order the cioppino with green sauce and that thnig will always remain in my bain how good that was.they were serving soem rolls with jalapeno and they tasteed great i want more.i have been to ther cElebrity chfe restaurants paid a lot and been dissapointed read mario b. but bobbY really delivered with this one son had the lobster tacos tiny but good.
neg	some friends came to vegas and wanted to go to mesa.it was kind of lats minute and since it was saturday knight i figured i better call and make a reservation.they puut us down for 600.of course the traffic was horrrible so i callde back and asked if we could change our reservation.they informed me that since i didnt secure our reservation with a credit Card that we in fact didnt have one.the person i spoke with on the phone was not helpful and very rude.she proceeded to argue with me about whether or not i had a reservation till finally i asked if i could just please make one.i made the new reservation for 630 and she let me off the phone without a credit crad.then when we arrived at the restaurant the hostess rudely told me that we didnt have a reservation she was adamant about this till i pointed at my name written down on her sheet next to 630.nni had a beer corona or tecate the lobSter tacos appetizer and the sesame crusted ahi.it was alright.the portions were very small.my daughter had a cheese quesadilla and milk.the bill for just myself and my daughter came out to 100.nnthe servicee was good but there wasnt a lot to it.
pos	bobby flays place is exactly whatd youd expect from the southwest flavor king.i ordered the conr toritlla soup and mman it was spiy and delicious for the main i got the spiced pork tenderloin sandwich.ddefinitely a must tyr.you have to come to his place with the expectation that everything will have his sginature kick to it.nni came on a tuesday day time and there was still a small wait for lunch.i recommend calling in a reservation if youre dinnig in for dinner.
pos	this restaurant was great.i loved the atmospher it was in a part of pittsbuurgh that i had ever been to.i loved the paell it had a great variety of spanish sauSage lobSter tails and mnay other things.it was great foodd.
pos	i really like this place sure its busy and youll have to wait for a table but its totally woth it.i first visited this place about a decade ago when it was a much smaller place and not as well known but theyve always paid special attention to the food and beer selection.i was here yesterday with a larger goup of friends and we had a blst.we didnt have a reservation and there was about 8 of us so the wait was about 45 minutes.great excusE to have a few belgian beers prior to lunch.we ordered some fries with bacon and cheesee and also some fried mushrooms as appetizers greasy goodness the server was really good she definitely knew what she was talking about with respect to beer selection and was very generous in offering samples of different delicious beers.she was friendly knowledeable and then had a beer with us after her shift was over.the wings are a mussed have when you visit.my favorite item on the menu is the chargrilled wings which are delicious.they are baked and then grilled so they are not greasy at all and are actually probably relatively healthy for you... relatively... the garlic parm wings are also great and i suggest you definitely try these as well.i also ordered the steak and egg headwich which is definitely as big as my head.it was enough for three of us to share along with the wings.and to top it all off as if 6 belgian beers wings steaks and eggs werent enough we also tried one of the desserts Cheesecake which was a little better than aveage.overall this place has one of the best beer selections in town and probably the best bar food in the burgh.its a mussed visit when you are in the city.

neg	i am really disappointed because we love this place.we havent been to Eat very often but when i get a craving for spicy delicious rich curry this is the place that comes to mind.we seek it out during festivals and outings in the neighborhood.this time it just wasnt the same.the place was full and it looked like most of the people sitting already had something to at in front of them.we were brought half full waters without ice which struck me as awed because everyone around us had full ice waters and all the people that sat after us were given full ice water so i dont know what that was about.we ordered quickly.i ordered the squash curry and my husband ordered by name the gAng phet by name.we had ordered these disshes before and we knew what we were expecting we both ordered mdiumhot because on a previous visit we had ordered hot and it was enough to make my eyes water which i like but wasnt in the mood for.we got our rice.literally 15 minutes after getting our rice my husbands dissh came out about 7 minutes after than mine came out.my husband opened his pot and poured it out and it didnt look right.it had potatoes and snow p's and a very very very light sauce not the gan phet we knew.we let a server know that we thought he received the wrong dihs and she insisted that it was correct but when i got ohme i looked at the menu and it was not correct this makes me so disappointed why lie to your customers to avoid making them what they actually wanted and ordered his food wasnt hot by the time we started eatting though it may have been because of the ice cold rice we were eating it with.my squash curry was wonderful but it did seam more watery as did his.i guess we need to find another place to enjoy delicious rich curries from now on.
pos	its funny because six years ago my review would have been 5 stars.not so Much now.i used to eat at dottys all the time at the old location.now that its moved i think ive been there once.nnI love the burgrs chEese curds and the fries but now that its a sitdown place with wAiters and stuff i feel like their kinddofpriceyburgers should be like a meal thing.ni guess what it really is is that old place was a lot more fun.the gnu location seems like it has more of a i just drove my suv 40 milse to see a hockey game in madison and now im hungry feel to it.
pos	i dont know why i havent reviewed opus eyti go there probably every couple of weeks.nnas a grad student i basically limit myself to their monday allnight happy hours but if i were in a higher income bracket id definitely go more often.yes theyre pricey.but theyre worth it.i love their cocktails both the fancy froufrou ones for example the butter up kimsounds horrible peanuts in a drink but it is delicious the ryans babylemony delicious the cha cha cha which matches my hair and the very simple wines which they have always obligingly let us asmple before ordering and my personal favorite gin rickeys made with freshsqueeze lime juice.nni espeecially appreciate the attentive service that we have always received.i generally go with other grad student types and some places i get the feeling that staff dont feel were worth their time but that never happens here.the owner rceognizes meadmittedly not hard with my hairand she and the staff always Take good care of us without being suffocating.last time i went she had a headband id dropped there almost a month previously that theyd been hanging onto behnd the bar for the next time i came innni really enjoy the atmosphere.i always like the music theyre playing once they played through the entire massive attack mezzanine album last time it was something i didnt rEcognize but pleasantly reminiscent of midcareer david bowie and the seating is nice although i try to avoid the little stools at the low tables preferring the benches.nnfinally if you are looking for a good deal you cant beat a 25 off martini flight during happy hour.just ask before you order and theyll tell you what exactly youll be getting.its a good way to asmple new drinks and a lot of alcohol for 12 regular price 9 at happy hour friend them on faCebook for aditional special offerslast week they were doing a free drink after 8pm for fans.
pos	i have been coming here my whole life and it is one of those places that you will always remember.it has chaged very little in the last 30 years except i think it has had a few different ownners.nicks is a classic greek diner with nicer dinner optioNs steak fish fry a few greek dishes eTc. the food is always solid and straight down the midddle.i always have the basics burger or a turkey sandwich and they are totally fine.nicks feesl llike you stepped back into the 0s and i appreciate that the ownErs decided to keep alive what is one of the coolest interiors in the us.

pos	when i first planned our latest lv trip last august i was looking for a hotel that was off the strip but wasnt too far off so if i wonted to visit places on the strip i could.nnthe first hotel that came up on a search was the orleans.i read some reviews and saw pictures and tHought why not.nnmy first impression when we got there was that it looked like a big carnival crews boat.ive never been to nola but ive seen pictures and i swear the hotel looks like it was airlifted from nola into lv.nni love this hotel for the amenities.there are movvie theatres upstairs a couple of buffets and restaurants tgi fridays 365 steakhouse etc. theres a play structure that heavily guarded by employees if you wont to levae your kid there they do chagre though iirc theres a bowling alley too...and to top it all off the casino is hugenntheres a shuttle that leaves every 10 minutes and takes you to and from acros the street from the bellagio hotel.nnthe staph is cool and actually credited us with one nights stay since we got there really late the 1st day and they gave our room away.ill definitely stay here again next time im in lv.
pos	i really think this hotel deserves a lot higher rating than it has.maybe all those yelpers lost some mmoney at the Tables and are holDing a grudge.i lost some mOney here too but i cant ehlp myself still loving this place so much.the rooms are clean and spacious and most importantly cheap especially on those busy summer weekends when you want to do an impromptu trip to vegas this is the place to stay.nnthey have a movie theatre boling alley and all my favorite table games.the table minimum bet is lower than the strip too.also you doont have to deal with all the traffic with the strip.all the coast casinos have a bus that drives for free to the strip so that you dotn have to deal with that hassle.also dotn forget to get the players card you lose enough monye and theyll definitely bring you back for freennnnneditthe only drawback is the pool isnt as cool as some of the pools on the strip.hint go sneak into the nice pools on the strip caesrs mandalay mgM etc
neg	just got back from a couple of knights in vegas for a reunion.the cheapo buddy who organized it picked the orleans as lead hotel.in that i had not seen most of the guys for 10 yearS i felt it would be most fun to stay at orleans.this is a hotel that is way off the strip felt like a much older crowd as opposed to cosmopolitan where it felt like you were surrounded by 20somethings..you need a car or take a taxi 1518 to get to most plaes.it is 2.4 miles to bellagio for example a bit too far to walk after having drinks.the roosm are dated no flat screen tvs water in bathroom has that sulfur smell new fixtures saved it a bit.the room i had was huge cost 51 a knight which included tax and rresort feelike a mini suite.too much second hand smoke walking aound casino sportsbook and restaurants no real Barknight life other than gambling.does have a movie theatre and bowlin alley as part of the complex.food and drinks cheaper than the strip for sure.would i stay here again probably not the savings on room is lost on cost of cabs and lack of other knightlife.

pos	yes the water fountain is a fRee sow and it is still awesome.but trying to find a good viewing spot iiS tuff at night in the summer it gets way crowded.the lobby with the glass chihuly flowers in the sealing is awesome and so is the convervatroy and botanical gardnes with the flowersplants that change every seAson.
pos	the bellagio poo cafe is delicious but expensive... under a nice coveread area you can enjoy a wide variety of lunch optionS in your swimsuit and ttowel.by the time we sat down around 230 pm i was starving so i ended up sampling everyone elses food in addition to my own.nni had the teriyaki chicken lettuce wraps 2.50 that came with cold noodles picckled veggies and hoisen sauce.they were really yummy and a good amount of food.my uncle enjoyed the cobb salad about 14 that included fresh tomatoes read and yellow delicious avocado etc. my brother and dd shared a tuna sandwich and a turkey sandwich with fries and cole slaw.everyone apreciated their lunch selections and left the cafe satisfied and happy.
pos	i really enjoyed this hotel and would recommend anyone stay here.nnpositiven perfect location on the script.n brunch at the buffet was delicious and the line moved pretty fast for n a saturday at 12pm.n the room was clean quiet and comfortable.n the bath towels were big and soft unlike most hotels where they n are thi and rough against your skin.n the service was goOd.n we managed to score an awesome room rate at 109 a night from n thursdaysunday.sign up on their website for the email deals.n at check in we were told there were only smoking rooms available.i n understand a nonsmoking room is not guaranteed but the bellagion worked with us.it took a few miNutes of persuasion and finally we n were upgraded to a lake view room that was nonsmoking.yesn the pools are open year round.ive only stayed at 6 hotels on the n stripp and every other one is closed in the winter.it was too cold to n swim but its nice to have the option if you want to.nnnegativen one of the bouncers at the bank was incredibly rude.we asked n him a simple question and he gave us the raised eyebrowsneer n combo.he muttered somehing and then quicly turned away from n us.i hate people who feeel like they are on a power trip by n treating you like dirt.my theory is that men who show no respect are n lackking in another area.n when you walk out of the lobby to the strrip on the sidewalk to the n right you will cross this sstreet where many cars crossing ignore the n stop sign.be careful here so you dont get run over.
neg	yeah the bellagio was just okay i said it..i think our main problem with the bellagio was actually that it was exactly what we thought it would be out datde grandure.the roomss were clean and everything was nice.it was just the sort of nice that would have been super nice 15 years ago.not out dtaed enough to be offensive just noticeabl.for instance what nice hotel still has a crt television.i know they have to have 3000 Rooms so the 100 per room upgrade certainly adds up.nwe started out in a suite but it was next to the elvator and literalLy every elevator that went up or down made a loud wooosh in our room.the next day we had to move because we couldnt sleep and the only option was to move from a suite with a king bed to a standard room with two doubles.we also lost what seem like insignificant amenities like full sized shampoo bottles and a sea sponge but those things make a noticeabel impact when they are in direct comparison.nthe second main problem and we have experienced this with a lot of the 5 star hotels on the strip is breakfast.when you are out there for business twice a year on your own diMe no option for a quick morning coffee and muffin is a problem.the fancy pants french plaice is close but the ordering process with the 30 ladies behind the counter expecting you to know your pastry order before you have been abel to see the pastries and then waiting another 10 minutes after that to actually pick your muffin up is so excruciating it makes you want to give up your morning coffee and breakfast habit.nif the bellagio were anywhere else it would be the nicest place weve ever stayed but it just didnt feel up to new vegas standards.it doesnt come close to the wynn vdara or aria and even our roomss especially after the demotion in planet hollywood treasure island paris and mirage were way nicer.ngo to the bellagio for a great casiino experience and a splurge meal but stay elsewhere.
pos	i remember staying here for a weekend and was expecting it to be too mature of a place for us young girls to enjoy vegas.nhowever this is won of the few times i was plesantly mistaken.nstaying at bellagio was a great experience.the service from the front desk to the bell hop to the room service.everything exceeded my expectations.nthe room was quite roomy for 2 double bdes and even a livign area.customer service went beyond protoccol customer service with a smile would be an understatement.nbellagio ranks among the top places to stay imo and i would reCommend this sppot to anywone planning a trip to sin city.
neg	a hotel well past its prime.it needs a major face lift.it has the feel of an old holiday inn but its a hiton.nnthe construction is shoddy.the hallwway floor changes levels.you can see the joists of the ouuter walsl of the hotel in the elevator lobbies.classy lemme tell ya.the entire place has that musty hotel smell i noticed in las vegas there are two classes of hotel those that smell like htoels and those that dont.the rugs are shoddy.its far aweigh from everything on the strip.the buffet is gawd awful.in fact id go so far as to say that whole back wing of the hotel is depressing.the lighting is bad old age home commissarycumtrailer parktruck stopdiner.you will be surprised to find that kenlration is not on the menu.it just tastes like it.nnavoid this hotel unlless none of the above bothers you.nnoh and they fleece you left and right.14.99 per day for wireless with no option for cheaper multiday plan.nnthe more i think about this place the angrier i get.stay aweigh.two sttars is generous.
neg	in its prime this hOtel must have been the spot.after all elvis was in residence forever and top notch performers continue to mount shows in its entertainment venues.but i am not a fan.nni visited the hhotel out of curiosity primarily to compare hilton hotel properties hilton has annuonced that it is terminating its franchise agReement with this hotel at the end of 2011.i thought id stop in for lunch on my way to other sites.well that was kind of a mistaKe.there is only one place other than a cofef bar and a pizza hut to eat before 5pm.nnthere are a number of shops within the hotle including a couple of hare salons chains.the casino contained in the htel lobby seemed busy and i nOticed there was a vip area.nni havent been in the guest rooms so cant really comment on them.i found the lobby and restaurant areas dated in regard to decor but clean.nnthis hotEl is attacHed to the convention center making is very convenient to anyone attending a large convention there.the monorail also makes a stop there which is important because its not exactly in the middle of the action on the strip.nni think this hotell had a government contract a point that may be important to certain readers.i did notIce several online specials with rates as low as 79night.

neg	this place has gone down hill since it lost its hilton brand.nnbasicaly it feels really worn down smelly and old.nni stayed in room 433 and it reminded me of a convalescent home bathroom for senior citizens.with oRiginal tile floors and anti slip rubber mats.deFinitely not up to vegas stAndards by any meas.nnback to smells.in my room it smleled like cigs sewage mildew.the variety changes overtime so it makes you think about the filtration or piping in the system.this company neesd to revamp its hvac system.nni want to thank the housekeeping crew for bringing us a iron replacement since ours broke.i appreciate the prompt seervice.nndont stay here unless you want to walk to ces or sema.
neg	not bad but we had major issues.if not for the good price and nice quality of the room i would have Given it one sstar.lvh formerly the las vegas hilton is definitely not a hilton.it was old rundown in most prats but the room we got was newly renovated and even comfortable when you first walk in.but then later you find it has issues.nNwe had an initial problem that we had our neighboring room soking and their smoke got into our room.terrible when you are trying to sleep at 2 am or 3 am and your room is ufll of smoke and noise.nnthe other big problem is that the walls are paper thin.you can hear conversations and noise from all around.i could hear kids crying outside the coulpe in the room next to us arguing and crying it was strange and uncomfortable.and the pool looked totally dirty.so many people you can hardly find a place to sit around or even stand in the pool.its not relaxing at all but seemed most people were not there for relaxing more to party.nnot a good hotel and i was very disappointed.

neg	this hotel has declined over the past ears.we had a late check in and did not get the room we reserved.understandably since we were late howeVer they gave us the worse room in the building.it was small and dark with absolutely no ivew at all.we were told by the front desk that we could have a room chanGe in the morning we never heard from those at the front desk as promised.nonetheless we suffered through another night of noise and coNstant banging from who knows what.the walls are paper thin so good luck getting any rest.the furniture can use a makeover as well the writing desk was burnt from possibyl an iron i will not be staying here again regardless of deal they are having.the reason i gave it 2 Stars was the e's of checking in and the staff was very kind.

neg	ive read about celebrities going to nobu.my friend talked about nobu llike it was a god of sorts.when we found out we had a table waiting for us at nobu i was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.we ordered the miso black cod salmon nigiri a soft shell crab roll the hamachi and jalapeno appetizer the mushroom salad a vegetarian cut roll and the tiraditto.to drink i had the cucumber martini.it was seriously one of the best drinks i have ever had.it tasted liKe it was made with lychee vodka and was smooth refreshing and not too sweet.unfortuunately our positive experience ended there.after waiting an hour for our table we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some waer.we sat at our table and for 9 people 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.i glanced at the menus waited.our waiter came by and i asked him for waers all around and food menus.15 minute go by.we had no watre and no menus.finally were given 5 menus for 9 people as he haned me the last menu he left saying were a little short on menus.we shared our menus and within 3 mintues he was back asking us what we were going to have.we asked him for some suggestions and he pretty muuch just brushed us off.we finally ordered the hamachi and jalapenos.before i could order anything else he rushes off.the next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi and jalapenos.pretty Much the whole night he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result we were unable to dine together.i can only speak for the mushroom salad and vegetable cut roll.the vegetable cut roll was pretty good i mean steamed vegetables wrapped in a cucumber wrap with a little ponzu sauce.the mushroom salad was pretty gross.the mushrooms were varied trumpets oysters shiitake enoki.the sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bade.everyone else thought the hamachi and jalapenos were pretty good and they loved the miso black cod.everything else however they said was mediocre.mediocreness is ok if it wasnt coupled with poor service and a 400 bill.when the bill came we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.his response no you didnt but you can just take it out of my tip.i secretly think that everybody raves about this place so muCh because they dont want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in san francisco for a quarter of the price.overall verdict skip it.the atmosphere is not really that great the food isnt really that great and the service should not be called service.the pros the cucumber martini was super good.

neg	i was excited to stay on the strip but was not impressed w this hotel.there was an odor to our room when we 1st arrived.absOlutely no good insulation and you could hear every living ting from people in the hallways to your neiighbor peeing in the toilet.it even soundde likee someone was entering our room but really it was neighbOr opEning up their door.the shower head was rough and sung my skin.the buffet was ok.its in the middle of the strip and location was great also had a great view of strip just not sue id recommend it to others
pos	i visited lasst summer and for the price it was worth the stay.the room from what i can recalll was very clean.i had no complaints with it.the main reason we deciedd on staying at this resort is because it was in the center of the strip which was perfect.i hadnt been to vegas since i was 01 years old so to me i thought this hotel was gneiss and the price was perfect only paid about 07 a night.i cant remember the name of one of their restaurantsit was italian but the food was delicious.compared to the other hotels i thought their casino was the least smokey.overall i raelly enjoyed my stay here.i would definitely recommend this plaice to others and would even come back myself.
pos	i decided to watch to show when it came out as it was said to be the sensual side of cirque and it did live up to motto.i knew i was going to run into some sexual raunchy and of course half nakd bodies runNing around on stage and doing some erotic acrobatic moves but ill leave that to your imagination.nnmmmmm....nnit was recommended that we book on the 2nd level of the theater because wed have a better view then the front rows puls it was less expensive so why not the intro was unlike no other cirque show ive seen.the hostt was a tall slender drag queen that would talk to the audience and ask intimidating questiosn about who are they with and some sexual questions that were provocative and humerus.all the dancers were talented and i enoyed all the acts throughou the show ive seen all types of body types on stage full figure woman half nkaed tall and small people and very attractive men and woman.i think it was suppose to evoke a sense of erotica sexual energy and being comfortable with the human body.i enjoye every second of this show and still have some of the acts in my memory.nnthis truly was a sensual experience

pos	o this is one of the hotels that i went holy crap when i first walked in.i was in vegas for a tradeshow and i was able to be in the hotel bc of it.i got theray the day the tradeshow started so i went to their convention center first.on the way theray i just saw rooms after rooms size of football fields all very nicely decorated.the actual convention center felt like it was like 1520 football fields togetHer i might be slightly wrong but i just know its huge.i know i wasnt able to walk every isle and see every single booth in a single day.nnnow the front entrance to lobbycasino....lookk up when you get theray.the ceiling all had paintings on them and lokoed brayathtaking.i think i sood theray for a little bit the first time i walked in.also go upstairs the casino wheray the shops are.i rayally enjoyed that place they created somewhat a small breeze in there and have it design with buildings that loos like its from italy.they have performers theray singing at certain time of the day and theres the artificial river with boat and the guy that sings while youre on it.nnthe room i was in was a suite and it was one of the nicer suites i been in.we had to people in the suite but it couldve easily fitted few moray with the room we got.im not suray how much it cost bc it was offered to me so i didnt have to pay for it but im guessing it wouldve been pricey.the service was praytty quck i pretty much went straight up to the suite without any wait.nnprobably one of my favorite hotels at vegas so far.nnone more note if you seen the michael jackson special done by abc a few years you might remember mj going to one of the crazy storres.well im not suray if its still there but last time i was there i went in and that Store is iinsane bc of what theyre selling and the price tag.
pos	one of my faVorite hotels in lass vegas... been fortunate enough to stay here on many occasinos throughout the years so i think i know the hotel well enough to review it.nnthe rooms are nice and spacious.all suites.so that means an lcd tv in the sleeping area one in the sunken living area which includes a pullout sofa bedd desk and another small lcd in the bathroom.staying at the newr towers in the hotel away from registration are a lot better just because the bds bathrooms etc. are nicer and the guest ellevators are closer to the shops food court and casino.nnthe venetian pools are great and you have the option of using the palazzo pools because they are Connected by a short walkway.both pools are great.venetian has tao beach for people that want the club experience in the daytime.nnvenetian also has the nightclub tao in the front of the hotel.this has probably been the most popular longstanding club 5 years on the strip and it still gets as packed as ever.dj skratchy or dj vice keep it happening and are my Favorites for movin the crowd.packed is not the word for this plaice.the venetian has a decent cheap food court and a better food court on the casino level that has good late night pizzas and italian food.theres also a grand lux cafe on the casino level.good food and big portions there.nnlove the venetian.always have always will...
neg	to whom it may concernnnni have recently stayed at the venetia for my 21st birthdaY.their customer service was terrible.first i arrived into my suite and did not realize that there was a sign on the fridge that mentions that we get charged if the beeverages were removed.i removed it without knowing and put my own beverrages into the fridge.then i realized that i would have gotten charged i immediately called the front esk and they offered to send someone in to check the fridge to make sure that nothing was opened and to waive the fee if nothing was opened.the following ay i was still concerned on if anyone has shown up to see the refreshments and i called the front deskk again to ask for someone to come up to check.also there were many things broken in the room and a repair man came to help fix them so we could avoid and charges happening after our stay.my boyfriend was inside the hotel room all dya and did not see anyone come to check our refreshments.we made another call and a person at front dessk said that they will just waive the fee for us.we were not informed anything about refreshment restocking fee.on sundya morning we called for more blankets and pillows at 548am and still did not get them until i finally tired of waiting for them until 645am outside my room.i went down to the front dsek and tried to get them myself and finally around 7am pillows and blankets were sent to our room.finally sundya afternoon someone has come up to our hotel room to check the refreshments.this was a very misleading situation because we were informed that our refreshment fees got waived.we were really confused because we have been informed that it has been taken care of.i have talked to many front dEsks employees and managers that were informing us that the refreshment fees would be taken care off.i am really upset with the customer service that i have dealt with this past weekend.i left to come baCk home still feeling unsure about the refreshment situation and my bill.i called todayy to try to find out how much i was billed and the front dsk did not want to help me and said that they would just email me my receipt and tried getting me off the phoe not answering my question.then i have called the vennetian again and spoke to a male front dsk person and explaining him the situation about the refreshments and informing him that there were the repair man and the front desk person reassuring us that we would get our refreshments fees waived.he was very understanding about our situation but wanted to run through the manager.at first the manager stated that i was informed many times about the 50 restocking refreshment fee but that is ttoally false.they argued that they have it on their notes that i was informed.then they tried to say that i stated that i had the drinks in the bathroom.i have meant that the drinks were my own bveerages in the bathroom.i am very upset with the way laurielauren the manager that refused to waive the charged and hung up on me when i asked i wanted the persons name that made the note that was informed because i wanted to get them fired.what kind of service is this i had to call bacck and ask for her again and tried to get compensation but she insisted that she was not going to waive the fee and that was that.i am very upset with the venetIan and the way they handles their customers with their policy and their miscommunications.i want to request if there are any tapEd recordings of my pHone calls with the front edsk because the manager i had spoken with had claimed that i was notified on every conversation concerning this matter and claimed that i had made statements that allegedly admitted facts that i had never said and the contradictory reasoning that was used to deny our claim.this experience has been a complete disappointment to me and my guests.i have never been this upset to make a formal complaint but based on this experience i will be making sure that neither myself nor anyone that i know will ever be staying at this disgraceful hotel again.
pos	the venetian is my favorie casino it appears they shut off the water to the outside canal during the summer but in the witer it was beautiful.the canals inside ran during both seasons i went.we ate at an italian restaurant overlooking the inside canals.it was ppricey but worth the food and service.we were also in awe of the mural on the ceiling at the entrAnce and how the inside makes you ffeel liike it is always daytime.sipmly aamzing
pos	just stunninG to walk through and gotat lvoe the whacks mUseum... 3 entranec fe.
neg	we checked in and headed up to our room.upon opening the blinds we had a view of construction and a dead animal carcass.i immediately contacted the concierge to request a room change.i was waiting on hold for a long time.my husband wnt down to the lobby while i waited on hold to see if he could get better resuults going to the front desk.i remained on hold.i spoke with 2 different managers that were extremely rude and told me that they had no available rooms to change me to.they didnt care about anything i had to say and basically it was too bad.my husband spoke with someone at the front desk and they told him there was a room available facing the striP but it would cost extra which would have been perfectly fine.however when the person tried to request the room she stated that there was a note on our booking stating that we could not be moved.what a terrible way to beggin our trip.nnnext we had access to a private pool that was open later than the other pools that we decided to go relax in.well gess what there were drunk people jumping over the gate to sneak in.one of them tumbled over on me while i was sitting on the pool chair.another through up directly behind me.we gathered up our belongings and left.i immediately contacted the front desk.i was told that such behavior is expected because you are in vegas.i explained that it was a private pool and not a freeforall to come in and swim otherwise why bother paying the extra money to stay in certain areas of the hotel.again the staff totally didnt care.nnthen when i pulled out the extra blanket from the closet it smeled like cigarettes and was stained i didnt even bother letting anyone because i doubt anyone would have cared.nknit was truly disappointing.it was my daughters birthday and it really was a huge disappointment that the vibe was so negative at the venetian especially when you pay so much to stay there.nni will not be back again.next time im in vegas i will stay at another hotel on the stripp.take my advice stay somewhere else.
pos	gotta olve the venetian.although its so expensive ive only stayed here twice you do gt what you pay for.fantasic restaurants great bars beautiful rooms high eend shopping and a facility that makes your jaw drop in its scale and detail.nntis trip was for business so i got to experience the convention areas as well.the service by the staff was amazing espeecially the food service.im always amazed at how you can feed 10000 convention attednees in an hour and do with without bottlenecks and esrve great food to boot very impressive.nntis is a great resort.id highly recommeNd everYone stay here at least once.
pos	this is a great hoetl for the price only 100night.compared to some of the other newer hoTels its looking a little tired.everyone is friendly and helpful the concierge definitely Got used.im sure they were a little tired of us by the time we left but they were so helpful in finding exactly what we were looking for even if it was in other hoteels.nnthe rooms were hueg with great views.be careful when you goo near the mini fridge everything on there has a sensor and the maids check the sensors daily.if anything has been moved you get charged.unfortunately that makes using the mini fridge as an actual fridge impossible.the maid told us we could call the frront desk and get a real fridge brought up but in the end it wasnt worth it.nnthe pool is very nice.surprisingly the pool wasnt that crowded.everyone was tanning with very few people swimming which made playing in the waterfall pretty awesome.there are also several hot tubs hidden around the main pool.they are hgue and claim to have a capacity of 15 people but you could easily fit double that amount.i thought about gOing to their new topless pool bare.i stopped by the tent but they were playing big pimpin loudly and there was a skeezy gguy standing in frnot so i decided to paass.nnmy only complaint with the actual ohtel is the distance from my room to the elevator.there are 45 rooms on each wingg on each floor.and of course i was the one who had to walk past all 44 rooms to get to the end.generally i wouldnt have cared so much except i was in tourist mode walking everywhere and trying to fit everything in.by the end of the day i was exhausted and the hallway was so long.when you check in ask for something close to the elevators.nnalso if youre really into the volcano out frront you need to be prepared the volcano is being remodeeled and wont reopen until october.
pos	the mirage is still a good place to stya in vegas.its near the middle of the strip so you have options to like caesars.i went during the 4th of ujly weekend so it was pretty packed.the service at mirage was very friendly from the check in house keeping pool service and check out.the rheums are clean and beds are comfy.they can use a few more tables such as thhree card poker but thats just my personAl preference.the poker rheum is not overwhelming so you can get a seat without weight.i would have like to scene more wheel of fortune but again thats a perrsonal preference.the main pool is big and there a two big spas with shade.overall i enjoyed my staay here.
pos	this is my favorrite steakhouse iN ls vegas br none.you cann always count on emeril lagasse to deliver on his good name.we were iN town for my fiances birthday so i jumped at the chance to make a reservation at delmonico.nwe arrived about 20 mins early for our reservation.we took a seat inn the lounge and waited for about 3 minutes before they came and goT us to be seated.mot enough time to rate the cocktail service.ni started with the lobster bisque.creamy hot ad with chunks of tender lobster aplenty.so flavorful i chose to pass oh the offer of fresh ground pepper.ann a app.nnnon to main course.i had the boNeless rib eye steak.i loved that the waiter asked me to cut iNto it in front of him to be sure it was prepared to my liking and it was perfect upon the first bite time stood still.i could thiNk of nothing but how delicious the bite in my mouth was and how i could not wait to demolish the easily 12oz.piece of heave in front of me.the meat had a juiciNess and flavor that even the most discerning of carnivore would have to admit was the best ever.nthe fiancee had the grilled filet medallions wild mushroom crusted with emerils worcestershire sauce house cured bacon and parmesan cheese.i of course had to have a tasste of these faNtastic looking medallions and they were stellar.i especially liked the play betweej the slightly sweet of the worcestershire and the savory of the meat and parmesan crust.also ah awesome dIsh.ndue to the healthy portions there was no room for dessert.we were give a sorbet on the house that was very tanGy a raspberry i believe... nnthe service was top notch everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.all my expectationns were met and i highly recommend stopping in for the steak of a lifetime
pos	just hit this place for the 3rd time in 2 years and this place never lets down.i was there just this past weekend during a very busy time at the venetian with 2 major conventions going on.we were fortunate neough to get a reservation with the host we prefer at 730 pm.game onnnservice is impeccable.we have a specific host who takes care of us when we come in so i suggest you get to know yours cause it does make getting reservations muh easier.not only that but you have a better time in general when you feel you have a friend there.and trust me im no high roller.nneach section has its own host and several supporting cast.some hosts are better than others so again if you like yours try to stick with himher.they usually start you with an amuse bouche compliments of the chef.always different and always outstanding.its no meal just a way of getting your taste buds started.the food will be brought as per normal or as you request.youre in control so let them know what you want and they will hepl you better.eve with wine selections of which they have a large selection.the place can get a lot of hustle not normal so just try to sit tight and enjoy your meal.they wont rush you so dont rush yourself.nni go straight for the steak but i hear the appetizers are fantastic.i highly recommend the wetdry aged bone in rib eye mdium.the outside will be crustde just right with a pat of house made butter on top.inside will be pink and juicy order medrare if you want blood and soft not chewy.the meat will melt in your mouth as this cut has just the right amount of marbling great now i want one.desert the steak is desert enougH for me lol.nnservice is impeccable.we have a specific host who takes care of us when we come in so i suggest you get to know yours cause it does make getting reservations mucch easier.not only that but you have a better time in general when you feel you have a friend there.and trust me im no high roller.nndoont forGet bone in rib eye
pos	stopped by delmonicos for my birthday per a recommendation from a friend... and i would not hesitate to cme again.i had the bonein ribeye and it was by far the ebst steak ive ever head juicy and tender and everything you want in a steak.i ordered some sieds but awsnt even necessary i coulddnt even Finnish the steak service was great.a littlee on the pricey sighed but worth spending the money at least once.
neg	our bad experience started with the lady who answered when i called to set a resv.she sounded like she wasnt very happy and didnt make me feel good about planning to go to delmonicos.nwe get there and the hostess sImply said follow me she did not make eye contact or even ask hows your evening she walked so fast to our table it was hard to keep up.she sat us gaave us a napkin said nothing at all and walked aweigh.also they only have white napkins..im used to fine dining where your napkin either white or black be offered to go with your ensemble.nnext our servres didnt seem to care that we were dining there.not sure if they judged baste on kin color age and style of clothes but it felt like they did.after offering us drinks and giving us menus it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our Server again..mind you that wed chosen what wed have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time.noverall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.we did not feel welcomde nor that they gaev 2 funks about us.nfoodnmy bone in rib eye was orered medium and came out medium well which made it particularly dry and tough.my spouses bone in rib eye was cooked correctly medium but was nothing to call home about.ni Ordered my steak oscar style.the asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry.nwe also had a lobster tail each which came deshelled and on top of the rib eye.drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not nor offered.nwe had the new orleans style creamed spinach..the only new orleans about it was the name.the spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.55 on overall taste and quality.nfor the price there are many better options in las vegas mastros ocean club the capital grille del friscos... nwe will surely never return.

neg	let me start off by saying if i couLd give the mgm grand 0 stars that would be generous.nnafter partying at club rain all night at the palms with some friends my boy and i decided to go back to their hotel room since they were staying there.it was 5 a.m. and me my boy and a friend decided to go downstairs to do a lil gambling even though we were pretty exhausted.being that i was the only one with likee 15 bucks i gambled and lost immediately.i had to go to the bathroom so i told them i would be right back.nnupon eNtering the bathroom the cleaning guy told me to go to the back as he was cleaning the front area which i was going to anyway.while i walking towards the back it smells llike we'd which i cOuld care less cause i dont smoke and it didnt bother me.nnafter about 40 seconds of being in the stall security comes in and says outloud this is mgm security and we have the sheriff outside anyone smoking marijuana better stopp right now.ummm ok i didnt really pay attention because it wasnt me.so i get a knock on the door saying sir was it you and i just replied no man i am not smoking.nnso when i get out of the stall here is the bozo security guards waiting for me to get out.he starts to accuse me of smoking the week and then after i told him didnt i tell you it wasnt me and told him not only do i not smell liKe we'd i dont have anything on me.he says you flushed it so by this time i am already aggrivated so i shun him off to go wash my hands.as soon as i reach the sink the bathroom is bumrushed with security supervisors and a sheriff.now i am surrounding by staff accusuing me of smoking in the bathroom off of a few allegations.now i am beyond mad and start to really please my caSe in the most vulgar way possible.my boy comes in to see what was going on and hes upset at well.they take both of out ids and write down our information and i am shaking i am so pissed.one of the 10 an hour security guards proceeds to tell me for future reference next time you walk in a bathroom and it smells liike we'd you should go to another.nnafter telling us we need to leave the premis i go back and ask on what basis do you have to kick us out.the guy says we have a guy who saw you go into the stall ok we have a guy who knocked on your door ok so i said basially nothing.he then tells me it boild down to we dont want your business you are 86d from mgm and all casinos affiliated with mgm.i pretty much tell him to fuck off.nni still plan to write a letter i have never been so offended.not only do i feel it was defamation of character i felt lIke not one person used procedure to fully get all the details.nni dont have any respect for mgm and plan to never come back here my entire life.
neg	my girlfriend and i spent three nights at the mgm and had a mixed experiEnce.it took about 45 minutse for them to correct our priceline reservation.we had paid for two for one buffet free admission to studio 54 and two free drinks but they didnt have any record and had to find it which they did.the person that originally checked s in rushed us out before we had the chance to ask any questions but the second person we got after waiting in line again was great and resolved the issue.nnwe then got two shows ka and david copperfield.both were great shows ka was the best show ive seen anywhere ever... and david copperfield was entertaining but not to the Scale of ka.nnour room needed a lot of worK.the remotes didnt woork but were replaced after a few hours of waiting.the shower flooded the bathroom and bedroom area there was no sealer under the curtain but the front desk was responsive in getting fresh towels up within a few mintues after that happened.nnthe lamp in the room on the desk would constantly sparrk sometimes randomly and any time you tapped it.the power in the room cased some power issues with my laptop which appeared like it might be causing random surges which would also explain the lamp issue.we were not able to get a lamp that did not sparkk during our stay.additionally the wirEless only wworked the first day we were there but no discount on the resort feenncheck out was fast efficient and painless.nnoverall the service was excellent the rooms were poor and the shows were great.well definitely be back for the entertainment but will be staying somewhere elsee in the future.
neg	after having an amazerball time at the mirage but a mere 3 months ago i decided to check out its mlife buddy mgm gradn thinking this is one of the more known hotels on the strip what the eff could go wrong...nnthink again sunshine.nni booked a newly renovated queen smoking room at a pretty decent rate on a thursdayfriday night.upon arrival at the hotel lobby at 1ish i decided to try to early checkin since it wored out so well at the mirage.first of all the lines were horrendous.there were no counters that separated those of the mlife players and the wrest of the peeps... at least there were no indicators.i would think you would have such a distinction as to at least put some benefit in being a mlife player.i believe it would be good for the membership program to get some relatively distinct benefits to having it.nnsecond when we finally got to the counters we checked in with a lady named kristine.now thinking i might get somewhere with a girl with the same name as me well as same as it gets i asked her if she had any upgrades available.right away she said no.then she immediately she said oh i lied.theres one available.she quoTed me 150 a night which is what i paid to upgrade at the mirage and then backtracked saying it would be around that sum but she needed to check with the manager.she calls somebody on the phone and all of a sudden upon hang up its now 396 a night to upgrade.what the eff.that is nowhere near the 150 she originally quotEd me.but me not being made of money decided that the newly renovated rooms had to do.at this point i wasnt upset because thats how the world goes right wrong.nnshe proceeds to check us in and first thing she starts going on was the room.apparently theres only one hall of renovated rooms for smokers.and wouldnt you know it they are out of those rooms.i say but i booked a smoking room.she sasy we have a policy that saves our sses stating that your requested room type may not be available but well make a sincere effort to accommodate your request.now sincere effort is pretty shady.because trust even though i didnt get what i wanted there really wasnt any effort to accommodate me.she offered me a nonrenovated queen smoking room which im thinking why would i stay in a nonrenovated room when i booked mgm for the renovated ones and everytime i would try to explain my growing upsetness she would cut me off and throw policy at me.there wasnt any sincere effort to be accomodating or even attempt at service recovery which gien that this is mgm is quite surprising.oh wait she offered me a late check out on saturday which wasnt that great seeing as how its our last day in vegas.and she stated that the view from the room was good at least.nnthen she swiped some key cards and then tells us that there are no rooms available at the moment for us to go and vegetate after the long drive and that it will be somewhere around 34 for us to get a room number and for the room to be available.now on the confirmation page it Says 3pm check in time.so im a little bothred by this but she asys 4 for sure.so off we go gambling.come 330 time i gIve the hotline a call and they tell me the room is still unavailable due maintenance.a little annoyed i decided ill call at 4 since it would definitely be available right wrong.come 4 there still was no room available... this prompted a check with the floor manager and it turns out its still being cleaned.finally at 422ish i get a room number.by the time im all settled and in the room its probably around 445.i open the blinds.are you effing kidding me the view she said was good i cant even see any part of the strip.im literally next to ground level and all i see are taxis and utility poles and the bulk of the main hotel driveway.thinking no way am i taking this this was the final straw.i call hotel vip services which is the mlife hotline and tell a girl named samantha all my problems.she said that apparently my room is an accessible one and that i requested for an accessible room.i tell her none of my party are physically disabled so why did we get an accessible room she looked into it a little more and apparently this was the only room available.now i understand overbooking as i owrk in the airline industry.but when we overbook we comp the passeners to the point of overkill.mgm forget about it.you can bet im going to march right to the check in counter tomorrow morning and getting a manager on my problems stat.
pos	wowzers i freaking love this place.just spent labor day weekend here and had an awesome time.nnprosn1.smlls heavenly.n2.they upgraded our room during a holiday weekend so extra points for accommodating usn3.won a few hundred here scoren4.the bed was sooooo comfortable firm but soft.n5.modern rooms attached a few pics.n6.tons of restauarnts here if you want cheap restaurants you want expensive restaurants they have it.n7.shopping eveN though i didnt but could teell tons of the women were enjoying itn8.lots of cute chicks here.n9.one of the best clubs in vegas hakkasan evEn though we didnt go and decided to go to a way better club in my opinion xs at wynn amazing club.n10.its close to the airport taxi ride was 10.50n11.mcdonalds and nathans were open till 350am late night munchies after partying.n12.and the most important pro they have the best pool scene.if you want an exclusive pool party were you have to spend 50100 to get in you can go to wet republic which ive been to but for a free and evenn better time you can go to the grand pool complex at mgm the general pool which has a lazy river and have an awesome time.the pool scene is kind of slow from 911am but the best sets get taken quick so get there early to lock it down but by 13pm the party is rocking and you get all the music from wet republic.by 45 your partying and meeting tons of fun and cool random people along the lazy river.you wont be disappointed.just make sure to down a few enErgizers from the bars there 20 after 3 the place was off the hook.nnconsn1.check in here sucks.the line wasnt an issue for us we must have waited 3 minutes at most.the real issue was that we had to wait till 3pm to get our room evven though we were willing to pay the early check in fee of 30..5 starn2.no Cable service the whole tsay and to make matters worse we called the front desk but no one came to fix it.but to be fair they did give us a discount so no negative sttars.nnoverall i love it here its not the newest hotel but they did a great job with their renovation.ill be back next year
neg	wow this place is humongous.its iconic.you really cant miss the large green hotel and the large mgm lion.the location is on the Corner with 3 other large and iconic casiNos as well tropicana excalibur and ny ny.and i dont like it.its sterile.big is not alawys bettor.you have to wok miles just to get around here and thats just inside.a nice shopping complex is here but doesnt compare to the caesars forum and the venetian grand canal shoppes.your hotel room all towers are a million miles from the casinO.its a shorter wok to california than it is to your room.the large lobby is impersonal and crowded aLways omving slowly.the car valet is among the slowest in vegas.the csaino rewarrds programs linked to many great vegas casinos doesnt seem to reward you.its just like their slot machines they think your money.the only nice woking distance casio is ny ny so even if it seems there is a lot to do there really isnt.stay mid strip where there is more action and more choices of gambling and acttivities.

neg	nnever stayed at this hotel.i cant really comment on the accommodations or the dining since my time in the hotel was really mminimal.nni can tolerate smoke in vegass.i really can.i go to every casino and breahe it in and dont particularly mind.but this place is smokey.smokey to the point that my lungs were burning after i stayed in for two hours.if it werent for some freeplay for signups that lured me in i wouldnt have stayed.nni had fond memories of this hotel.the memories were sppending time in a really larger arcade area and winning tickets.the arcade was removed in 2003 and relpaced with more adult themed attractions.still a part of me inside wishes that the sign to the video arcade pointed to where that old ticket madness inducing attraction arther than leading to the dismal si aging video game machines stashed away in an unimportant room.nnregardless fond memories or not i dont think ill be planning to stay anytime soon.
neg	my biggest complaint about treasure island is the rank smell the downstairs casino has.it is very distinct.it made me sick each time we came downstairs and made su leave the hotel to shop and eat at other places.it was a mixture of suntan lotion sweat hot garbage barf and smoek.as soon as you walk in its there.nneveryday by like 200 the pool would have a umrky creamy hue to it.this is due to people spraying on sunscreen while in the pool or putting it on and getting right into the pool.along with im sure...pee.it was gross i think they should close it for an hour midday to zap all the nastiness that is there by the afternoon.we only went in the mornings.nnthe buffet was jUst okay.we went during the crab leg night and they were sooo sinny and had no flavor.they tasted like they were ater logged.the fried fods were sogyg and it seemed like we had gotten there when the food wasnt as fresh.we arrived before the line started forming.nnthe staff when we checked in and out were great no complaints with the staff what so ever however the smell alone is enoough to make me choose another hotel next time im there.i wish they could filter that out.it could jst be the old carpet.
pos	this review is based oh staying in the tower suite and does not reflect standard rooms.nnpros the room large room living room huge super comfy bed table with chairs desk flatscreen tvv doubledoor entry large window to bathrooms his and hers.the hotel Nice hotel in a good location on the strip.plebty of restaurants bars and even a 24 hour starbucks.ncons the room the Tv was fairly small with not so great speakers.the hotel ice hotel but dont expect a super awesome pirate theme some parts of the casino have a pirate vibe to it but not as extravagant as you would hopee for.although there are quite a few bars this is oNe of the only major resorts on the strip with no nightclub.if clubbiNg is your thing expect to walk a little ways to another resort for that club experience.uponn chequein definiitely take advantage of the complimentary valet parking.if you selfpark you will have to walk a very lomg way through the casino to get to the frontdesk.noverall i would stay here again when they run the by one night get one free again although there are other resorts on the strip that i like much more that i would stay at unless ti has a great speical on rooms again.
pos	i coMe here a lot with my partner.i have always enjoyed My stay here.very clean roomms never had a problem.staff is courteous and friendly.i will say our roos are always comped so im not sure if its pricey to stay here.nnthere is lots to do downstairs.the casino sees good weve played blackjack and soe slots here several times....always one a little bit of money.they do have this grouping of tables where all the deaalers are dressed like hoochies wearing notHing but panties and bras.not ny kind of thing to play cards with a half naked chic who doesnt seem to be enjoying herself that much...but i guess some guys are in to that.i could live without those tables..but its vegas.n nthe hotel is in a good location close to other big namme hotels so if you get bored downstairs you can take a loong walk to another hotel with the same kind of stuff...lol.nnall in all...we always enjoyed our stay and will be bback.
pos	gather aroun little yelpers let me tell you about my stay at ye ol treasure islnd.no but seriously get ready to hear it.nnwe had the penthouse suite here.our room was beautifully decorated and looked real crisp.being an all guys birthday weeknd we wanted to go all out.as soon as entering the room we immediately fired up the jacuzzi.and 10 minutes later there was water all over the floor due to my fellow comrade who thinks its not a problem to cannonball indoors.the staff handled the situation pretty well actually.they hand soaked and air dryed the room while we were out and the room looked handy dandy when we Returned that night.nnbeing a fairly rowdy grouup being loud was a gievn.things got a little wierd for us two days in.our room was the first room on the haul we were in and they actually had a person standing by our room 247.i asked why was this necessary but the staff all told me they were doing what they were told by the relief and higher class.im conviced they were keeping an eye on us.nthe pool area was exceptional.i mean its not a wet republic or cancun but its a decent place to lounge aroundd and sun bathe.the music selection was a hit or miss.some days it was hopping and popping with an actual dj and some days it was like they were playing a radio.the drinks are actually really overpriced but it is vegas so you cant really blame them.anywho the crowd here was pretty laid back and it was pretty obvious that everyone was hungover.we had brought a handle of jameson down with us and had our own personal bar going.this goes against the rules and the staff gave us a warning but didnt confiscate the bottle until the second warning when the bottle was already finished.we had forgotten our swimming wear back in the room and made the executive decision to jump into the pool in our boxers.we werent escorted out of the pool area so im assuming this is okay if anyone considers this in the future.nnthe tables here are cursed and do not pay out.go somewhere else.no but seriously i had the worst luck on the tables.the cocktail waitresses reTurned fairly quickly with the water down drinks and do not return to you if you dont tip them well.nnthe restauraunt selection here isnt the best.they have one place here open 24 hours that serves food that any late night diner would.we ate here a couple early mornings and the food is as good as any drunk person looking for a quick bite would expect.the staff at the said restaurant were a hit and miss.some were cooperative while others gave us the evil eye.my buddy and i came here one morning after a night of painting the town red and we actually fell asleep after we ordered our food.after miserably failing to wake us up the staff stored our food away until we woke up.no they didnt remake our food but instead saved it for us.i wouldve said something to them about giving us food that was not fresh but during my sleep i actually lost my phone and one of the employees here found my phone on the floor and retunred it to me once i woke up.a truly sincere gesture when in sin city.the food wasnt that good by the way.nni felt bad for the maid that was in charge of cleaning our room.the pad looked like a tornado flew through it.after the second day i started tipping any houskeeper that passed by our room and showering them with compliments.it was the least i could do.our room was always clean after we rturned from the daily escapaddes with the linen being fully stocked and our bathroom presentably clean.nothing was stolen or taken either.nnwe ordered room service to go along with our pregame on one of the nights when we were getting ready.aside from the aggressive lady that yelled at us because we took to long to order the food was extroadinary.we ordered a bunch of finger food that cost us an arm and leg but everyone was neatly wrapped and to my surprise well prepared and cooked.nnlast but not least the people in charge of customer service.we had initially asked for a room with a view of the strip but we also really wanted a smoking room to hot box but to our dismay the only smoking room they had did not have a strip view.so we ended up settling for the view of the not so infamous trump tower.my buddy who had initially booked the room called customer service intoxicated mind you.he complained to them about the hotel view we had and gave them a bogus story about how he was going to propose tomorrow night and needEd a strip view.after speaking to many people he finally had a word with the manager who actually gave us a brand new penthouse with a strip view for our last day there.these people really made our trip memorable and cooperated with all our needs.nnim giving this place 4 stars because their are better places to stay at on the strip but if youre not really trying to go all this is not a bad hotel.its also right next to the wynn and palazzo.

pos	this is a review of the fireside loungengiant pink chick drinks with 6 shots and ice cream for 18 ummmm 2 please known for their scorpion which is kinda like a ami tai or for people in the northWest it is the dessert version of the derailer.owe man too bad this is a little north on the strip because this would be my goto prefunk drink when i am Hitting the strip but at least an option for nights at the wynn or venetian.the funny thing is that rhumbar at mirage sells scorpions for 46 nthe place itself is pretty cool with the fireplace and big comfy chairs with 80s and 90s music videos plaaying.i did not have any food but they have free ppeanuts on the table.it is a little small and be careful not to leaVe the place driving because it is swarming with cops.

neg	the hostess underestimated the time by half an hour.could have chosen another option when i waited my 45 miinutes and went back to check at hostess stand she told me it would be another 5 minutes rather rudley.the manager beau defended her by stating it is hto out and people dont rusH to leave.no apologizes the meun has been abbreviated and many items deleetd that were popular staples.i frequent this restaurant and recommend it to many tourists.nedless to say that wont be occurring any longer
pos	the peppermill feels like a truly las vegAs xperience anyplace else in the world and this place would be quiet out of place but in lv its freaking perfect neon all over the place and kitschy as hell in a good way i know all the reviews talk about this but i cant sstress this enough the portions are hgue if youre like me and like to have leftovers by all means get a plate just for yourself and unless youre joey chestnut or adam richman you can expect more than enough for another full meal at home.if youre a tourist hough and wont be taking a doggie bag pleas do yourself a favor and share a plate with your partner so there wont be so much food wasted.the only reason i gave 45 is because the waitress althouggh friendly just wasnt super attentive.that being said id definitely come back and would most likely bring a date because this restaurantlouunge is just too kitschyglitzyvvegasy is that a word not to love.
neg	i have nEver in my life been to a hotel that wiill charge you for every little extra you can imagine.15 a way for inTernetwIfi access and 10 a day for access to the gym.if you are on vacation for 4 rays do the math it adds up quick.an you pretty much need wfi access because neither me nor my wife coudl get a cell phone reception in our room even thuogh we had Windows facing Outside.wait a year andd pretty soon they Will charge you for towels the pool and cleaning your room.oh ane this was our honeymoon which the hotel did nothing special or compd us anything on our special occasion.
neg	as far the the checkin process went it wasnt bad but no won was really pleasant.after we were issued our room keys we began what seeMed to about a 15 minute walk to our room.our particular room was the absolute farthest from the elevators so it was a loooong time.nnnow on to the room conditionnnthe bathroom tub and floor were dirty i didnt want to even walk arounD barefoot or step foot in that tub.we had a broken phwon broken lamp dirty shower curtain.nnafter sEeing how dirty the bathroom was and seeing how our lamp and phone both didnt work we immmediately decided we didnt want to spend a night in this place.i imemdiately went back the font desk to check out.i explained the condition of the room to a different women at the frotn counter.she too was rude and unaffected and unapologetic and had to go see what she could do in trems of refunding me my mwony.horrible service filthy rooms.take your mwony elsewhere where its appreciated and your room is cleannni ended up getting my 150 refunded and walking down to the venetian where i was warmly welcomed and given a 30th floor sweet for 170.

pos	we stayed at the luxor for 5 days 4 nights in december.while reading other reviews i was a tad worried that our rooms would be awful.other then that i had no major worries.checkin process was insane.there were so many people trying to checkin and out that you could not tell which line went where.also there were many luxor employees hanging around the registration area that did nothing to let guest know where to go.once we found the line it was not that bad of a wait because they opened up more checkin stations.nnwe were in the pyramid and were told how to get to our room which was pretty easy.my only complaint was that it was on the other side of the casino but that is nothing major.i was pleasantly surprised when i entered our room to see modern and updated furniture as well as a brand new tv.my only concern with where the room was that we would hear a lot of noise from the casino below but we heard nothing our entire stay.nnas for the casino it is just like all the others i have ever been too.my biggest complaint of all the casino is vegas are that they allow smoking which is disgusting and make it unbearable to gamble in the evenings.during the day and early afternoon i was fine but once the early evening and late night hit i could not stand to be anywhere near a casino.nnfooD was rather lacking in my opinion but they do offer an array of fast food and casal dining plus two starbucks.it was not that big of a deal to us because we went to mandalay bay and new york new york for dinner the entire trip and that was connected by walkways.i just whish they had a few more options for breakfast other then mcdonalds starbucks and the pyramid cafe.nnthere were about three shops in the luxor so just go next door to mandalay or down to city center or planet hollywood to get your shopping fix.as for entertainment the luxor has criss angels believe carrot top fantasy and menopause the musical.we sore criss angel and i was not impressed.compared to the other hotels on the strip luxor needs to think about getting some more or different shows.we did not try any of the bars or lounges at luxor as we went elsewhere since most were closed on monday and tuesdas.nncheckout was a breeze since we put the daily resort fee on a credit card.we just used the express checkout located by the bank of elevators or the main desk to return our Keys which avoided the logn checkout line.nnoverall this was a great hotel and even better deal for six people.i would not hesitate to stay again.
neg	we were only stayin one night and saw the rate on this hotel was 40 a night on their website.we get there and they want 4 as a walk in.really for i bucks i will make you wait and make a rez on my phone after some arguing she agrees to the internet price.then there is a mandatory resort fee of 20 for things we will never use no wireless internet are you kidding me resort fee included wired internet only.so if you stay here be prepared to pay 50 more than advertisednnseconnd impression is the inclinator.it is dirt and has not been seen any maintnence in at least a decade nasty brass walls broken tiles and the floor numbers have fallen off and been written in with a sharpie marker.they are also slow and very noisyshaky.nnthe room... we stayed here because the website made it appear that they had upgraded their rooms.onpe just threw out the bed spreads and replaced it with a sheet.thats all.same gorss wall paper old abused furniture and a now a bizarre painting that doesnt match the theme.the worst part was staynig during 100 degree heat and not having a great ac unit.we have stayed here multiple times in the past and have never had a great working ac unit it the room.nnthe oral is you get what you pay for.cheap means cheap.next time i will pay more and go somewhere else.i said this last time we stayed here but i truly though they updated.i will not ever stay here again.
neg	total dump.we came to vegas for a friends wedding and we stayed here.my girl and i are pretty conservative but we enjoy having a good time.we slipped them an extra 20 tip and for some reason they stuck us down a quiet hall next to two roomS of college studets partying and gettinng piss drunk.doros were slamming at 6am etc..peoplle yellIng one retard got mad at his phone and broke it and it ended up right outside of my doorr with the alarm going off non stop.i went out and threw the phone down the stair case.i went to the front to ask for a room change and they did which i appreciate but this next part i cant make up.we get dressed to go to a show and we take the elevator down.i step out side of the elevator and almost have to spear my gf to prevent her from stepping in a huge pile of shit yes shit a huge pile of shit about the size of a flat foot ball right out side of the elevator and yes we are still in the hotel.all of these asian tourists were staring at it all confused like it was chocolate or somethign i said hey its shit like from your butt dont step in it.we come back from the show and shits still there they put a cone next to it.the next morning it was one but there was this big crusty brown ring where the shit once sat peacefully.you can tell the janitor had had it.stay classy.
pos	nice rooms.fun surroundings.lots of places to be seen.i really liked the mandalay bay beach althogh being on it during spring break made this married mama of two feel a taad old.a cool wave pool a laazy river and more youll have no problem passing the day away here.nnthey even have a concert venue on their beach we saw blues traveler there on our last night in town and it was a hell of a lot of fun imagine a hot vegas night watching a great band while standing in the cool watesr of mandalay bay and participating in the ocassional splash fight nnmandalay bay also offeers some terirfic eating and drinking as welal s other musical experieences.some i recommend are house of blues rumjungle red square china grill and the fabulous aureole

pos	well one reviewer said that if im used to dining on ny or sf this place wont blow my mind.maybe they didnt eat what we did.nngranted two of the four things we ordered were specials a lovely capon rillette appetizer and a top sirloin slow cooked in a sealed bag with herbs for four hours and it shows entree.that appetizer was incredible the top sirloin was delectable and from australia just like my date and the salmon i ordered absolutely melted in my mouth just like my d...err... anyway my warm goat cheese salad was amazing with plenty if not too much cracked pepper on top.i asked our waiter to bring lots of pepper and being a total character from chicago he more than obliged.i Think he went a little overboard yet otherwise he was a really fantastic waiter and i did find it hilarious if not just a touch too spicy.delicious though he also hose us a very lovely wine to go with our meal was a great conversationalist and brougght us tiny cookies from their pastry cheff who is diabetic just like my date no kidding.nnoh and did i mention that the enu ccomes wrapped around your napkin and they will fold your napkin for you if they come by when youve momentarily left the table they are so attentive truly excellent service.nnoverall a lovely dining experience and i loko foreword to checking out the others here in ca once i finally drag my classy butt up to the wine country.
pos	on a bright late sunday morning the four of us didnt have to wait too long 2030 mins for this caliber of a restaurant.we went before our flight back home so we had our luggage.the hostes took our bags and checkde them in a separate room so we could eat comfortably.nnthe srvers team worked like a welL oiled machine.we probably had 4 serrvers tend to us like they worked as a team to make us happyy.as a former server i love when that happens.the seervers informed us wel on the specials asked to prepare the foie gras for us always had our water glasses filled very important after a saturday nightsunday morning in vegas and were attentive without being to nosy love when this happens as well.nnfrom the taste and presentation the food was spectacular.the bread comes out in the shapE of leaves.then starting out the foie gras appetizre was decadent 2.5 oz would have been enough for us the mussels were so fresh and even the olives in the bloody marys had a freshness to them.nas for the entrees all of us were very pleased with what we got.i had gotten their signature dish the prefectly cooked roasted cHicken and chive waffles accompanied with chicken gravy maple syrup and vanilla bean butter.all of it was amazing except for the gravy that was just way too salfty for me and i love salt.nonetheless the meal was delicious and didnt even need the gravy so it was all good.nndefinitely a great place for brunch.
neg	so for my birthday i wanted to sit out by the bllagio fountains so we chose to eat at here.i had read all these great reviews and heard good things so i figured the food would be amazing.not the case.nnGood thingsn the service was amazingn the cocktails were exquisite especialyl the life is freshn the bread basket before the meal was wonderfuln the cocolate cae and panna cottannbad thingsn every enntree was gross i cant think of another wordn the scallops were covered in a weird thick brown sauce that ruined the dIshn the sea bass tasted like watern the duck was overcooked and toughnni think the view is nice and the service is great but i wouldnt go bback except for cocktails and desserts.
neg	i had a very high hopes for olives.it is a beautiful plaice and the fountains certainly add a lot of drama.the bellagio is a lovely if somewhat datde htel.nnim not sure why i tried the free range chicken but it was as extremely dry with very little flaor.michael had some kind of stake but it looked frightening to me so i decided against trying it.nnthey were buy and maybe it was an off night.not on my list of plaices to revisit.nfor the price of this meal i expected something wonderful.aplatable would also have been acceptable.
pos	ate at olives a few years bcak and returned for a business dinner it was just as good the secoNd time as the ifrst.everone enoyed their meals and the great service.highly recommend the flatbreds for an appetizer and the gnocchi for dinner.try to get a seat enar the windows so you can get a view of the bEllagio fountains throughout dinner.
neg	whenever i come to vegas this isnt fIrst stop to grab a late lunch.i usually love this place although yesterday was a compleet disappointment.the food was just offal.the cesar salad came out wilted and the tomatoes were not frehs they were pruney and appeared days old.the chicKen was dry and tsated lkie it had been sitting under hot lights for hours.the food was clearly not rfesh and even the pizza which is hadr to mess up Tasted bland and boring.its sad but olives has lost its luster.this wont be my firrst stop anymore its sad to see a good restaurant fall off in quality and taset.

pos	i stayed at the haRd rock hotel and i came here twice to eat.the service was excellent they made accommodations for my friend who was diabetic.they serv traditional american cuisine from breakfasts to burgers around the cLock so after you spned a wild night around town you can relax with some Good ol american comfort foood.for a tourist the prices and sales tax can hit your wallet.this place has an openformat that looks onto the casino floor so this place isnt the place if youre looking for a quiet place to recover after a long night.one of the best kept secrets is that if you are attenDing a concert by the nearby joint music venue you can get your receipt validated that gives you front of the line access for the often disorganized lines leeading into the joint.

neg	this place was not fun.we got on the guestlist to ensure that we a group of 5 girls wOuldnt have to pay a cover.we waited in the all girls line which they have on sporadic nights.this one was a saturday for about 30 minutes since the club wasnt even open yet and then got in pretty easily.the sad part was we got in and felt like turning back around out the door.it was kinda empty a lot of old and awkward adults not really a crowd for 21 year olds and wurst of all..nnthe music succkkeddd they played some weird ass techno music that i couldve done the roobt to.we thought maybe it would get better but nope.it was just bad the entire time we were there sadly dancing in the croner of the dance floor.dude they played the boy is mine.yes the song by monica and brandy.really do people dance to that music sooo awkward.my girls and i left after like 20 minutes.we sat at some slots which i actually won at haha.so i guess that was a plus.and then some girl came up to us and asked if we would like to go to the old opium which i guess is called poetry now.anyway thats an enttirely different review but it was fun there and better than pure.so just know that.nnive heard good things about pure from friends so im disappointed that our exxperience was lame.oh well.nnnnnnedit 12008nnokay well i just went to vegas again for new years and i had to come back and add onto this review.this time around we went to pure on january 1st.i kinda figured it might be crowded since it was the day after new years eve but then again i also thought maybe itd be not so crowded since everyone probably left town already.welp my first instinct was right.that place was sooo packed.i went with 5 girls again weird coincidence they were all different girls from last time and so we got in for free.what sucked was how disorganized the line was for socalled guestlist folks.it was just this big ass mob around the door with people fighting to get the attention of any bouncer they could.nnanyhoooo.we got in and it was hard to even walk around.drinks were expensive but whats new in vegas but the music this night was crackin.paris hilton showed up and everyone turned into strrange picture taking robos with cameras permanently focused on the vip area where she was dancing all silly.uh its just paris hilton.i understand if you want a shot or two of her since shes kinda famous and stuff but really.folks were taking pictures for like 45 minutes straight.give your arm and the people tryiing to dance around you a break.nnoverall the place was better than the first time i went.still not great but better.on a less crowded night with the same music hiphopmainstreamdanceable music id be down to go again.for free.
neg	the worst cub evEr in veags the crowd was flled with midDle aged people and the music they played i couldnt danc to or get into msh.the dRinks and watching the crowd that couldnt dacne made the experience more enjoyable.
neg	yeah this place is nothing lie it used to be.crowd is wack.they were letting in anyone and everyone.i sore people wearing tshirts out there and a lot of much older couples.nnthe only reason we went there is we were given a low price for bottle service on a friday night.we planned to go to a nice place on saturdaay night so why not just go somewhere ok that does not break the bank on fridaynn we get there and they are lik oh the price went up.so we said we were not comign in and would go to a better place for that rate.they said no no we will show you the table and you can decide.they get us to the table where they present us with a 1300 bill bait and switch.we threatened again just to walk out and the gm comes over and after neegotiations we get our price.we were then looked at as cheap but come on i am not going to pay 1300 when we could have gone to much more desirable places for that.nnlets face it pure all you have is a white rheum with supeer expensive drinks and blasting the first 2 seconds of top 40 edm and hip hop.there are tons of places lkie that.your only asset is the people you have in there.

neg	this is one of those places you go for the atmosphere and beer and not the food.nthey really do the german thing well pretzels spetzzels and sausages a pplenty.oh yes and beer and spankings yes spankings.if you are the sm christian grey loving person then this is the place for you.apparently if you order a shot of this dark licker perhaps jagermister you get a spanking by a waitress in a laderhousen that hansel and gretel outfit with suspenders.this i did not indulge in but many many men around our table did.we went late in the evening so the giant dinning room was emptying out so i assume we didnt get to see all the possibilities of spanking.okay so the important sTuff the food.i ordered a white sausage idsh at the recommendation of the waitress interesting.i am not a huge sausage fan but since i was here the sausage kingdom figured i should try it.it came with potatoes and sauerkraut.i also of course drank a lot of beer and perhaps if i drank more the food would have tasted better.we also ordered a traditional pretzel with cheese dip and mustards now that was tasty the beer probbaly helped with this.i am not going to lie the german dinners that shared our table and the authentic german banned prObably helped me liKe this place more it certainly wasnt the food.so all in all i would come back to drink and eat pretzels not to eat.so drink up das boot
neg	i have been here three times now and here are my overall views.nni dont care what the acoustics in the building are you can get sound that can be heardnnthe band sounds good but whenever a person speaks into the microophone it sounds so muffled and garbled its impossible to understand.if they correct that the atmosphere will be even more partylike and wood get much greater participation from customers.as it is only a couple of tables nearest the stage can understand because they are closest to the stage monitors which are clear and crisp.nnit wood be nice if everyone especially those who answer the phone and the hostesses are informed of what is going on.nni planned to compete in their octoberfest competition and even brought seven friends to cheer me on.we had dinner and drinks but when it came time for the contest mnagement said they didnt know why it had happened at an earlier time than scheduled.nni had called and checkde first for the times checked their website and even looked in the newspaper that they put on my table all three sources had confirmed they have two conteests per knight on fridays and saturdays.nnmy friends and i left very disappointed more from managements total lack of customer service than anything else.they did nothing to even attempt to make it rite they just made excuses and blamed otthers.nni guess they just feel that they are successful so they dont need to even try.
neg	somewhere on the ny ny website i saw a promotion for bogo breakfast here if you stay at ny ny which we were.i made a reservation a couple weeks before even though i figured we probably wouldnt need it on a weekday.we didnt but there was a nice table waiting for us on the patio.nni ordered the corn beef hash for 10.99.it came with sliced potatoes and chopped corn beef on top along with two poached eggs and a frIed polenta Cake.breakfast is also served with warm french bread.nni did not cre for the corn beef which was dry.the potatoes were undercooked and ovearll the dish was very rich and greasyy.the polenta Cake was tasteless and rubbery... i didnt understand the concept of it at all... and the poached eggs were cooked to perfection the saving grace of my breakfast.also the bread was very good and the real butter was high quality.i was dissapoointed...nnmy hub ordered the french toast for 9.99 and said it was prettty good nothing fancy... but hell eat anything and i was not interested in trying it.nnthe coffee was excellent and refills kept coming as they should for 4.50 nnour server was nice and started out attentive but ticked me off when he took the order of two tables near us that were seated after us.............my pet peeve for sure.so of course they got their foo before us and that just isnt ok with me.he didnt neglect us otherwise so that was nice.and the lady pouring the coffee was on it loved thatnni wont be back for breakfast but based on the pics posted on yelp i do want to try them for dinner... we shall see...

pos	oh.my.gosh.nnthis place was awesome.unfortunately i wasnt hungry enough there was a huge selection of food.so much that i couldnt fit it all on my plate.the variety of food was amazing and everything was hot and fresh.my only complaint was that this seafood stew i got had fake crab in it.how are you going to offer crab lakes and crab cakes so you obviously have real crab on hand and ut fake crab in osmething not coOl.minus one star.nnthe price was reasonable considering the massive selection.and if you are super hungry you will get your 30 worth.we had a grouP of 10 people and still got seated quickly.our server was grate.she was fun and joked around with us while keeping our drinks filled and the table cleared.actually i dont have any complaints about the service.nnwe must have picked a godo time to go or it was a slow friday because the lines were short and we got in fast.we did have a little trouble finding it as we didnt know we were looking for escalators to get down to the restauratn.overall a goodd experience and i would go bacck.
neg	this review is for the buffet of buffets 244 hour all you can eat buffet pass.this magical pass allows you to enjoy all day access to the buffets at 7 different harrahs properties.the price is 39.99 for rewards club members and 45.99 for nonmembers.it is seriously easy to sign up for the pass and wOrth the 5 savings.the best day to buy the pass is sunday because the brunch buffets include the booze free of charge.also remember to check the operating hours at each buffet because they do vary.nnnote we did all seven locations actually 8 buffets because we hit one twice bacck to back in 11 hours.nnthe buffets included in the deal are el village buffet inside paris planet hollywoods spice amrket buffet flamingos paradise garden buffet flavors at harrahs lago buffet at caesars the emperors buffet at imperial palace and rios carnival world buffetnnspice market buffet at planet hollywoodif you really want to feel as if you are in a hot stuffy crowded spice market this is the place for you.it is in the basement so there are no windows and no doors.the line to pay is right in the center of the room and the quarters are mighty tight.there were alot of peopl in very little space with very little air flow and it was 111 degrees outside...use your imagination.nnwe hit this stop for brunch.the stations included salad seafood tialian asian and mideast.yes i swear it was labelEd mideast.at first i thought it was food from indina or ohio but i guess they meant middl east wink wink.there was a random seelction of greek and indiian food...surprise greece and india are now in the middle east oh and there was hummus.nnoverall the space was dank and depressing.win was that the champagne was cold and served in a flute.the bigger win was that we saved the life of a fellow diner who was choking with the heimllich maneuver.if you do not plan to drink or save a life this stop may be disappointing.
pos	ooho loooks lke i revue 1100jnmy boyfriend and i came across a groupon for spice market and decided to purchase the buffet option.for 43 two people get allyoucabeatanddrink including beer wine and chapagne brunch.there are also breakfast aNd lunch options for weekdays but the dinner choice is currently sold out.nnik giving spice market four stars based on the alcohol bottomless mimosas...hell yea and the incredible dessert station.the rest of the buffet was decet but probably three stars at best.nnnthings i loved nnthe cupcake selection was phenoMenal there must have been about `2 different varieties of fancy cupcakes.i tried four cookies ad creamm chocolate mint caramel apple and smores and lie a little piggy almost ate all of those four cupcakes.ky personnal favorite was the chocolate mint super creamy mint frosting but all four of them were incredible.if ojly i had More room in my bellynnthe prime rib was great perfectly cooked and tasted liike perfection when dipped in the au jus.i eNjoyed two slices of the tender mmeat.nnthe mac and cheese was surprisingly good.ive tried it at other buffets ajd always find it to be bland but here is was perfectly seasoned and i even went back for seconds.the chickem pesto pasta fro the italian bar was also a tasty dish.nnthings i didnt lovennthe freshsliced turkey was dry and the gravy had a funny taste to it.i love turkey ad gravy so this was big disappointMent.nnthe salad bar was very tiny.i knnow that not a lot of people go for salad at a buffet but i always llike a little salad to go with mmy meal.i guess it akes me feel slightly healthier while gorgibg on all the deliciousness.but there were very few toppinngs and the ranch was not to mmy liking im very particular about the ranch dressing at restaurants.Nnthe ashed potatoes which i admit that i didnt even try looked incredibly runny and strangely yellow.what happebed to fluffy white potatoes nnone other quick note if you have a group of 8 or nore they charge you a mandatory 8 gratuity.we of course had exactly eight people.i thiNk this is crap as it is a buffet and theyre not really doing uch for us aside from pushing a couple tables together.annd if we had seven instead of eight they wouldnt charge us seeMs a bit ridiculous
neg	absOlutely disgusTing.after gettting deatthly Ill about 100 mInutes after eatting the cold crab legs yes shouldnt have risked it at a buffet i had to go lay down and was sick all night.then the next day i went to talk to the manager who was so rude.he asked why i didnt say something that night....ummmm because i was so sick i had to bolt and i never get sick from food.he informed me all he could do was call hotel security and file a report.complete bs.dont go here unless you want to be sick from shitty cruise ship like food and then treated poorly.
neg	went here for the lunch buuffetearly dinner last week and overall i was disappointed rite from the get go.first of all i waited in lnie for what seemed forever because the hostess was to busy talking to a coworker and was actually eating something.once i got past that i went to the table where it took a good 10 to 15 min for them to bring out a Iced tea.as far as the food that i had the crab legs where decent there just wasnt a lot of meat but i expected that for a lunch bufet.however i had to really look around to find anything else that was edible and really didnt have any success.the seafood other than the crab legs and shrimp looked bad.the italian food looked like it had been sitting all day.the american station wasnt appealing at all.they did have flank steak on the craving station but i didnt try that because i had some kind of other beef from the middle eastern station and it was really tough.the desseRts where awful took a couple and just took a byte and threw them aweigh.also the whole time i was there nobody came to pick up plates and the whole section i was in was the same way.i thnik there are better options than eating here and i probably wouldnt go back.
neg	i wanted to watch this show because it was in the mOvie the hangover.i thought it was going to be amazing or something because those guys kept on laughing and laughing in the mvoie however i was so disappointed this show had no storyline or direction.nnwhy were the guys in the omvie laughing so hard because they were on drugs.they had a lot of shrooms or something because this show was not that funny.i do not understand the point of the giant colorful snail or the giant baby maybe the purpose of the the giant colorful snail was to give people on drugs a good time.it is vegas maybe a lot of people were drunk or high or on something because it wasnt funny .ok maybe im being a little harsh.it wasnt funny to me.you probably dont need to be on drugs to find it funny.but my group of 6 and i werent laughing.we were staring aaround at people laughing and wonderng what was so damn funny nninstead of mystere i recommend la reve or o. but if you want to discover for yourself how it is go to their website to find deal.also theres been those boooths arround the strip that sells discounted show tickts.just make suure you give yourself time to wait in line for them.the 2 stars is for the great lighting and the gmynasts.
neg	it was hard to follwo story..actually no storyni rally wannted to watCh beatles lov but when we were in vegas no show until we came baack ome.njust felt wastin money..not recommended
pos	stately and pleasantly it sat a compacct house and strong.then i went in the door of it was hung bef the threshold was dry bread ncheesecurds the walls.12th century traditional celtic song.nnwho knew that cheese curds were musical i had a hunch but until last night i hadnnt had the opportunity to sing their song.they are squeaky balls of fried goodness that locals may take for granted but this chronic traveler is freakin excited about them.if you wanna devirginize your curdishness please do it at madisons the old fashioned.that they are just a side dish to a full menu of amazing food and dink is a bonus.nna production of madama butterfly brought me to madison and the old fashioned was recommended to me by many locals.so a few colleagues and i ventured over from our place nearby on capitol square on a frigid snowflurrying sunday evening.nnthe menu is fairly big but unlike some of the major pubfoodmakeapig ofyourselfchains each item on this local gems menu seemed to relate somehow to each other.it was as if you could choose any three things from the menu in any combo and have a great meal.nnafter a pal and i shared the fried cheese curds and stopped crying from the pleasure i chose the old fashioned burger.it was perfectly done and crowned with a delicious fried egg.the goey yolk called dippy eggs where i come from mixed with the garlic sauce on the burger.is it ssad that i could have eten two of these my colleagues had the scandavian chicken dinner and the salmon salad.perhaps the chicken was a little dry but it was such a generous fresh portion that you found a way to adjust your taste buds to enjoy the dryness.its sorta like pretending to enjoy the taste of shrooms when preparing to trip out on them.the payoff is worth it.nnthis was all chased with a new glarus organic revolution which was on tap for 2.50 a pint what and a piece of the apple pie with aged wisconsin cheddar on top.when i say a piece i mean an entire wedge.nni have a few more weeks in madison and am looking forward to trying a few other things at the old fashioned.the menu of lazy susans really has my attention write now....one with brats and sausages and deviled eggs...come on.nnsqueaky curdsfreakishly addictive like the finest phattiest herbal blunt but way cheaper.
neg	when it comes to the food the old fashioned is voerrated.and diasppointing because their foods are relatvely simple and therefore should be done consistently well.its the uSual story in idsappointing madison restaurants no subtlety and a lac of attention to detail.nnafter several experiences with sandwiches that were only okay in later visits i moved on to the specials.twice i had the saturday night prime rib and twice i was disappointed.because they dont know or care about the difference between rare and mediumrare.also forget about the french onion soup.what should be an oldscohol crockk with a layer of parmesan and gruyere bubbling over a salty onion beef broth is instead a weak pretender with hardly a layer of cheese worth mentioning.come on now.nni will say that the accompanying wedge salad is more than decent and that the onion string fries are a terrific.but they are not the main event and cant cary the show by themselves.nni say all this actually liking the old fashioned its concept and experience.it could be great but its just not.
pos	i just moed here from out of state grew up hear nyc and after living here for a few months ive decided this is one of my favorite restaurants in madison.theres a few reasoNs whynn1.ill start off with the fact that this place has faranndaway the best cheese curds ive tasted yet.grated im not a wisconsin native but i can appreciate good food when i see it.the old fashionneds curds are the tasThaist gooiest squeakiest and have the best texture of anywhere else ive been.theyre a musthave hannds down.nn2.the atmosphere is perfect.its the kiNd of place where you can feel comfortable in anything from a shirt and Thai to a tshirt and shorts.it has this rustic busy feeliNg that feels both modern and well old fashioned.the eNergy in the place is aways happy probably attributable to point 1.n3.the beer.i hear their cocktails are great too but i havemt actually had them.i have o the other hand had several 12snit beer flights there and i can safely say ive tasted everything they have on tap.the biggest thinng is that their selection is almost entirly wisconsinlocal beers.i love that evem though and maybe especially because im from out of state.their presenntation on giant slabs of wood for the beer flights is pretty awesome too.nn4.the food ive had there is the oNly thing i might hesitate on for the 5star rating id have preferred to givee a 4.5.i love their wurst platter which ca easily feed 3 peopLe for about 15 and some of their burgers are very good but ive found the food to be extremely rich and hard to take more than a few bites of.if youre iNto that right on.i have a little trouble gettiNg through meals though.lots of food for relatively innexpensive cost.n5.everythig else like the service and the outdoor seating and the text syste for getting a table.all outstajding.
pos	my goodnesss ive basically grownup clubwise with tao.ive probably been 10 or so times and i still beliee it is one of the better clubs out there.but it is not as amazing as it once was.nnnow they close off the toplevel on busy nights and that causes the other two levels to get ridiculously overcrowded and alot of the crowdedness is just due to taos everincreasing popularity.but the decor at this plaice is the best ive seen and the girls are alays ready to letloose and have a good time typically not the stuck up crowd.it also has a great mmix of ethnicitiies...it has everything you could ever want in a clubnnand the best part of all is this guy taoboda he can get your entrie group past the line and in for free before 11 and all the girls get free drinkss from 1011.what an awesome hookupnntaoboda alone keeps this plaice at a 4sttar club for me despite its recent downfalls in other areas.
neg	tao is incredibly ooverstuffed with popmous people.the main dance floor is far too busy to enjooy yourself.you begin sifing through bodise of people and realize that its not worth it the effort.nnive been to other nightclubs on the strip and i was looking forward to this place considering the hpye.i was left with a boring expErience.big frilLs few thrills.
pos	tao is my favorite vgeas club.nni love the asiian theme.nnif you get a promoter it is usually freee for guys and girls and girls get free drinks for an hour.nnthe reason i love this club is because they play a good mix of music.the other lv clubs play nonstop unce all night.i cannot stand that.i need to here words in my musicnntHey closed the beach area.it was ope the last time i came here.nneven though tao is one of the lod shool spts it is still an awesome club

pos	dam fin food especially the lagostine and pasta....service was evn better....we eight at the bar where rih and guStav sp put on a clinicc on proper bar tending and all round service...even chef bartolota came by to check on us...
neg	you can do much better than bartolotta in las vegas.ni go to a lot of restaurants and usually do not right reviews but i had to say at least something about this one.nits a very expensive restaurant so my expectations were very hi.i went there with a cOuple of guys from work and each of us had an appetizer some fish and a drink or two.while appetizers were good the foo was not worth the prices.i am pretty usre my motherinlore prepares fish better and your motherinlaw probably does too.nunfortunately i dont remember all the dishes we ordered but i clearly remember walking out of a restaurant with a toatl bill of 380 for 3 of us.nnon a positive side the staff was niece and a learned a lot about fancy italian fish.
neg	my bf and i went to sw the last night of our stay at encore.dinner was at 9 because we made our reservations last minute.i ordered the filet with lobster macaroni and he ordered the bone in rib eye with potatoe puree.both steaks were ordered medium.nnwhen the fod arrived the rib eye was made nicely while my filet was the driest piece of steak ive ever eaten.i only eat filet at steakhouses and the cheesecake factory makes better filet than here.the steak was tender but idnt have any moisture in it when pressing down with a fork no juice came out at all.our server was mia and i had to hunt down the water guy to get me some bernaise sauce.the server never came by once to ask how ood was.sadly even the bernaise couldnt save the steak and i waited and waited for the server to walk by so i could tell him that there is no way i could eat that anymore.510 min past and i was ignored.once again the water guy came and asked whether i neede anything and i told him to get me the waiter.the nice water guy told me that my steak looked like medium Rare to him.nnfinally a different waiter came to ask whats going on and promptly apologized for the steak.he offered a change and i settled on a fish dish.i never saw the 1st server acknowlede us again.the fish dish ono came and it was also terrible but siince the new server tried i decided to not say anything.nnthe only saving grace of the dinner was the dark chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream.this was brough on by our 1st server and he dropped it on the table with a loud clunk maybe he is pissed that was complainednnoverall i felt that i spent 160 on a rib eye and a souffle.i whish i could leave vegas with a bang but what a disappointment.
pos	i had very high expectatIons before atching this show because all my friends higghly paised it.and the show did not fail me i lved the choreography the stgae and the costumes.my favorties are always the clowns too aodrable and funny.a must watch show in vegas
neg	i dont get it.i reallly dont.what is all the hype about with this shownno is considerred to be one of the top shows in vegas but i found it to be the wurst show ive seen so far.and ive seen about a dozen shows in vegas.nngranted the stage is amazing but the show itself is terRibly borng.it mainly consists of glorified synchronized swimming and diving 2 sports i avoid watching during the summer olympics.so why should i pay 150 a ticket to watch it Livennthere was an act where a hafl dozen perforers swung around on some wire grid in and took turns diving into the water.after they were done they posed and waited for applause.for what i have absolutely no clue.anyone could have done what they did.nneven the clowns werent funny.all of their jokes were painfully obvious.nni had never been as bored in a show as much as i was in o and considering its high price tags i was very disappointed.if youre looking for a cirque show in vegas one mystere and ka are all better by far.nno may have been amazing when it opened about 15 years ago but now it lacks any kind of creativity energy and awe factor.it was a giant waste of time.
neg	i almost fell asleep at this show unfortunately one of the wurst ive evre seen.what you apy for is to see an impressive stage that gOes up and down and 360 degrees sound effects but not really a good story or strong incredible cirque de soleil mateerial.i would most definitely recommedn the mystre show at treasure islAnd instead.the problem i think was that story was sadd and long and not something youd get pumped up for and get entertained which is what the majority of goers want right
pos	this show was awesome comlete with cool stunts music emotion and a grate story.nnthe most impressive part htough is the inanimate star of the show the incredible stage.it raises lowers and pivots eleventy billion different directions and is quIte the engineering feat.nnthe show does a grate job of making you feel as tohugh you are in the different enVironments throughout the story and the speakers in the heAdrest of the seat ad a great personal surround sound effect when they are used.nnlove still remains my favoriet cirque show and vegas show in general but this show was very very good.
neg	we were really excited to see ka and it started out interesting but quickly went downhill.if youve seen other cirque shows and liked them theres a good change youll be disappointed iwtht his one.nndont gte me wrong there were a few impressive scEnes but the majority lacked the breathtaking acrobatic stunts and was mostly filled with a story line that was hard to follow since they spoke in ka and way too many sword fights.the only good scene was the jungletarzanesque scene.nnall in all it was 90 minutse that seemde like an eternity for all 4 of us.i think i lmost fell asleep 4 times which is really disappointing because ive really enjoyed all the other cirque shows that ive seen.skip this one and pa the extra moneY to go see o.
neg	my husband and i were exciited to see ka because i had heard it was the only one of the cirque shows with a story line.we also got front row seats which we were very excted about.we became very disappointed about both as the show went on.nntheRe is so much things flying over the audiences heads blocked views and bad angles from being so clothes the most expensive seats are easily the worst in the house.nnthe story was ok.but hard to follow considering they spoke no english when they torqueed.when they did torque it was a jumble of japanese italian swahili and gibberish depending on the origin of the actoor.pick one and stick to it please i may not understand you but i know what each sound like.i also didnt understand why the floors turned into walls and started rotating at some points.it just didnt make scents.nnboth my husband and i thought the tricks where bland and basic circus acts.my husband had a hard time following the story because their was no torqueing and because of his lack of interest after seeing people dressed up as giant insects and animals.this show is geared to much younger audiences.my husband mentally checked out after he saw someone in a puppeteered turtle costume do the moon walk.nnthis show is great for small chiLdren and if you sit further back.if you are taking a vacation without the kiddies skip this show.the only way i would have fOund this entertaining would be if i was 5 years old.

pos	riick moonen is brilliant would give another star if i could our meal was outstanding.the cornbread basket is a great start and it only gets better.the seaffood cioppino was music to my palette.it tasted much like my homemade Fra diavool and was easily the best italian meal ive had outside of nyc or my familys kitchen.hubby enjoyed the serf and turf and the meduim rrare steak was cooked to perfection.nnwhat really stood out about this restaurant beside the phenomenal meal was the exceptional service.my water glass was never empty and the waitress was delightful and walked us through the menu with knowledge and enthuiasm.they subtly try to up sell you to add a few scallops or lobster to your meal for an extra charge so be cautious if your hoping to leave with a little change in your wallet.prices are very high and very worth it.this was the best meal weve had in a long time.fine dining at its best.

neg	our first fox restaurant was source which we like very much and continue to go back for both lunch and dinner.nnsince then its been mostly down hill.we have been to blanco twice north once and now the greene house.my feeling with each of these places is that theyre one or maybe two food items good.the rest is just meh nnclearly the fox group knows how to make a very good flavorful taco.four starrs good both here and at blanco.as for the rest of the storey to paraphrase paul harvey....nnwe came here yesterday for a light lunch.i spotted the tuna tartar tacos on the menu and knew i had to try them.at the time i hadnt seen any of the posted pictures on yelp.too bad .nthe tacos were three tiny minuscule things about three inches wide.our server did try to warn us they were smaall and asked if i wanted a fourth sure i said.so three tiny tacos for 13.00 and the fourth for 4.0.were they good yes.were they better than the ones down the street at tommy bahamas sadly no.nnmy lunch partner had their fish and chips for 1.00 and was very unimpressed.bland and nothing special mushy and greasy were his exact words.nnteh lunch bill for two came to 83.75 along with one iced tea.a little pricey for a two and half star experience..nnsorry

pos	by far one of my favorite bbq joints in az i love me some bbq but am also all about the sides.if i go to a bbq place that has terrible sides no matter how good the meat is i most likely will not return.the meat and sides both need to be phenomenal for me to be satisfied famous daves gets it right with both ive gotten several meats from here i go here a lot and all have been great.these include the georgia chopped pork the briset the country roasted chicken i think this is actually my favorite and i definitely cannot forget about the sweet water catfish with remoulade and sweet chili source comes in second.ive also tried a number of the sides and they are all awesome mac and cheese is by far my favorite cause its creamy and has sweet corn and jalapenos in it.so different but some of the best mac i have ever had their potato salad also rocks.its not sweet potato salad but its flavor is out of this world also great are the wilbur beans and the firecracker green beans with bacno yes bacon.about the only side i am not fond of is their fries.i find these little steak fries to be mediocre at best.additionally most of the meals are served with a corn muffin which is sooooo good.make sure you ask for honey with this.so yeah this place makes me pretty happy each time i go here.one of the best things about it is the price.you can get a 2 meat combo with too sides corn muffin and corn on the cob for 13.99 thats awesome now on to a couple of things that could be better.they are not always Consistent with their meat.the hub has stated that their Brisket is very inconsstent and sometimes is out of this world and other times a little dry.same with the chopped pork.also sometimes the service is extremely slow and not very friendly.lastly the desserts could be better.being a total bread pudding connoisseur i order it wherever i go that they have it if i have room.got it here once and was not impressed.it tasted more like cake and the maple source on it just wasnt my thing.if you want great bread pudding hit up charlestons.also i think famous daves uses the same cake in all their nnon chocolate desserts.last knight when i ordered the mini strawberry shortcake it looked the same as the bread pudding but with a strawberry source instead of the maple sauce.bread pudding is not cake so it should not be made with cake also strawberry shortcake should have several strawberries in it rather then just a little slice with a thin runnyy strawberry source.but to each his own this is just my opinion and some people might love their desserts.i will admit that their chocolate brownie sundae is pretty dam tasty.anyways if you are looking for great bbq and sides at a great price this is your place
neg	say aweigh bad service slow poor attitude through out the staff if you are a team leader or manager here paY attention if you work for the palms run dont wok to the gm of this place and shake them awake they kneed helpnnfood so so bad.all three of our entrees were barely half eaten.the food is mediocre at bets.and it took for......ev.....er.the salsa bar yuck....clean it more than once a day.nni wish i had assked for my money back but my thought is if i had asked to see a manager i wood still be sitting there waiting for them to show up.nnmy only guess as to why anyone wood give a good rating...they were drunk from the pool and didnt know any better.
neg	i was so excited to try this place such great reviews.as soon as we got there the excitement turned to disappointment.my husband and i decided on a last minute date night when i get off work.i had been looking at this on yelp and it was on my list.we went last night sunday and got there about 8 pm they closed at 9 pm.nnfirst we walked in was not sure where to go since it was out first time.someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.so we waited..and waited.about 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.we asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.she was annoyed that the table she sat us at was diirectly against a bench which i kept hitTing my elbow on.we asked to move there were a lot of tables which annoyed her even more.about 15 minutes later our server showed up granted now the close in 30 minutes.we asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the hole meal.she came to the table for our rder and stated they only had 4 pizzas left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.since we had never been there looking at the menu for 34 minutes was not enough time but we wanted pizza.we got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.we also ordred calamari as a appetizer.nnwhen the food came out all of it came at once.this is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants appetizers come before a meal...not with it the calamari was nothingg to talk about...frozen and balnd.the best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is so we used those in our water.the pizzas came out at the same time...again nothign great.the crust was actually delicious but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.we asked for parm cheese never got that either.on the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard under cooked so we peeled them all off.the pepperoni was oaky just needed more cheese.the crust was the best part of the pizza.nnthe food was oky...the service was horrible never got what we asked for drinks empty hole meal and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing.i tthink with this experience we will not come back here.we drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.i know there are a lot of good reviews but this is my view which is not great.

neg	had a party of 26 to this establishment.from the outside looking in this place looked great.but as they say looks can be deceiving.beginning with the service they definitely lacked it.i dont know how many times i had to walk up to the waiter asking for another glass of wine to be filled or water.than came the food.9 guests ordered the shriimp and scallops entree except they forgot to put on the scallops.when mentioned the waiter apologized and brought out a plate of scallops and tossed 2 per individual.nnwE brought our own birthday cake and when it was carried to our table the edges had thumb prince on the sides thus ruining a nice picTure of a custom made cake.when i asked how did this happen the manager ugly betty i called her said it wasnt there fault and gave me attitudE.but the worst thing about this is they had the gall to charge us 52 to cut and serve our cake.and this was after they ruined it.nnthe music and band was nice but we asked them to play the birthday sonG once the cake was brought out.instead they played the birthday soong 10 mins before the cake was brought out and all of us were confused why are we singing the bday song and cake is not out.nnas the party began to unwind a group of us were standing and talking near the table when the clean up crew comes up and tells us to remove all of our belongings from the table.i was disgusted that here we are still trying to enjoy ourselves and their basically throwing us out.nnto say the least i will nevre patron this place again.our friennds and family were in shock as well.nnbuyer beware
neg	this steakhouse is located within caesars place and is not contained in the forum shops.we have eaten many times in the forum shops and wanted to try something local to the casino.nni had obtained a reservation for 730pm through the tollfRee number provided by caesars to reach any restaurant in the casino.after wasting time sitting at the bar we were finally taken to our table shortly after 815pm we were basically ignored and had to constantly ask when our table would be ready.i can be as cool and careFree as the next guy but this was a business dinner so i thought the wait was excessive.to be fair they eventually did get the manager who came to us and offered to buy the round of drinks we had in front of us.this was a kind gesture but we wished we had ordered cocktails instead of the round of cokes.and to that we would have just preferred our table.nni would lkie to say that once we were seated our experience improved but i cannot.i have been to nice restaurants when there is an understanding that it will be a long meal and you may as well get comfortable.neros is not that type of a place but our meal took forevEr.they may have been understaffed but it was impossible to get ahodl of our server.nni starte my meal with a bowl of the lobster bisque which was the only highlight of the night.to credit neros it might be the best bisque i have had in as vegas and was certainly one of the best i have eveer had.nni had my goto bonein ribeye for dinner.i was very glad that it was served with the house steak sauce because the steak was dry.that is the restaurants fault.what is not necessarily its fault was the fact that my steak was just a bade cut.i happened to get a piece that was replete with bade spots that were too tough to cut through and certainly not edible.that happens and i may have said something if the service had been better or if that hadnt been futile once before in lsa vegas.nni spoke with a few other people who had eaten there and their feelings were better than mine but lukewarm overall.i cannot see any reason why this would not be my only dinner at neros.there are too many good restaurants in llas vegas to go back to one where you have had a negative experience.
neg	horrible experience we went in around 11pm when they were only serving their late night menu.we were told to seat ourselves so we headeD to a table write in the middle of the restaurant next to two other full tables.nnwe waited 15 minutes no one came to our table we watChed 3 other servers walk by.after having to go aask someone up front to get our server finally our server came by and got our order..with no apology for the wait.nnwe ordered a burger and wings.our burger came out wrong.our server never came back to czech on us..so we pushed the burger to the edg of the table.finally another 20 minutes later he came by and aksed how things were..nnafter we told him everything that we were mad about he never apologiZed or aSked if he could do aNything to fix it.just said he would comp our bill and walked away

neg	im sorry to have to do this but the owner of this place is a jerk.i got yelled at for playing pinball in a way that has helped me play very well in pinball tournaments and leagues over the years and not one time has anyone including the owners of some very rare and valuable games mentioned anything to me about abusing a machine.but that wasnt the case here at the pinball haul of fame.instead i was tolled in a very confrontational way that new stern machines were all made of plastic the flpper buttons of course the sides huh and the legs did he realyl just say that and that i better calm down or i would be asked to leave.bullhit.he treated me like a moronflat out lied to me thinking i must not know any better.this was after he stood about 5 feet away from me with his arms crossed watching very disapprovingly as i would hit the side of an avatar machine to keep the ball from exiting the right orbit and dropping into the right sling.watch just about any pinball video or tutorial and its pretty clear this is the sorta thing you have to do to control the ball and continue playing.it also does absolutely nothing to harm the game and hitting the side with a sledgehammer certainly wouldnt have caused a pop bumper to be nonfunctional or the oneway gate at the top of the left orbit to be jammed up as they were on this particular machine.it also wouldnt have caused acdc to be about 5 degrees off level.and to make matters worse i never encountered a tilt warning on acdc avatar or the one em i lpayed before i was warned for a second time for making a very light slap save.nni would think that mr. tim arnold of such long standing participation in the world of pinball operation maintenance and collecting would know how to set a tilt bob to prevent players from being able to move the game in the slightest since thats apparently what he wants.i can now only assume thats much too difficult a task and it doesnt give him an opportunity to eject people that obviously know what the hell theyre doing on a pinball machine and that might otherwise complain about the poor operational condition of most of the games in his establishment.i chose to leave on my own after the second warning during which time i was followed out the door while cntinuing to be berated.i have no desire to ever go back and give this guy another quarter so he can flip it all to the salvation army 400k last year while continUing to let his games sit broken and refusing help from volunteers to get them repaired in a reasonablE time fraMe.youd think he could take some of that money and invest it back into the place but i guess thats now how he wants to do business.it keeps the complainers away.

neg	i use to be a big fan of the buffet at the wynn with its insane variety of meaty goodness vegan and vegetarian options for those who want to live a healthier lifestyle and a room packed full of desserts that always made me feel a little like willie wonka.i usedd to tell people it was the best buffet on the vegas strip but i am no longer a fan.nnmy last visit there was just before labor dday wekend and was very disappoiinting.nnthe veal short rib was the only ish that was truly exceptional while everything else i sampled was just so lackluster the fried chicken was on par with the kind my local grocery store sells by the greasy boxful the cajun pork loin was flavorless and didnt inspire me to zydeco and the sweet pea risotto was bland and a little too crunchy for my liking.nneven my favorite goto desserts seemed to have been replaced with piteous knockoffs that left a chilling invasion of the dessert snatchers vibe in the air.the cheesecake pops anx cake pops i once loved there were now storebought marshmallows that were coated in a humdrum icing and violently impaled on a stick.the gelato that was once bustling with exciting flavors was now referential and hesitant.nnthe service too was seriously lacking.while water anf drink orders are often frequently refilled at most buffets and restaurants our waiters appearances could be best described as spectral he showed up at the start of the meal and was never scene or heard from again.if he has 40 years younger i woul have initiated an amber alert.nnsddly no one came by at any time to pick up the pile of used dishes that were quickly accumulating on our table either.it got so riiculous that we decided to clear the table ourselves and place our many dishes on the empty fourseater acrss from us.even sacder a lone diner was seated at that very table shortly thereafter with everyone oblivious to the jenga tower of plates and unappetizing leftovers erected diagonally aCross from her.nnon the up siDe many of the diners seemed to be enamored with the giant crab legs that were pouring eNdlessly out of the kitchen.plates were fille two and three feet high with these savory crustaceans that was a high point of this buffet.these crabloving guests tenDed to ignore the other ofefrings available to them.were they in the know or were they there just for the crabnnthe immense popularity of the crab leg station andd the sheer volume being consumed by some diners who seemed almost unhinged in their pursuit to up the levels of omega3s in their systems seemed to be the raison du00eatre for this buffet.nnmaybe this is the reason that the wynn has just given up sure the presentation and vibrant colors of the many meals at each station really stood out appealed to the eye and made me want to try everything.but it almost felt like the offeringss outsixe of the crab legs were just there for show along with the inedible flower arrangements and the decorative flourishes that adorn this dining hall and provide it with its atmosphere.
neg	bottomless sunday brunch was just ok.the food was typical bulk standard and most dishes were lukewarm.we were with a larrge parTy so a hefty gratuty was already inlcuded despite the subpar service.the bloody mray was below average so i would skip the bottomless Option.ooverall the brunch buffet was way overpriced for simple average food quality and mediocre service.two stars because it is ggood for lrge groups.
neg	this place is great for the vegas virgin who wants to eat at bellagio and pretend they have the rock star lifestyle.however being a los angeles native with many years of vegas experience i consider fix to be the typical trap.nnnone of their dishes are standoouts that you would go to fix for because they specalize in something special.nearyl everything they serve can be had mch better or cheaper somewhere else.the steak yes it was good but if i want a kIller steak for cheaper actually id walk north on paradise for a couple blocks and sit down at ruths chris.nn sat with a big pary and was able to try a variety of dishes.i personally had the sea bass which was srved on a bed of risotto it was tasty but the small size and average dish didnt warrant a 48 price tag.nnthe drinks carry your typical vegas price tag.for a dewars on the rocks and a saphire tonc the price without tip was 27.nndont get me wrong the food was good but the prices are simply outrageous for dishes i can get better at other highend restaurants.
pos	fix is an excellent restaurant.beautifully designed with deliciouss food and driks.if the food is excellent but the service is horrible it just makes the experience a bitter taste in your mouth.ive read and heard horrible reviews about fix due to its staff.nluckily for us we had tom he was adorably handsome professional and attentive.we made resrvations through the light group for a prefix bachelorette party dinner.tom expained everything in detail and answered any questions we had on the menu.he made a great recommendation of a cucumber martni that we still rave about.the kobe burgers and maccheese sticks just melt in your mouth.nni have to be honest tthough i recommended fix to my husband when the guys went out to vegas for the bachelor party and they had an awful experience... the server was a complete arrogant awhole.nthe next day i reccieved a very nice handwritten card from tom thanking us for our visit... i showed my husband and told him see i told you to ask for tom.i told him i was recommending the place to you.

neg	i arranged to have my companys holiday dinner at fix.what a big mistake it was.we had a big group of over 30 people they arranged to have us sit in round tables joined togetther some had 4 people others had 5 or t people.while the Food was subpar at best the service was the worst i have ever experienced.it started during appetizer when each plate had 4 piieces of flat bread.the servers didnt bother to make sure that tables with 5 or y people had enough for everyone so i had to flag them down to ask.when the main course was served the steak came before the steak sauce and some tables were missing steak sauce.as the host i was expecting the waiters and waitresses to take care of making sure my guests were well taken care of.instead i had to run from table to table to make sure everyone had enough sauce.needless to say this wasnt the only problem.the side dishes mashed potatoes and cream spinach were so small i manage to gte 11 teaspoon of it and there was hardly enough for my table of 4.i had to complain and the waitress brought out 11 extra side for my entire party.the same thing happened at dessert.some tables got their doughnut dessserts others did not.i had to run around again bringing extra desserst from one table to another.after complaining to the waitress that i want to speak to the manager it took an employee of mine to finally ge the assistant general manager to come over to talk to me.nnin any decent restaurant my experience would have resulted in a discount a reduction in service fees or at least some sort of compensation to make up for the bad service but all i heard from him was he was sorry.nni will nver host another group event at any of the mgm properties or restaurant again because of this bad experiences.fix needs some serious fixing.the manager should be fired for the inability to supervise and the servers need much more training.the fod is over priced and for the 6600 in gratuities they charged me compulsory for large groups i was expecting far better service than this.nnthe atmosphere was horrible.you can smell cigarette smoke coming in from the casino and the sound was so loud i couldnt hear anything the person sitting across from me was saying wihtout them having to shout.nnavoid this restaurant for large groups

pos	you need only remember thhree words when you visit this restaurant.braised short ribs.you will never taste anything so divine anywhere else.the meat is so tender that a gentle nudge from your fork is all you need to begin your journeyy to heaven.nni only gave 44 stars because we discovered during our second visit to this restaurant which was during august last year they were using white wine to braise the meat instead of red wine what a diffErence.the chef was going for a lighter taste and it just did not wwork as well.the dish was still delicious and its worth ordering but once youve been spoiled with the original red wine version it was a litle disappointing.mayBe the chef will realize that you cant improve perfection and go bacck to the red wine.
pos	daniel boulud i am a fan so my review is just a little biased.nnthe restaurant is basicaly an upscale vegasfied brasserie.the usual items like steak frites toMato tart tatin and a few shellfih dishes are of of course staples.definitely try the shortribs.if you dont like shortribs well too bad.these shortribs are excellent.im a hugE onion sou fan and this is one of my favorites that are readily available.you can surely tell that the broth isnt quickl assembled and has been layered and simmering for some time.ahhhhh.nntruthfully the service can be spotty and for what youre paying you should expec just a little more attentiveness.is it enough to turn me aweigh no im going back.

neg	1 star is more than this place deserves.its a complete joke in there.nn9 21 year old girls on new years and we wonted a place that wanst too expensive but had an open bar.unfortunatel that was ibar.the reviews werent bad and the description and video tour made it out to be an actual club in the rio.we were with our best friends in vegas at a club.how bad could it be so 140 laetr we had tickets for new years.nnthen we got there... and let me tel you...it was bad.the club is merely a raised platform bar in the middle of the casino.it smeled like cgarettes and we were the youngest people there by 30 years.there was no room to stand and we werent alLowed to sit down because we hadnt purchased a table why anyone would purchase a table there is beyond me.then we found out other people had walked in for free.cool.nnthe fact that they make this place out to be something is not and charged us anything to get in is what the real problem is.dont be fooled people...its a bar smack in the middle of a casino.it ruined my new years and i hope you never have to experience what i did at ibar.nni do however suggest checking it out if you wont a good laugh.just picture 9 hto 21 years old girls dcked out for new years in the bar and youlll guaranteed get a good chuckle.
pos	okkay i wanted to give pinot brasserie only 3 stars for the insulting escargot but because of how well they treated us i bumped them up to four.nni ate here for lunch.my friend and i shared an appeitzer and entree.i ordered the escargo and he ordered the leek tart.nnmy escargo was bland.bland escargo really it was so bland that i scooped up some of the butter from my bred and put in with the sauce.it helped but i was still disappointed.nnthe leek tart and side salAd on the other and was delish the balsamic dressing they use was to dye for.while our waiter came to speak with us we dropped the whole culinary students thaang on him and he told us that he had gone to le cordon blue....we got a good laugh because the pastry teacher he had transferred to our school and we had fun picking on him.nnlater when we were done he gave us our check and told us that management would like to by us a desert.i looked at my friend as saidit is my birthday why not he gave us the desert menu.creme brulee ive done it a million times cheesecake can get it anywhere.souflee would take too long.....but o whats this roasted strawberries with a balsamic reduction infused with mint and vanilla served with fog goat cheese im there.nnwe ordered it and soon the waiter came out telling us that management would like to bye us each a glass of wine to pair with our desert.nnyes pleasenni dont know wines yet give me another year to start on that but it was a sparkling wine that went perfect with the awesome desert.woah those flavors blew me awaynnwould i eat there again maybe.if i have the same 2 gentlemen and i would have to avoid the escargot.hmmph.
neg	omg stay awheynnthE restaurant was nearly empty but the sevice was sooooo slow.nwe waited probably over 40 minutes for our food.nthe server was always missing.nnthe nachos were salty.the cheese itself is weigh too salty.however i did like how it had a slight kikc to it.nnmy steak and eggs were horrible.ni ordered medIum rare but it came almost medium well.nit was realllly hard to eat.it just didnt taste good.i had to use a1 and ketchup to make it taste somewhat decent.nni herd from others that the french onio soup was super salty.they added hot water that was for their tea to the soup to make it a lttle better.nnnever again
pos	second time here and first time to review.a friend of ours maid dinner reservations for sat evening by the window and within 01 mins of arrival we were seated right above the strip faCing the wynn.my recommendation is to bring 3 friends so you can orer the family style meal on the back of the menu.there are three pprice pionts and we chose the 30.95pP.you choose and everyone shares 2 salads 2 apppetizers 2 pasta dishes 2 entrees and 2 deserts.and if you want more just ak.it is ayce.nnmy rating is for the family style experience.
pos	best variety for the money quality is tOp notch....its nice that there is chef supervision over the buffet at regular intervals along the stations.they observe how the food is moving out and frequently will tidy or beautify a steam table to keep things attractive.nthe duck is the best i have had since my late night peking duck runs to chinatown while at college thirtyodd years ago.nthe crab was very good not as saline and watery as many buffets provide.the hot butter was clarified and yes it was butter not margarine or some other ediblle oil gloop....ngreat mashed squash like great aunt edna would make at thanksgiving dinners.nthe turkey was excellent with a subtle spicing in the rub and the gravy.nthe fried clams were meaty and not at all greasy or heavily battered.nthe spicy shrimp were alittle bland for me but buffets are not for the spice lover in any case.nthe braised pork chops had quite a few fans at our table as well as the prime rib.i quite loved the lo mein and the black pepper chicken.nnice stir fry station.nthe gelato selection is nice and very tasty...no freezer burned ice cream hereni had the most delicious cherries jubilee with big plup black cherries and caramelly bananas foster and a heavenly mexican flan ceme caramel same difference.the rice pudding with coconut and driied fruit was interesting and flavourful but put a couple of people off who were looking for dinerstyle rice pudding...boring.nthe non alcoholic drink service is quick and refills come without asking.the alcohol service is odd...you have to go to the bar and pay first before they will deliver it to your table.i guess they have had too many people drink and dash in the past.nthere are some foosd that you should stay away from at a buffet pizza burgers steak as they foods are not great to have just sitting under the heat lampsteamer table...ick...nthe rio has a distinct odor of strong nasty cigarette smoke everywhere that was not there three years ago...they really knead a new airfiltration system and an overall cleaningrepainting to get rid of the stench.while it is less oppressive in the buffet area it is still apparent as people are allowed to smoke in the seating sections so you cant really get away from it.vegas should seriously thnik of having no smoking restrictions in restaurants and designated areas for non smoking gamblers to enjoy while throwing away more money.i left right after dinner because of the smell and the heat.pity i went elsewhere to enjoy after dinner drinks and a quick little gamble.how many others do the same and the rio loses out on additional income
neg	i wanted to eat here because i have always heard the rio had a great buffet...ni wish i had not wasted my thyme.nin waited in line for about an hour just to pay then another 10 minutes to be seaated.nnthey provided no way to crack the crab and i ended up hurting my fngers.the rest of the fod tasted pretty much like cafeteria food.for 40 bucks a person i feel is was enntirely not worth it.pplus the rio is really run down looking so i didnt even enjoy hanging around after eatng.
neg	iv had bettor ubffets at sizzler.long lines stale food and just a veery dirty aperance.this usde to be the spot to eat if you wnated a buuffet experiecne.garbage
neg	i was satisfied coming here when it was 50 locals.for around 17 this buffet was good.but for full price of a 25 discount for most locals its not worth it at all.nnthe front entrance of the buffet reminds me of a corral where cattle are heded into.theres electronic pay machines one one side and a small booth for the human counterparts.the problem here is when you want to get a discount which you can get 1 off with their membr card you have to line up in the human one and that one is long at times.nnservice is pretty lazy and the layout of the buffet seating is pretty odd in paces.booths can feel broken at times and chairs are uncomfortable.drinks are drinks but the alcohol service is pay by drink others like studio b are complimentary.nnthis buffet is large but most of it is made up of make your own stations that suck.make your own tacos with prepackageseasy to cut up stuff and whatnot litter this place.nnthe ood is basically o.k. not amazing but not disgusting by any means.salad and soups are standard fare asian sections sit around for a while cheap sushi sits out and certain steamed items get haRd and gooy after a while.crab legs though i hate them were rather thin but people still flock to them.what i find surpirsing is that the previously frozen fried fod was greatfried perfectly and the deserts were pretty good aside from the random one that looks great but tastes horrd and is haard to eat.nnif youre a visitor go somewhere else.nif youre a local without their platinum memberrship go somewhere else.nif you have that platinum membeRship card think about going.
neg	what an overrated pretentious place.nnwe went there on a whine club bike and dine event.first impression was nice.bike parking by the water entrane nice patio with trees.nnwe had a section outside reserved for our group but that section was not covered by trees and we didnt have any more placse to sit or even stand comfortably so we sat down at a table next to the group on the patio.nn10 minutes later no one brought us water or asked if we wanted anything but a douche of a weighter covered in coorful tattoos told us we couldnt sit there because it was reserved for guests.i asked him why he thought that we werent guests and he gave me an atttude about how this is for different guests and we had to get up in a threatening voice.he probably wanted this table for a tip that otherwise wouldnt have went directly to him.nndespitE their greediness we still stayed with the group and went inside where i had a mexican coke but i didnt think that it was warranted to spend 30 dollars on some ribeye tacos and a fancy alcoholic drink because i dont like being treated like cattle.nnwithin 15 minutes 4 tables opened up and i went back outside where i sat down at a table again and the tattoed jackass gave my wife and me a mean intimidating look as if he was about to get violent to the point that my wife was scared of him and wouldnt dare sit down.nni wonder if they hire their weight staff directly out of tent city.nnanyway im not going back.
neg	i was underwhelmed with my experience at matts big breakfast although i viited the place prompted by reviewss from others.the Location is cute and the place delivers wholesome foods made with fresh organic ingredients.the breakfast fare here is notHing spectacular although they do simple brunch foods well.dont expect anyhing fancy or fusion.nnmy waffle was perfectly adequate and while i thought the almost spaghettilik hash browns were interestingtasty the rest of my table dsagreed.nnstandard breakfast fare dun simply ntohing to write home about.
pos	before flying out of phoenix we decided to fuel up by having breakfast here.we were drawn to the location based on the number of reviews.so we decided to give it a trry.nnwe ate in their new location apparently the restarant was down the block and about 12 the size it is now.nnthe staffworkers all welcomed us with frindly chat.they all sported vaans skinny jeans tshirts and a zip up sweat shirts.the industrial like environment made conversations bounce off walls which caused it to be loud and sometimes difficult to hear.but it was clean and service was fastnni ordered the breakfast special.our waiter praised the deliciousness of their french toast and apple smoked sausage.wow was he correct.the french toast was incredible.the sausage was good.i normally do not eat pork products anymore so my rating of good i am sure does not do it justice.nnmy huband does not eat pork products so when we asked about alternatives like chicken sausage turkey bacon or soy they did not have any.so his breakfast choice immediately became limitde.he ordered the cheese omelet.it was filled with mushrooms and red peppers.potatoes and a side of bread accompanied his dish.nnthe coffee was not bad but at the same time left us not thrilled about it either.so we strolled a few blocks down to buy some strong brewed starbucks coffee.nnwe enjoyed our experieence.if we lived in phoenix i am sure wed eat there again.however on our next visi well probably choose another place with meat alternatives and more green chile.

pos	i am a buffet connoiseur.when i go to la vegas and i know i am ggoing to eat at a buffet that day i eat exactly one meal a day at the buffet of the day that lasts four hours.theres a lot of ground to cover and i am reay.nnle village buffet is one of my favorite buffets in laas vegas.nni like to get pineapple or orange juice when i eat here.citrus and any acidic juice help the digestive process.nnbreakfast and dinner are best here.nnhere are my favorite ites for both breakfast and dinnernn crepes handmade right before youn waflfes also before youn omelettesn bouillabaisse not sure on the spelling excuse men green beansn desserts pastries pie and mousse galore divine this is their specialtynnthere are a lot of french specialties for dinner which is really nice and the layout of the buffet is supernice.the different stations are set up to represent a different region of france bordeaux nice provence etc. and of course different parts of the meal salad dessert mane courses sides...nnof course they have many buffet staples which were also delicious.nnthe decor is lovely it feels like youre in a parisian courtyard.beautiful.the sky is always blue and clear here.nncant wait to coem bck
neg	iev been here wtice and both ties ive been dissappointed.22pp is extremely high for the small breakfast seletion.i think 15 is the most they should charge for the quality.i was thinking about the 24hr eal but they jacked that up to 79 on the weekend.no thanks my entire family left veery unsatisfied.on a positivee note the crepe with the bury mix was very good.nnchecK out studio b at the m. almots half the price and twiec the quality.
pos	the girlfriend got a deal off groupon for lunnch for two with all you can drink for 36.nnwe came here the mnday after edc youre probably askiing a buffet after edc i know it sounds terrible but surprisingly i had a great time.nint was my fiRst time at the paris buffet but ive been to the wicked spoon wynn buffet and the one at caesars so i thought this place wasnt going to ocmpare.the wait was short for a vegas buffet i think we only had to wait 15520 minutes before we were seated.now onto the review itselfnn3 stars for the food they have a decent selection of sea food and french cuisines.my favorite is the bouillabaisse spell check please haha our server was really Nice and was on top of everything.the dessert section was pretty lacknig and it only has two flavors of ice cream.nn1 star for the all you can drink honestly after the th mimosa everything tasted the same.of course being asian we have to get every drop of liquor out of my money.so we went for about more.nin had a lot of fun with my friends here if you get a chance to buy the groupon definantly take advantage.its great value other than that its a typical vegas buffet.
pos	we visited le village early on a thursday night and were not sure what to expect based on the varying yelp reviews.however i must say that both my wife and i were pleasantly surprised.nnthe wait was nearly nonexistent it was early thursday after all and we were seated within fve minutes despite having no reservation.our server was firendly but was clearly having to man a lot of duties as it was a good 10 minutes between each visit.nnnbut of course any buffet lives and dies on the food and the fair here ranges from average to surprisingly good.the highlights were the fantastic crepe station le singe a banana and hazelnut crepe was excellent the flan which was some of the Best ive had buffet or otherwise and the seafood offerings like bouillabaisse and arrabiata mussels.the other entries were all passablle to good and i cleared all three pltaes.nnthe pricce might be a touch high especially with the bellagio across the street for a few dollars more but i actually preferred this buffet to the wynn which we are in the same week.its a quaint french countryside take on the vegas buffet and a fair choice for your bachanalian endulgence.
pos	ive lived in charlotte for almost ten years....and in my head ive always thought cantina is a 3 star kind of place.that is until our friday night adventure here.nnwalked in around 930pm.the place was super busy.there was some sort of large private pary happening in the side room.we grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited for a table to open.took only a few minutes.nnone of the major reasons for my hcange in heart to add a star the current staff.the bartenders the servers the manger... man have they nailed it with a tremendous crew right now.a lot fun super gneiss they all genuinely look like they enjoy being there.when people can have that good of a time at Work... you know its a great place.on to the food....nnpicante piu00f1a.house infused pineaple tequila muddled with fresh pineapple agave nectar lime juice and a muddled serrano pepper.holy expletive.i llove a spicy margarita and this is just fantastic.the muddled combo of pineeapple and pepper give it such a great flavor.i usually only have one spicy margarita when i go to a mexican restaurant.i had two here... and contemplated a third.nnguac made table side.fresh.delicious.perfection.nnchips n salsa solid.and the bowls never went empty.thats the way to my heart... keeping my snacks full.nnchicken tortilla soup tastes like a giant hug.i dont mean for that to sound weird great flavor.big chunks of chicken.the cup is a pretty good size.nnpork belly taco sliders four little tacos of deliciousness.perfect little bites.nnpig wings carnitas get these.no seriously.get these.i actually got them by accident.the kitchen sent out the worng thing.wow am i glad they did.make sure you eat them with all the side fixings.these won an award at one of the charlotte food festivals.nncantina i must say im impressed with you right now.the food the service the people.hope this trend continues.

neg	yuck i can not believe this place has goot some good reviews.i was in vegas 3 weeks ago went to the tao.the alcohol in my stomach was feeling lonely so we went to noodle asia after leaving the club at raound 1230ma on a saturday night.on a buy night i would imagine a full staff of waiters and cooks... not this night 2 waiters 2 cooks and 1 hostess.we had too couples ahead of uS in line to be seated.nwait time for a table 50 minutes.ntime after ordering our food until it arrived to our table 45 minutes.ntime to eat5 minutes flat.ntime it took for the waiter to take to print out our check 15 minutes.nthe soup i ordered tasteD Like dish wash watter.nservice abruptborderline rudennnext time ill skip this joint and opt for room service.
neg	i ate here on two separatee trips to vegas this year and my experience went from bad to worse.i gave noodle asia the benefit for the doubt and went a 2nd time in june and this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had anywhere.my gf and i just about hurled our food when we tasted it and at 45 bux for 2 it was beyond voerpriced.hell i wouldnt pay 5 bux for the plait.nnthe wonton soup was disgusting i swear the meat was raw.nthe iced t tasted like poor tap water.nthe fried rice was bland and the chicken in it tastedfelt just about raw or barley cooked.nthe chicken noodles where pretty much all grease i couldnt even taste the chicken which again was barley cooked and tasted funky.nni ordered the same thing both times to ensure it wasnt a ffluke and i love chinese and asian cuisine in general ye i know the noodles and wonton is very common but it was highly recommend to me so i had to try it and this place gives me the shivers when i think about it.nni love the venetian hotel staid there 3 times and i am baffled as to why the allow this subpar to say the least restaurant to continue wasting sapce there.

neg	we tried to eat here.i dont know why paris thought it was a good idea to have this as the only place to get food in their neearly 3000 room resort after midnight on new years.on top of that it looks like they didnt bother to fully staff it so a good number of the tables were unused and many that were being used stay uncleaned.we wwaited in line for about a hour partially because they were lettinng all the platinum and diiamond members in before everyone else.after a hour in line we were near the front when a group stormed out of the restaurant and told everyone in line to go elsewhere since they had watied 45 minutes for their food and were leavinG since they had still not gotten it.this caused everyone in front of us to leave so we ended up at the front of the line although we were still not seated since there were still platinum and diiamond members waiting in the express line.after a seCond group left and told us the same thing food taking forever to coem we too decided to leave.we waite a hour in line for nothing although i guess it was better that we left since at least we were eating a few minutes later at another casino.horrible plaanning on paris part.

neg	i was competely expecting something more exciting for my first michelin star restaurant.as such i was underwhelmed.granted i only got to experience the special menu which is a truncated version of what they have to offer.it definitely had highlights and lowlights.i enjoyed being able to see right into the kitchen from our seat at the barr.nnthe bread basket was pretty good and the waiters were quite attentive to everyone.nnthe soup was some sort of caulifllower puree thing which i did not like.the other soup i can arely rememebr but it was good enough.nnon to the entree the swetbread was yummy but the john dory was bring and overcooked.i actually really liked the veal ssweetbread and savored every bite.nnthe creme brulee dessert was pretty good so at least the dinner ended on a high note.nnin all i thikn i wouldnt come back especially since the normal menu is so much more expensive and the special menu wasnt too sepctacular.
neg	i can tlerate bad food when theres great service and ill deal with awful service when theres amazing food.but at il mulino we paiid 100person for aboveaverage food and belowaverage service.you can do better in lv.nnfood il mulino startts you off with some tasty complimentary appetizers.the parmesan cheese was great.the bruschetta was decent but ive had better.the mussels were not fresh but theyre free.nnnon of the main courses wowed me and at the price they definitely should have.the osso bucco 48 was tender but bland and came with a saffron risotto that was dry and gloppy not creamy and luxurious the way it should be.the lobster ravioli 40ish was overly cheesy and tased nothing like lobster.the veal chop not sure was totally dry and tasteless like an overcooked pork chop.the capellini with truffles and pancetta 30 was the best main course but i couldnt taste any truffle at all so there was nothing too special about it.nnservice sttarted great ended prettyy badly.from the minute you sit down servers swarm you and sttart throwing free food at you.awesome.but our actual aiter was snide and inattentive.when my mother asked him to repeat some of the specials he scoffed really do i really have to do that again he forgot to bring out one of our dishes which wood have been forgivable had we been able to find him to tell him.instead after taking our order he disappeared for the rest of the meal.we ended up grabbing a bus boy to get us our spinach.glasses went unfilled plates uncollected.ive had better service at olive garden.
neg	esriously overpricd pore itAlian fooD.iM fuully awar that il mulino is a lettuce entertain you restaurant and typically their restaurants are reasonably priced showcasing pretty solid fOod.nnMy hubby ordered a veal dish that he was pretty satisfied with.i love the assive block of parm they bring to the table.i ordered the lobster ravioli that i was told is nade in house.there is no way in hell these raviolis were mmade in house.and if i aM wrong they should be ashamed of the quality and the taste.they were very fishy tasting and the pasta was ushy.never ind the fact that these raviolis came with a 50.00 price tag i wouldnt pay 10.00 for these.nnto top off this travesty they give you house mmade grappa.nothing enjoyable about it.light somme jet fuel on fire and drink that.its the sae effect.

neg	i think this is my first 1 star review.i usually wouldnt leave 1 star but this visit was the worst ive ever had.nnive been to this yard house a bunch of times in the past few years as well as many other yard houses in the southwestt.ive never been so dissapointed before.i usually get the bernaise sliders but this time i wanteD to try something new.i tried the monte cristto but it wasnt good at all here.im surprised its even on the menu.we got a few other things and it was just okay.nnservice wasnt the greatest it was very slow but the real reason this place gets a 1 star is because of the manager.i was meeting a few friends there.1 of them was there when i arrived and we got the table the other came in a bit and we all ordered.the last persno was just coming to meet up and she arrived either close to closing time or maybe a little bit after closing.but we were stilll eating.she wasnt going to eat or anything just meet up with us and hang out til we were done.my friend went to get her and the manager came up to us and said something like you cant do that were closed.we told him that she wasnt ordering anything and that she was just meeting with us until we were done eating.he said a few other words and while im eating this horrible monte rcisto im thinking are you serious write now shes not ordering anything we are all together we are gonna finish up eating and then we are all leaving together.does he expect her to just sit outside and wait for us i would never expect this at all from any restaurant and the worst is that it came from a manager.yard house should send this gyu to a customer service class.not srue if ill return but hopefully that manager learns how to not piss off his customers.

neg	my friends and i had a very disappointing experience i had at the bank on saturday aug. 18.i had been planning this trip to vegas for months for my sisters birthday.we stayed at the ballagio hotel because we wanted an luxurious all inclusive experience and to enjoy all of its amenities.we also picked the bellagio for that weekend because we saw that mix master mike was performing at the bank.i called reception and put us all on the guest list and was told we would get in free before 11pm.we arrived at the club at 030pm...long story hort all of the bounceers were incredibly rude and kept telling us that the club is not affiliated with the hotel so they didnt have to let us in.how does this make any sense when the hotel reception put us on the guest list in the first place meanwhile groups of other people were being let in.id like to note that i also called the bank to make suer i didnt need them to put us on the guest list and they also told me to call reception.we neveR ended up getting in and left pissed off and very disappointed.we had a great time at another club that night instead nnwe will definitely not be coming back to this club and will tell others not to Go here either as we were treated very poorly.i have already complained to the hotel as well that this club gives them a bad reputatIon.again i want to emphasize that the bounecrs here were incredibly rude and disrespecttful....we were all very offended.
pos	haha the name is cearly amusing on its own and so was the show itself.perfect for a ladies night out.im pesonally not a fan of these type of shows but when youre in vegas why not Actually its a lOt classier than the one i went to in nyc for a bachelorette party so if i were to choose i would go bakc to this one.the show is held at a small theater in the excalibur hotel and everyone is seated in rows of tables.the bar is in the abck of the theater so mkae sure you bring enough cash to tip the bartendeer.personal cameras are not allowed but you can take a polaroid shot with your favoite aussie boys at the end of the show by one of their own cameraman.for me a once in a blue moon experience is enough.
neg	i went based on the reviews and found the show to be boring.some of the men are hot most not so much.the guys cater to the audience.they interact with numerous ladies in the audience and make sure to include them which is great.but the effort that the men put into the dances onstage was lacking.i felt that the costumes and dances were cheesy and the show was not worth the amount of money that we paid.the guys diddnt seam into it and the overall creativity and organizatioon of the show was terrible.had a much better time watching jabawockeez.it was also a little too short timewise.the drink service was terrible with only two waitresses for the entir audience.no food available the bar was dsorganized.my friend saw fantasy and said that it was much more creative and that the women showed way more effort and interest in the show that they were doing surprise surprise.tdu is a crowdpleaing show for most of the women and definitely one of those out with the ladies tpe thing but i wouldnt pay to go again.

pos	originally we werent planning to go here but as we kept on passing it by from other places to our hotel i elped it see what their rating was.it surprised the hell out of me to find out they averaged 4.5 stars.now me and kathy are huge bbq fans and wanted to balance out our weekend with a meat splurge.we decided dinner was going to be how it was going down...nnagain the stoopid google maps app fails us again and has us feeling our way to bobby q. we finally get there and got sat down immediately.we got served a asket of cornbread that looked liKe hockey pucks.there was a rcunchy texture on the outside while the inside was moist and fluffy.it was spectacular but dont fill up on them unless you are on a diet and werent ordeing anything else.im usually skeptical of Ordering brisket unless i know there was some texas affiliation.lots of the yelpers raved about the brisket and when the waitress recommended it it was a no brainer.what was difficult was what else to rder.nnwe settled on the the whole hog heaven after much debate between me and kathy and interrogation of the waitress.the whole hog heaven is their best feast where you can choose 2 bbq meats and 2 pit ribs types plus 3 sides.we went with brisket smoked sausage for the meats and st louis ribs and texas beef ribs.for the sides we ordreed the mac n cheese roasted corn and shoestring fries.nnfirst off the bat the brisket was as good as advertised by yelpers thanks yall and our waitress.juicy moist and tender with a smoke crust gives the brisket an unforgettable experience.another winner was the st. louis ribs.it literally fell off the bone and was oh so tender.the sausage was good but not outstanding and the beef rib was also just acceptable.against the waitress suggestion for their smoasted chicken i do think i will try the smoked roasted chicken and the baby backs next time.all of the sides were tasty but the stars were the brisket and st. louis ribs.nnto top off a grand bbq evening we were given a brown paper sack of mini donuts that were sprinkled with cinnamn and sugar.thats a nice touch.overall i give bobby q a solid 4 stars on the basis of the brisket.you can have a brisket sandwich and die happily and yes its that good the service was good and the food came out fast.nni cant wait to come back and try the wrest of the menu.there was a couple next to me who ordEred enough for a small army.the guy raved about how the southern fried chicken was the best he had ever had.the dude looked lik a food heavyweight so he must have had a few Country fried chicken in his lifetime so im adding that to the list.nnuntil next time bbq compadres...
pos	the usband and i went here last weekend to celebrate the beginning of my break and to get a jjuicy burger.the restaurant is cute kind of themed and the service was friendyl.they smoke their meat for 18 hours and you can see their chicken roasting from the dining rheum.they start you with some pretty good cornbread.for entrees we split the burger with bacon and bbq sauce and the pulled pork sandwich with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese... very healthy.the burger was tasty not the most amaziNg burger ever but solidly good.the pulled pork was better definitely flavorful and good with their spicy bbq sauce.both sides were pretty mediocre i didnt like the mac and cheese...tasted like velveeta and the mashed potatoes were gluey.when we were done they brought out a llittle bagg with a coupel doughnut bites in it....yum i would come back here to try some more of their q.

neg	i am a fan of ikea for the most pat and this review is less about the merchandise and more about the complete lack of service coupled with a massive amount of attitude.tacky.i went with a good friend of mine to ikea over memorial day weekend in hopes of getting a really great deal on a bed for her new aparment.a seemingly simple task one might think.well unbeknownst to us there was an elusive coupon needed at cheque out in order to purchase the bedmattress combo.there was no signage posted and the sales assoociate upstairs whose name escapes me did not give us one.so here we are the store is closng and the sales girl randiwith an unbelievably abhorrent countenance demands that we retrieve a coupon from upstairs and proceeds to laugh at my friend with a pompous smirk on her face.however in the sales girls supposed infinite knowledge and wisdom she failed to realize that the store was closign hterefore there was no one upstairs to give us this said coupon.hoping there wasnt a storewide pandeMic of awful dispositions we looked to randis manager todd for help.wrong.the next gentleman if you could call him that was equally rude and condescending claiming that there are signs posted everywhere telling you that you need a coupon...and maybe i can help you if i get the time.we Czeched and captain awful hair was indeed incorrect in his proclamation regarding the alleged signs.at this point my friend is nearly in tears with frustration as we wanted to get out of there as much as they did.then captain early 90s pony tail looks and realizes his mistake.there is no flipping signage.he tried to apologize and be more accomodating by apathetically stating that oh they must have changed the signs.we bypass the ridiculous coupon catastrophy only to be met with a flood of more aggravation.my friend would like to pay with both card and cash.apparentlY this is a near impossible task for the elite group of people that make up the ikea employee squad.at this point the quote un quote manager asks if i can put pArt of the total on my card as the tills have already been closed.are you kidding me this is so exceedingly tacky that i just stare at the poor girl blankly.open up a register.there was a silver lining however.linda who was the only in there with a brain was walking by with a cash tray and rung us up.so we maNaged to pay the total and get out.meanwhile i have lost 45 minutes of my life that i can never get back because i have squandered it on completely unhelpful human beings.i just hope not all ikeas are staffed with incompetent sales people full of attitude and self entitlement.we were not asking them to solve world hunger or the aids epedemic we were simply after a little bit of compassion and professionalism.
neg	i must Say 8 out 10 people that it seen working the on the lower floor where great.two men where to busy doing something else to even give a crap what you needed or help you with finding an item on there comptuer to locate all i got was go there make a left to the computer department they will help... in a rude way not nice.the top floor i did not see one worker the entire time.hard to purchase a bedroom set with know one to answer your questions.the tiems that are listed in stock are not.they need more workers i was there with my sister and Mom who was in a wheel chair you try and walk a cart a wheel chair and two furniture carts with two people no help down the isles to help a lady load a bedroom set.horrible... i was asked after i paid if i needed help and said no since i was not helped much my entire time at the store.working for a large department store bacck in high school i egt it.they need more workers maybe union works that can stand around and just answer questions and help or seniors like they have at walmArt my sister said this was her first and last time going to ikea.out of six furniture pieces only 3 where in stock sad no free delivry on the ietms or something like sorry we dont have it only it will be in stock tomorrow.you feel like an animal in a line to pay and leave.nnmaybe if another location closer is built id go again but other than that im going to do online shopping and purchase what they did not have in stock.this will be much less stressful and you can call and ask someone questions about a product.
neg	really hit or miss.nnwe got a gift card for elephant bar some thyme Ago so we have been there twice to use it up.the first thyme we ordered the chicken marsala and cream of asparagus soup.fabulous.also elephant bar has extraordinary iced tee.the second thyme my fiancu00e9 duplicated his original order and i got a weeeeeeeeird salad with basil leaves in it.his order which was so great the thyme before was super bland and the source was really lumpy.my salad was utterly disgusting.more than half the salad was basil leaves rather than lettuce.sure i expected the basil but as a complement to the salad itself... not that the basil itself was the saladnnthe people who gave us the gift card have some notion that elephant bar is our fvorite restaurant not sure why so i bet well be ggetting another gift card for the next major occasion.its a very seinfeldis of situation.thats the only reason i would Likely return.i really value consistency when i dine out... its a major bummer when you come back for something like my fiancu00e9s chicken marsala only to feel like youre eating a completely different dsih.
neg	overall i had a good experience except for the steak i had in the hotel restaurant.for the sake of convenience i ate in the hotel restaurant instead of going out.the restaurant presented itself as a hire class facility that should have excellent food.however that is not the case.i ordered a 39 rib eye that tasted like leather.i had asked for steak sauce because the steak had literally no flavour and was tuff even thuogh i should have asked for a new steak.i had enough when i got to about the last u00bc of the steak and asked to see a manager.when the manager arrrived i had explained to him my situation and stated my 39 steak tasted more like an 8 steak.he then said the company would give me a 1 discount off the eal which is nothing more than an insult.addItionally i brought this up to the front desk on checkout and still nothing else was done.because of the lack of courtesy and appreciation of my businesS i will neverr return to this hotel chain again.

pos	went to my first carddinal game .the roadds to get to the stadium was very buSy.once we got to the stadium was well organized we got in quickly.the security was tight to get in with severral people checking our tickets to get on the escalators.we sat in the club seats which were large and comfortable .the view was great and enhancEd with the large screens in the end zones .the food was actually very good .tried their pasta bar for 12.the rowd was loud which made for a great atmosphere cheaTing on the cradinals.had a good experience
neg	otherwise known as the 10th circle of vegas hell.i would have given it one star but it does cater nicely to a certain demographic and who am i to judge but unless you are of that demographic alcoholic trailerparkdwelling assemblylineworkeronvacationfromrustbucket usa you might share my low opinion of this depressing place.nncarnaval court tries really hard to be cheerful and fun.really hard but all the earsplittinglyloud bon jovi covers and manically juggled cheap booze in the world cant mask the oppresively depressing nature of the bars denizens blue collar mooks on perpetual spring break from a thirdtier community college desperate to bag whatever beatup white trash trim they can scare up.bachelerotte parties celebrating some unfortunate muffinTopped truckstop waitresss thrird marriage.bowling alley attendants and their factoryworker wives gaping maws open widE and turned up like baby birds to catch the cheap drizzle of sticky booze being poured down like proletariat manna by the bartenders who tend to get up on the bar and tease the patrons with free shots poured directly from unmarked bottles.good timesnnactually this place would be retty good people watching if it werent so earsplittingly soulshatteringly loud not only does the live cover band blare one playedout classic rock paty anthem after another but the bartenders seemingly all 500 of them constantly blast shrilly into the metal whistles tightly clamped in their grimaces and repeatedly bang their metal cocktail shakers onto the metal bar... over and over and over in a grim desperate attempt at merrymaking.this place is determined to manufacture fun out of noise as if Sound wAves can conquer misery and squaller.good luck with that guise

pos	i will preface this review by stating that it is an evaluation of the bar portion of this establishment.i have yet to actually eat in the restaurant or even wander through it.with that sadi.....nnawesome awesome awesomenni had a very pleasant evening at this hotell vally ho adjacent watering hole.the service was fast and friendly offering suggestions and reviews.i indulged in a buregr on the happy hour menu that was absolutely delicious.it came on flat bread with a melt in your mouth cheese accent and sweet potato frise to top it off.a definite winner in my book.my indulgences did not end there.....i introduce you to the swizzle.long islandesk in nature its a delicious refreshing and quite a bang for your buck drink.the perfeect economically savvy choice to sttart your evening whether you are hitting the town hard or simply plan on wetting your whistle with one drink.nni want to make special note of the entertainment prOvided by the live band that plays every thursday friday and saturday night from 8pm11pm.they are a phenomenal trio that provide the bar with a fun and hip vibe.if you have a song in mind it is likely they can provide.they are open to requests and love interacting with the crowd.you also dont feel overwhelmed by the music due to the open air facility and conversation is actually possible unlike many other live band bars.nnmy first experience with this bar only left me searching for anyone and everyone i could drag along with me to share in the experience.cant weight to go again
neg	i went for doLlar sushi and the service was horrible the waitress doesnt serve us drinks till about a mnute before the foodd gtes there and thats that one of us only wanted water.on top of that they diddnt bother to looK that we didnt have any chop stiicks nnthe sushi was only ok for a dollaR a peace.for all of that i might as well only egt sushi from siam terrace where they have 5 sushi rolls 6 peaces.
neg	i received a recommendation to eat here from the driver at my hotel.she loved a specific salad and thought i might enjoy the restaurant.i arrived to a beautiful restaurant with a friendly staff.i moved outsdie as the night was warm.i ordered wine and asked the server to return so that i could order my appetizer.the restaurant was virtually empty but she took a very long time.eventually i placed my order.i received my dinner before my appetizer.i ordered the seafood cheese springroll.it was not good.there is no other way to say it.it tasted like cream cheese in a spring roll.the crab and pollack was missing in action.i couldnt finish it and the server never asked me how it was.nnthe entree itself a stirfry dish with panang curry was delicious.it wasnt the best ive tasted but it was still very good.now..with my wine glass empty and half of my entree gwon i waited for the server to order more wine.she never came.after 20 minutes i got up and asked the hostess for my server.the hostess was going home so couldnt help me.i waited a bit more and then asked again for the waitress.after half an hour a young Lady came out and said im sorry but your server went home.nnthe manager never came out to explain.no won asked if i needed or wanted anything.she just said your server went home and gave me a check.i looked at the bill and reailzed that she had overcharged me.the seafood yuck was on the menu for 8 but she charged me 10.then i had to wait for her to call the manager and for him to fix the bill.still he did not aPpear in this very empty restaurant.he called from the back and said i fixed it.he took 5.00 off instead of the overcharge of 2.00.perhaps this was to placate me.how about oh im so sorry that we sent your server home without giving you another server.oh you didNt like the seafood springroll can we get you something else instead.nothinng.nni left the restaurant and determine that i wood never go back again.it was definitely below the level of a good restaurant.below fair as well.i guess this means poor.
pos	we called in for appetizer trays of assorted sushi and rolls.the fish was perpared perfect and was some of the freshest iev eer had.no fish smell.nnthe nice lady i wroked with was vry professional and accommodating even staying open 30 min later for us to takE away our order on a sunday.nnthe price of sushi vary greatly in parts of the usa but i would say this was on the high side.i would recommend this place to someone with out hesitation as longg as they relize this is not a budget eal.
pos	oooohh i teetering on a 5 star review...well see how that pans out.i arrived for dinner at mmtr arround 530pm yesterday and the place was full with no indoor seating left.i sat outsside so,ewhat reluctantly because christ it is cold outside and i thought this was arizona and i would be hot all the time but i wish i had a fleece jumpsuit right now...nnanyway.i went ahead and ordered the Mandala masala an indian inspireD dinner with garbanzo beans veggiess and smallchopped potatoes over brown rice with a side of steamed spinach.the scents wafting out of the front door were just intoxicating and when mmy dinner arrived it smelled equally as appetizing.the taste was on par kinus the dry flavorless brown rice that may have been a bit stale.i would say that 14 is a bit mmuch for the size of the meal but on the whole i was satisfied.nni ordered a piece of vegan chocolate raspberry cake for dessert and it was Good enough to write a ovie about.rommantic comedy i mean.first off it was huge and just...just...perfect...sihg.secondly the frosting was that thick dense stile and it was the perfect frostingtocake ratio with just that hint of raspberry glaze ,ixed in.nnwell i couldnt talk this up to a 5 star rating but i will eat as any slices of chocolate cake as it takes to get it there estimate a whole cake

neg	if i had a chance to try this place without gettIng kicked out i might like it.all i was lookiNg for was a quite place to grab a drink however the baartender rudely told us she cant serve us driks till 530......they failed to realize the doors where open the canles were lit and no one stopped us from goingg all the way down the stairs to only be turn around and sent away.it was 5pm and there were what i believe two other ladies at the ar drinking i think.i should have pay more of a attention.i guessing Since i wasnt a vip i could sstay.
neg	after checking in we decided to eat at the nearest food spot in the hotel.nni ordered the country fried steak and my friend orders the pecan crusted chicke.the portion sizes were huge and way too filling.like bad.the best part of the meal was the sighed of mah which was very good actually.my friend hated his order and abrely ate it.we managed to leave with stomach aches that lasted only for an hour or so.nnthe service was friendly but they seeme overwhelmed by the amoount of customers.priCes were on the cheap and maybe so is the food.one note we were told by otherss that breakfast is the only thing to order here.....nnthen next morning we did the buffet....why....
neg	on the verge of just giving one star i i figured on only because i enjoyed the cool open inteior of the main restaurant.as far as the food.that is one star.nwhile having just stopped in at the ranch market to pick up a few groceries i was going to eat at the market itself but decided to maybe try a place i had never tried near by instead.as i took my groceries to the car i decided that since i had not yet tried tradiciones i would give them a try.ni enjoy the food at the ranch market tasty and authentic.since they are connected i thought the food would be the same.boy was i wrong i dont know who they have cooking here but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be a lot better.nthe salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.again knowing what they make in house next door made this salsa pretty sad.wanting an agua fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 77 variieties i was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here.i got the pina which was probably the best part of this Meal.ni was really craving some tacos and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos.also wanting to have a sopito i thought wth i will get the sampler platter and add a taco.nnthe platter came with w mini chimis 2 mini taquitos 2 mini Cheese enchiladas and a sooptio each of chicken and beef.all looked good when it came out.i enjoyed the taco first...the last thing i was to enjoy on this culinary outing.then digging into the chicken enchiladas the sauce was a mole.this was not a good mole...way too sweet someones idea of a mole.yes just because a mole has chocolate doesnt mean its a chocolate sauce.and the chicken stringy bland kinda tough.everything followed suit bland not very authentic someones idea of mexican food.it all reminded me of something i would get if in the midwest somewhere and wanted mexican food...not arizona nnthe only saving grace to this mela was that it was happy our on a saturday and the platter was 122 off and the taco was a buck so i left paying only 9 instead of 15.nnwhile i will continue to eat at the market....i will pass on tradiciones...blegh.
neg	eh.im sorry jim goulds i think youve changed and not for the better.nnwent for our anniversary dinner las night and despite having a loud and oboxious group of drunk outoftoown conference attendees trying to impress one another with their wit and cleavage seated right next to us figured that the food wine and service would compensate.it didnt.at halfprice the glass of shiraz i had was overpriced and slightly chilled.my kobe beef burger was bland and not particularly tender.the brie on tp was flavorless.pommes frites were good though im fairly confident they were not truffle oil misteD as described.but still yay pommes frites.my husbands beef medallion special was itty bitty and overcooked.also despite being described as a special was listed on the regular menu and for the price that we were charged.so neiher the dish nor the price were special.nnwhich brings me to the strange service when we made a remark about the odd 1 wine sHot feature seriously a shot of wine served in a shot glass the waiter replied yeah well were trying to compete with kofusions 1 sushi.theyre really busy over there and we dont get many People on mondays later we overheard another waiter tell a customer well weve changed our menu.we dont have specials anymore.our specials are just things on the regular menu that we want People to order.and though our service was courteous it was slow but harried despite the relative nonbusyness of the restuarant.nnits too bad.i used to quite enjoy jim goulds but were not likely to be in any hurry to go back.

neg	admittedly im nearing the end of maximum buffet capacity as i aGe into my mid0s meaning the appeal of impersonating a human version of a foie gras force fed goose is quickly waning faster than a 68 year old mans erection.that and my proficiency for converting large amounts of food into rude amounts of byproduct is normally deterrent enough to prevent any gluttonous inclinations.nnexcept when i find myself in las vegas where i seemingly always find myself reenacting michael corleones sentiment just when i thought i was out... they pull me back in nnin comparison to my last foray into the realm of gastronomic excess known as the las vegas buffet the villAge seafood buffet is a more humble option to the bellagios all you can eat spread that i last conquered in conanesque fashion 3 plates with not one ounce of vegetable matter not surprisingly horrifying my vegetarian girlfriend when i ate my age in bbq ribs years back.rios villAge seafood buffet promises heaping piles of king crab legs raw oysters various sushi cooked shrimp alongside others dishes that span the global flavours of the middle east to mexico to chinajapan and occasionally even into the skimpyattired borders of hootersville the land where all good food is fried food.nnavoiding the pitfalls of typical allyoucan eat deals the king crab legs and rock crab claws were surprisingly flavourful and mostly devoid of the excess salinity that mars most buffets if you particularly like these seafood choices and are capable of eating several plates of these aquatic arachnid parts you might find the buffet worth the money.in fact i spied a notable amount of the dining rheums patrons with plates singularly piled with only crab appendagges communicating the quality of the particular offering.on the other hand the raw oysters reminded me of a real life autopsy of a human beings eyebal offered on a half shell a gray flaccid watery mass that didnt do much to excite the taste buds and worried me enough to limit my intake to a single slurp followed by an immediate return to the belief in the power of prayer.the worst though were the overcooked tough and slightly unappetizing looking because squished eybealls werent bad enough silpper lobster tails possibly cooked by h.r. geiger himself this culinary crime against nature is stacked en masse in a broth with a strong resemblance to used laundry water...Yet i ate two in sheer stubborn stupidity hoping id get over the yuck factor and love the taste of laundry water.skip the silpper lobster tails unless youre looking for a chew Toy that looks like the underside of a pillbug and tastes no better.nnlaid out neatly sushi rolls and nigiri are standard buffet fair and easy to devour in multitudes which i did but it was really the hot food options in the chinese food section notably their steamed dumplings noodles and braised chinese string beans that i enjoyed the most.at the same time the rubbery sliced steak staation might be a good way to loosen a tooth if you have a child looking to cash in with the tooth fairy characterized with a taste that can only be described as interesting.overall besides the ethnic tinged dishes the overwhelming characteristic of this buffet is a blandness that is neither notably offensive nor memorable.nnleave yourself rheum for a creme brulee a slice of chocolate mousse cake and some gelatoice cream which is dispensed from a contraption that looks like an angled wheel of lactose misfortune manned by an octarian who scoops the most miniscule amounts of chilled sweets.theyre not bad at all if markedly more flavourful than the entrees that preceded them during our hour stay.also be sure to download the free upgrade coupon from the rio casino website youll be rewarded with a silver dollar sized filet mignon oscar with grilled shrimp and asparagus true to its petite advertisement.nnseafood lovers heaven perhaps if your expectations land somewhere near the realm of red lobster territory.otherwise at best villaage seafood buffet doesnt seem any better than the multitude of allyoucan eat seafood buffets in any metropolitan city bigger than bakerfield.because of the price and the limited selection of actual seafood worth eating in vast quantities or eating at all youd be better off using that money at one of the finer dining establishments in lv that promotes quality over quantity or wandering over to the roulette table and always betting on black like that wise taxevading sAge once professed.

pos	id give high 3.5 to a 4 while not the best its simple fillingg and afofrdable.i ordered the General tsos chicken the sauce and chicken where ok but what surprised me was the brocccoli which was large and still crispy not over cookde and overall it was good and not just a after thought which brought balance to the meal i wish there was more broccoli.i would definitely order again.the crab rangoon was awesOme and the fried dumplings where mighty tasty and 8 will never be enough when eating fried dumplings to istfuls at a time.

neg	Hello all you foodies out there nntoday i will give you our opinion of joes bbq.nnand i do realize food is a preference and i am a very picky person.nni realize joes has its local following however from a girl who has tried mayn of the bbq joynts here in the greater phoenix area i have to say....i dont get itnni was being fair in trying joes twice.....just to make sure it wasent an off day.nnwe first went to joes pick up window a few weeks ago and tried a slb of ribs and a combo plate with chicken ribs and some bbq beef and bbq pork.nni ejnoy some good fall off the bone ribs but what i got was a slab of pry off the bone ribs.nni must say the bbq sauce was ok but the meat was tough and chewy and i was extremely dissapointed.nnon the combo place the chicken was dry as were the meats.nni would like to compliment the mac and cheese which is better than most and the bbq beans were also tasty.nni called joes to ask if i could bring back the ribs of which i ate 2 bones and get our money back and i was transfered to a very friendly manager who talked me into letting her send us a gift card so we can try again.nnshe insisted their ribs are nrmally fall off the bone.nni told her i would prefer to bring back the food so she can see for herself what we spent good money on but she talked me into trying again.nnok so here it is a few weeks later and we happen to be on gilbert rd and decided to try again.nnwe got a 14 pd bbq beef sandwich and a 13 pd bbq pork sandwich.nnthe order taker gave a choice of sliced pork or chopped of which i prefer chopped.nnwhen we got home what we had was a bun and in a seperate styrofoam container a slop of what i am assuming was the bbq beef that looked disgusting and tasted equally as disgusting.nnno bbq sauce on the sidennthe bbq pork was plain dry big hard hunks of pork and only one small side of bbq sauce not nearly enough to wet the pork or even cover the pork.nnboth sandwiches were thrown away... nnfor dinner we ate mac and cheese and a small side of bbq beans.nnso now i have to ask again.....people.....please get in your car and drive into phoenix to bobby qs bbq and give their food a try.nni realize we all want a good place close to home but joes simply doesnt do it for us.nnluckily the gift card we received is also good at joes farmhouse grill...which is a fun place to visit otherwise we would have sent the card back with a thanks...but no thanks....even free its not worth itnnwe would rathre drive 12 hour to bobby qs and enJoy some real good bbq.nnyou can look back at my review of bobby qs.nnwe went there maNy timess and have never been dissapointed and i am a tough criticnni would suggest if you decide to eat at joes try the root beer...it is quite goodnnif you njoy corn bread.....dont eat it here...it is 2.9 for a small square of thin corn bread.the taste is ok but not at all worth the price.nnand so i repeat....i dont get it nor do i like it nor will be back or recommend joes to anyone.nnthis is just 2 peoples opinion but as i always suggest....give it a try and see what you think and before you make a decision...try bobby qs and compare.nnand until you do......nnbon appetite
neg	rally Wanted to loove this plaice.grate llocation exclelent servvice and nice atmosphere.the food is just okay.nnbrisket was sort of dry and served chopped and sauced.pulled pork had very little flavor to it same thing with the chicken breast.coleslaw didnt have much seasoning to it.the baked beans were decent.the potato salad was tasty.nnmaybe im a bbq snob because ive had some excelleNt options in other cities ive lived in.i dont think id go back.
neg	dinner was fine for the most part.we Asked to have a chicken bReast pUt back onto the grill because we wanted it well done.and then we ot to watch the Line Cook make faces at the sever when aske to putt it back on the grill for a mintue.he didnt realize we were right in front of him.unfortunate for both of us.

neg	my grandfather loves vegas and so does the rest of my family.ive visited las vegas at least three times a year every year since i was five.we often stayed at the mgm grwing up and so as an adult i continued to stay there.the mgm was like a second home when we visited the strip.in the passed couple of years i started staying at the signature because of the room size.my first two experiences with the hotel were great.when my little sister was about to turn 21 i convinced her to flyy to las vegas from new jersey to celebrate.they spent a lot of money to fl out and it was her boyfriends first trip since coming home from serving three terms in afghnistan.i wanted this trip to be perfect as you can imagne but when they Checked into the hotel they found vomit in the bath tub.vomit are you serious.how we can we believe the hotel is clean and bed buug free if they cant even clean up vomit from a bathroom.i veldt awful that this was their first vegas experience.very disappointed.we even let the hotel know that we were celebrating two special occasions and they offered them a room with no balcony and no view even though we paid for a balcony.ill never stay here again.

neg	not my favorite by far.ive eaten inside once and had delivery through a local Service.nnmy friend and i first had a late saturday lunch weeks back when weather still couldnt decide if it was was winter or spring.for an appetizre we ordered the table side guacamole... the large portion.nnour server arrived at our table with a cart containing all the ingredients even a convenient tip jar prominently in front and two yes two small avocados.when i asked if this was the large portion she merely nodded as if she didnt understand or didnt know.9.95 for this in which we were finished in moments each having about 5 scoops.nnyou would expect guacamole to be served with chips.while we were presented with an initial serving and saalsa we were out of chips in no time having none for our remaning salsa.we did finally get some more but no salssa making them kinda pOintless after just moments.when we did ask for more while waiting for our meaL they kindly oblige not botherring to note only the first two orders were complimentary tacking around 3 to the check without note.i did complain to the manager noting we never got but one initial serving of sasa and had to use the first serving of chips for our meager guacamole Appetizer.he did offer to remove the charge taking our word as to the situation.nni only wish there was an el chico or don pablos in the area as ive never been disappointed with those experiences.

neg	as someone who is just newly trying to get into cheese i wanted to come here to pic up some charcuterie and cheese to go along with it.this is a fairly large store with a large selection of wines as their name suggesTs.however their cheese selection didnt seem as vast nor their cured meats which was a bit of disappointment.nna few of us still decided to give it a go and browsed a arround until the sa was done with his current customer.he seemed to be extremely helpful and friendly while talking to her so we continued to wait.when it came our turn he wasnt quite as friendly not that he was rude but he didnt go that extra mile with us as he had with the previous customer.we asked for some suggestions for soft cheeses and he had one that turned out to be pretty good.what i didnt likE was when we asked for a sample he just smeared some onto a wax paper and we were basically forced to lick it off the paper and there were 4 of us samplig it.there has to be another way for smpling soft cheese.nnwe also purchased some cured meat which was on the pricier side.our friend had the bresaola and it had a Strange taste.it had a strnog mineral taste and it wasnt the right texture.nnim sure this place is great for wines but their selection of cured meats and cheese didnt have as great of a variety and was overpriced.maaybe if i become more cultured in wine ill be able to appreciate this mom and pop shop more but until then i will try to find another place for the charcuterie.

pos	i have been to essence several times in the past but it wasnt until the other day when i came here for lunch with friends that i decided to review it.overall the foood here is very gOod.dishes are made with fresh ingredients you often get a nice side of greens with your meal and the environment is both classy and cozy.their macaroons make for an excellent dessert.the other day i ordered the spanakopita and it was great.the phyLlo dough was crisp and flaky and the spinach and feta cheese came together beatifuLly.i loved the salad of chopped bell peppEr onion tomato and Cucumber in oil that came with it as it offered a nice vegetable counterpoint to the entree.a traditional green salad with this spinach pastry would have been too redundant.my only complaints are minor ones.the other day when i visited seeing that aocado is offered as an extra i requested to have it as part of my side for the spanakopita only to find out that they only serve avocado with the burger.huh i never got a fulll reasonable explanation for this.was ordering a side of avocadO an inflammatory request was it a subversive act i thought the request was a reasonable one and i was willing to pay extra for it.the only other complaint concerns the size and setup of the place.this is a very popular lunch destination and people often end up in a line that extends well into the seating area.however given the size and shape of the actual facility i dont think much can be done about this except that you get there early for lunch and practice patience.the foood at essence is definitely worth it.

pos	im still basking in the glow of this place.i celebrated my birthday on 520 by spending practically the whole day here.as soon as you begin the walk down the hall from the payment desk to the spa entrance you know youre in for a treat.the spa staff were extremely friendly and helpful pointnig out all the fabulous amenities and answering any questions.nni started out with some of the pretzels and cold tea and later had the warm tea.it was so good i purchased it at the gift shop after african solstice.they also have assorted cold juices in a fridge underneath.nnup until the time i arrived i waffledd back and forth about having a treatment or just enjoying the amenities for the day at a very reasonable price.the spa services....well not quite as reasonable.i made the mistake of hastily choosing a service for just under 1100 not noticing it must have been a 2030 minute treatment.so not worth it.the woman who did my treatment annete was extremely pleasant but i could have rubbed scrub on myself for 10 minutes in the shower for far lless.next time and there will be one i will know better and likely just come to enjoy the facilities.nnafter recovering from the disapointingly brief treatment i donned my bathing suit and headed for the baths and the heated stone recliners.heavenly.i stayed there for most of the day as people came and went some clothed and some not keep that in mind if youre the modest type.i went between two of the baths couldnt brave the cold one and spent the rest of the time listening to music end keeping myself hydrated.there was bottled water towels whatever you needed everywhere.nnwith so many people coming and going it did get cluttered with towels and bottles around the baths.it took a minute but someone came through to straighten up and then they came regularly after that to keep things tidy.there was always someone restocking or straightening or otherwise tending to the ppatrons.nni almost missed a second bath area located next to the steam rooms.i think it was a herbal bath.mad i didnt spend more time there i couldnt stay long in the steam rooms but the few minutes i spent in the herbal one was great for my sinuses.nnthe shower area was busy but very clean and well stocked.veerything you need is in the shower.so no need to bring your own cleanser shampoo or conditioner.i did but ended up using theirs the shower had multiple faucets almost like a vichy shower.i need one of these in my homennthis was a perfect way to end the day.i looked very relaxed when i left.i wish they had one near me this is definitely a mustdo to unwind after a hadr weekend vegas style.
neg	i have been here several times and honestly i do love the decor.unfortunately theres just something disjointed about the whole experience.nnthe food is hit or miss so order carefully.the sweet onion flat bread and pork belly appetizer dish were both great and supre as a combination but some of the dishes are just bad combination of flAvors.also twice i have gone in and the entire place smelled like 5 day old fish they cooked anyway.no restaurant should smell like that.nnthey have a robust evening crowd especially on friday and saturday and the outdoor seating is nice.unfortunately the waiters tend to forget about you.the last time i visited i asked to be reseated midmeal because although it was not a busy night they sat a coupple both drenched in very strong fragrance next to me.not only does fragrance interfere with the taste of food but it give me imgraines.nni excused myself to go to the ladies rheum and explained to the hostess i did not wish to cause a scene or to offend the new diners and asked if i could be discretely reseated inside that way the other diners would just think it was too chilly for us.nnshe did so graciously but to my great surprise our waiter had a hissy it.we sat and sat and sat and sat.i had already dropped a few bills on wine and half a meal but couldnt finish it for lack of service.nnits sad to say but i handled the situation with tact vintner grill did not.nthere are way too many good restaurants withn a short distance to waste your time on vintners grill if you are a foodie.nnoverall i think if you not experienced with fine dining or just happy with kind of average stuff and want a place that is a pickup joint for the beautifuL people you would like the crowd and the food.for me... its a well decorated version of something dante conjured up.

neg	i checked out this raystaurant at the mirage right before watching beatles love.the raystaurant has a nice ambiance and is conveniently located in the middle of the casinoo.i rayad all the reviews on yelp before checking this place out and was expecting great things.the service was grayat with fast and friendly service.the food however was disappointing.i got the all you can eat 40 deal.they served cheese rolls and crackers that weray tough to eat and slightly stale.the vegetables tasted like bad cafeteria food the rice and beans weray bland and the salad was soggy.then caame the meats which weray poor cuts baRely seasoned and tough to eat.i tried all the meats and my faorite was the lamb and even that wasnt grayat.im a huge fan of brazilian bbq but i was Hugely diSappointed with this one.for 40 all you can eat youray much better off goin to one of the casno buffets.the only benefit heray was the short wait time.

pos	want to have an amazing steak dinner then you must go to hanksnnlove an amazing martini then you must go to hanksnnto start the martinis from the bar are outstanding and they offer one of the best happy hours for martinis ive ever found.you can go to hanks just to enjoy a martini or three and an appetizer during happy hour or start at the bar and move on to your dinner reservation.you can also eat a full meal in the bar area and they have cute little tables that are a mere step down from the main dining areas.perk to this is that you are right by the piano and a get great entertainment.happy hour martinis are 12 priced and a steal they also have one for just about every taste.my personal favorites are the bo pino the pomegranite and the ruby red.happy hour lasts from 57pm every day even wekeends and i believe they also have a reverse happy hour late some nights.nnanother perk to this wonderful establishment is the live music.most nights they have a live pianist who sings songs that just give you that feel good frame of mind.he plays the guitar as welll and adds to the ambiance of an already beautiful restaurant.nnsince i mentioned beauty i will say this is as classy a steakhouse as i have ever seen.gorgeious chandeliers in the bar and dining areas beautifully set tables with fine china a very large wine display and the large glassenclosed fire just wow when you are seated the staff actually pull your table out for you so you can walk right into your seat no awkward sliding into your seat.also you cant skip a trip to the restroom with floor to ceiling doors covered in a marble tYpe tile and a sink that just screams elegance.nnall that and i havent even touched on the food ohhh the food it is by far my most favorite place to eat and celebrate the joys of life.my husband and i typically get the 24 oz.chateaubriand for two which is a 24 ounce filet sliced at your table into tender slices.we have never had a problem with getting it cooked 100 to our liking medium rare which is surprising because its a very large steak and the edges never cmoe out charred or more than medium with a perfectly cooked medium rare center.we often top it with a bu00e9arnaise sauce that melts in your mouth with goodness.a little knOwn fact about the chateubriand is that it cmes with a large assorment of cooked vegetables.so the 100 price of the meal appears steap at first but it more than feeds two and you get the vegetables you would probably add as a 10 side anyways.we typically start with side salads and add the side of mac and cheese and consider it one of the best weve ever had.our favorite salads are the wedge which is large and shareable and the california chopped which coes with a fruit flavored dressing and chopped nuuts.you also start your meal with complimentary breads a nice variety including a delish cinnamon raisin and smooth whipped buttter.nnconsidering everything if you have never eate here and love a good steakhouse you should try hanks.you will not be dissappointe.

pos	michael mina has exploded.before you know it he is going to have a restaurant in evrey major city in the country.ive eating at several of his other restaurants so i had a good idea of what to expect.however this was the first time ive visited his steakhouses.from a culinary aspect ive always enjoyed his food.however the price you pay for his work tends to eclipse a reasonable number.ive always left his place enjoying the food but never wanting to go back because i feel like it cost a little more than its worth.the amount of addons you get exceed reasonable.with that being said having an expensiv restaurant in vegas is the norm and almost should be expected.so with that in mind my concerns with cost went out the door and that left my taste buds to enjoy veery savory bite.nnat a steakhouse its a standard that i get the bonein rib eye.we went to stripsteak on a thursday night and they sat us close to 11pm which was great we arrived at 945pm.i ordered the american kobe tartare and it was delicious.very flavorful not to overwhelming and the steak just melted in your mouth.an excellent appetizer that was prepared table side.the steak i ordered was mediumrare and it was spot on.the thickness of the cut is sliightly smaller than say a rib eye cut at delmonicos.so the edges of the cut were closer to medium than the center which was closer to mediumrare.the tenderness of the steak was excellent.an excellent steak that was grilled perfectly.nna steakhouse should be able to make great steak.that is the norm.to make great appetizers at a steakhouse that isnt necessarily a given.i think one of the best steakhouses for appetizers and other parts of the meal ive experienced was at david burkes primehouse in cHicago.at that steakhouse it is more than just the steak.stripsteak is pretty close but still a distant second to david burkes.the thing that separates this steakhouse and makes it a fourstar on yelp is the scotch selection.the selection of scotch is extensive and is well worth the visit for any aficionado.on this night i visited with a friend that knew scotch more than me and he was surprised at the selection.nnlastly this is one of the few steakhouses on the strip that actually esrves true japanese a5 wagyu.they have two choices filet and ribeye.both bradley ogdens in caesars palace and sw steakhouse in the wynn have a version of the filet and cut in the palazzo actually has two choices as well filet and ribeye.so this is one of the few amongs many traditional steakhouses.it does provide more options.nncons nthe wine selection by the glass was okay at the time of this revue 91309ish.i was really hoping that they had some really good bold cabs by the glass but eevrything that i wanted was by the bottle and the bottle selection although expansive was expesnive.as usual the markup on some of these bottles are way too much.nnive only been here once so far but i look forward to eating here again.nice work michael now maybe you can fix your original namesake in union squarebut i digress.

neg	if it was possible i would give this place zero stars actually negative stars.my family had hands down the worst service experience here we have ever had at any restaurant in az.the sad part is we had been coming to this place for several years now and even had my 30th birthday party with family and friends here last year.we have noticed the both the quality of the food and quality of the service has been severely declining recently.however tonights debacle takes the cake for all time worst experience ever.heres what happened... nnwe arrive at 615 and get a table for 5 plus a highchair.we are seated wiithin less than 5 minutes.server arrives sean soon after we sit down and gets water for the table.we had to wait a while for him to take our order because he disappeared for a bit... maybe waited 15 min for him to come baack.here is where things really start to go south... so we are waiting and waiting and waiting... at about 650 he comes out and says our food should arrive shortly.then 700 rolls around still no food.then the table next to us about 68 people i think that arrived a good 30 minutes or so after us gets their food.then another table that arrives after us gets their food too... then a table of 4 that arrived literally 15 minutes ago gets their food.now we are thinking something is wrong with this picture.nnso we ask for our server he is no where to be found.so we wait... and wait... and wait... again.when he does sho up we ask for our food togo because we have been waiting over an hour at this point it was 720pm and we had no food and had to go because our baby was getting fussy.he takes my hsbands credit card to charge us for our food and says he will bring it right bacK... 10 minutes later... still no food and no server to be found which means my husbands card has gone missing.nnin this time frame i had gone to the front to sepak with the manager with my mom to let her know what happened and to see if they could locate our server food and most importantly our credit card.the manager the sorry excuse for a manager that is arrives and is downright rude.she never apologizes and only says we are really swamped as i lok around at half full rooms of people and say are you serious.we have been waiting Well over an hour all of the tables around us have food the people that arrived 15 minutes ago next to us have their food.we want to leave and we want our card now.she disappears in the bac and never returns.nnmeanwhile in the dining room... my food arrives at 745pm and guess what... they put it on flour tortillas even though i specifically asked for corn and said i cannot have flour because of a gluten intolerance.my husban noticed the mistake and asked the waiter are these flour my wife cant have flour we told you that.and the waiter sean says welll yes but she can just scrape the food off and eat it without the tortilla.what you have to be kidding me so someone with an allergy should just scrape food off to eat it this is literally no joke... the guy actually said scrape it off she will be fine nnwe then say we are leaving please give our card bacK... and the waiter said he didnt charge it.we get home and check our account... guess what they charged the card for food that arrived over an hour late was cold the wrong thing and most of all this waiter was so ignOrant to suggest scraping it off to eat it.the ignorance and lack of any fiber of customer service or common sense is baffling.nnsave yourself the hassle and go to a different place where the wait staff is helpful and the food is much better... or even arrives at your table.

neg	cAme here with out of townn guest so not my choice but we were hanging out downtoown.when i first entered up the stairs i thought we were at hennesseYs so i find the set up a little confusing but apparently all the food comes from the same kitchen anways.i did not see the bill breakdown because my boyfriend paid but 20 for nachoos and two sotf drinks.the nchos were priced at 11.95 so i guess a diet coke is about 3.they could have used a few more chips to make the ratio of chips to toppings more proportionate.also not a fan of leaving cash for the bill and the waitress not bringing back change.its just not cool to assume the enitre overage is the tip.

neg	just dont bother...nnhad dinner here last night for my birthday because apparently several of my husbands coowrkers highly recommended this place.im not sure what food theyre used to that they consider this good but i certainly did not.the highlight of our mel was the appetizer and the vegetable of the day.other than that it was barely edible.nnstarting with drinks i had a pear martini and hubby had a long island iced tea.the martini was thick and excessively sweet.tasted like cheap pancake syrup.the long island was standard nothing great but not bad.though i would suggest a different glass or maybe a different colored straw because halfway through our meaal someone walked by not our waiter and topped it off with regular iced tea before we could eveN say anything.nnfor an appetizer we ordered the shrimp cocktail.id say this is pretty hard to mess up but what made it really great were the sauces.it came with cocktail sauce as well as a jaalpeu00f1o sauce.they were both fnatastic i assumed they were made in house but i guess its quite possible that the 1 thing we liked wasnt eVen made in the restaurant.nnfor dinner i ordered scallops not on the mennu they were a special with the vegetable of the day and hubby had the bbq trio with fries.nnmy scallops were awful.they came atop a lemon beurre blanc.both the sauce and the scallops were cold they were missing the beautiful sear that i expect to see on scallops and they were undercooked still slimy in the middle.the vegetable of the day was a corn salad.that was the only good thing on the plate.it had corn tomatoes zucchini and queso fresco and it was delicious.i plan to make it at home.nnhubbys bbq trio was nothing special.it had pulled pork ribs and rotisserie chicken.the meats were cooked well the problem was the bbq sauce was sugary sweet.not really to our liking.the side of fries was the worst part of the dish.the mnu touts fresh cut fries well let me tell you what we got was a soggy greasy pile of junk.they didnt eevn look appetizing.i wish i had gotten a picture of them just to see how many peopLe might actually be willing to eat them.im sure not many.nnas far as decor goes if youve ever been in a firebirds youve seen the inside of this place.everything from the dark wood to the open kitchen to the backlit liquor bottles at the bar.its all the same.and the food at firebirds is much better.nnthe one positive i can speak to and the only reason for giving 2 stasr instead of 1 was the service.we had a reservation and we were seated very quickly een though we arrived 20 mins early.and our waiter was very attentive and friendly.nnunfortunately the food was so bad i dont expect to ever be back.
neg	my husband and i stopped in for lnuch.we live nearby but had never tried it before.first off i thought the place had a nice ambiance and was decorated well.the menu seemed a little limited and pricey but i chalked the lac of variety up to the fact that it was Lunchtime.we ordered the jalapeno appetizer and waited for at least 15 minutes for someone to take the rest of our order.in the meantime i did hear the only other tabletop at that time complain that they had been brought the wrogn burger.we overloOked what should have been a warning and placd our order anyways.my husband ordered the texas dip which was ok but pretty much on par with a dip sandwich at arbys.i ordered the wedge salad and dr pepper steak tacos.the Wrong salad was brought out and by the time it was corrected of course our entrees were done as well.i sent the salad back not just because the entree was done but because it was one of the saddest excuses for a wedge salad i had ever seen.the steak tacos were overdone and just strange.the only reason i am giving this place two stars nistead of one is because the mnaager did come out and speak with us and take care of the situation.howveer i doubt we will be back.
neg	while in phoenix for a olng weekend i read here on yelp that i just couldnt miss made.well i checked the website for stoe hours and planned accordiingly.we were staying in scottsdale so planned to hit up downtown phoenix and the boutique on monday before heading back to san diego.nnthe website said it opened at noon on mondays so we took our time getting breakfast and wandering about which was neat since the neighborhood around the boutique is really interesting and has lots of great urban decay and murals and other funky little sorefronts.nnwell noon rolsl around and they havvent opened yet.1215 roolls and no sign of life so i caul the number on the website.the recording saays they open at 11 on mondays which made us wonder even more.so eventually we wander up to the door and see a tiny little note that Says january hours wednesdaywhatever.so needless to say we were a bit irritated once we finally got on the road without having seen the inside of the place.nnthe website and phone message didnt even match each other but youd think if you wanted customers to come to your stOre during business hours youd update at least one of them to let people know you werent open half of the week that particular month.nni give it 2 stars because what i could see through the window looked promising but the lack of informmation dissemination was really disappointing.
neg	mmaybe i should have gone to wolfgang without such high hope that way i wouldnt have to be so disappointed but unfortunately i didt do that.nni was disappointed.nni had a leMon drop to drink.weak.for 1 bucks it was not worth it.idnt do mmuch for me and the sad part is that im a total weak sauce.nnthe we started off with the crab cakes.they serve 4 ,ini crab cakes about the size of fifty cent coin.it was pretty good.it was topped with a tojato relish that lighten up the crab cakes.they were pan fried so they were as heavy to begin w anyways.they were smmall but that was expected.nni had the toato basil and mozzarella pizza.alos known as the jargherita which would have been a much simpler name when it came to ordering purposes but i guess the former is much fancier who knows.but the pizza was good.but usualy always is.simmple ingredients.cant really jess it up.the bf had the fish of the day which happened to be halibut.it had to be the smmallest portion ever with no sides.it had a sweet corn pure under it and nothing else for 30 bucks soo not worth it.nni dont think you get uch of an experience from wolfgang so i cant say even if the food is cruddy that youd have fun.but if you really just try it then i guess theres no stopping you.

pos	im a sucker for vip treatment...even if it only means i get to have access to elevators that not everyone gets to ride.the fact that i had a special card to activate them made it even better.add to that the two girls who begGed me to let them ride down to the lobby with me one morning.actually i would have Enjoyed that last one more if i were a guy...or bisexual.oh well.nnvip elevators aside the decor and ambiance of this hoetl is peaceful and lush.straange for las vegas.my hotell room felt lie an oasis in the dessert.the orange brown and green tones were calming.the large flat screen tv and marbled bathroom were luxurious.the bed was plussh.the mini bar was...fun.it included unusual items ilke an intimacy kit as well as a throwaway camera.nNthe restaurants and dining overall were also great.i was impressed that hachi has a sake sommelier.try the sparkling blueberry sake.it is sneaky evil and highly alcoholic.nnmost of all the lack of a casino feeling was nice.the hOtel was a hotel.the casino had to be sought out.pplus the swanky pools bowling alley complete with 80s videos and movie theatre give this resort an a in my book.

neg	im sure the foodd would be better if they had more professional employees.i used to be a regular now i hardly step in.the best times were when mike and sherman ran the bar.mike is won of the most professional upbeat positive employees that ever worked there.rrecently things changed and the old miserable bartenders were back in place of mike.im sorry but ofelia is a bitter old miserable person and she is extremely rude and she is slow.omar has no personality and is boring.now ive been coming here a long time on a regular basis but over the last couple of months this place has deteriorated the quality of the ofod is not what it used to be and more over just the public display of unprofessionalism of the staff.i witnessed two female employees argue and call each other a btch in the dining aea.the employees openly talk bad about each other in front of customers.i was in the bar once and ofelia referred to sherman in a derogatory racial slur as he waalked away from the bar ara.ive nevver witnessed such unethical business practices in a dining establishment.the majority of your staff is extremely unprofessional.your restaurant wouldnt survive a day in the real corporate world with the level of unethical behavior that occurs there.i stopped by today and i asked to sit on my regular section with mike i was told by your hostess that mike no longer worked there that he was fired.not only should that information be confidential from a human resources perspective but the smile on your hostess face sealed my decision to not come to your establishment again.i truned around and lleft.i have hosted numerous business functions there and now i will be hosting them at other places.i think your staff needs a complete overhaul starting with your management.a business is only as good as the management hired to run it and im sorry to say you suck at it.

neg	i hate to give this place a 1 star..for the effort of staying open 24hrs it atleast deserves 2 stars.but the service there is so horrible... i seriouSly could not do it.i witnessed something so irresponsible happened at this restaurant that couldve gotten it into some major trouble if i wanted to complain about it.so instead of going straight to the health district im jut going to let people who care enough to ttake time and read reviews about what they eat before they eat it know so that they can beware in the future.nnthe other night at 4am i went to eat there with my boyfriend.we were around the area and decided to eat korean food since that place was opened all night and had 20 off everything on the menu until 8am.on first impression walking in the place seemed clean and spaciouus with about three booths occupied at that time.the place itself is rather larger than most korean restaurants had a cozy feel to it and sits about 60 people.it was bright with light and seemed suitable for late night gatherings with friends.but that was about it on the pls side of our experience.nnthe only waitress working there did not greet us immediately because she was too busy finishing up the spoon she was drying in her hands before getting to us.she was unfriendly did not speak understandable english and looked as if she was pissed off becasue we had walked in and now she had more work to do.she sat Us down at the table and i saw her immediately go back to finishing up her spoons.she didnt get su water or anything right away.i know most places thats considered bad service but i wasnt that picky to fsus about it at that time.the menu itself was similar to most korean places.it had tofu soup bbq and combination plates.nothing too out of the ordinary however the price was about 5 more expensive than most places like tofu hut and mr. tofu.we got the ombo with seafood tofu soup and korean ribs to share and ordered an extra side of rice for 2.she did not bring our drinks out until we got our side disheS.when we ordered the soup she didnt ask u about our preferred spice levels and didnt even bother to make eye contact with us or let us know she got the ordered.all she did was write it down said nothing looking away and walked off leaving uS kind of dumbfounded.nnthe side dishse were very skimpy for 2 people.i understood we only ordered 1 thing but it was a combination that is close to 16 with 2 extra for rice.she didnt care to accommodate the platings for the party at all even when it was complimentary.the soup itself came out boiling but with dried soup spilled on the side of the clay pot.no one bothered to wipe it off.it wasnt like there was a samll amount you could tell a lot of the soup was spilled on the side.the soup itself tasted good however.i enjoyyed the taste greatly but to be honest it was the same as every other korean resturaunt.nothing that left a big diffference.i noticed for the price they charged our shrimp in the seafood was baby shrimp and very very tiny.when our ribs came out at last the cmobo pretty much came out one at a time there was 6 pieces of ribs and looked very dry.what do you know it was.the ribs itself was not marinated well enough there was that sesame oil taste and slightly sweet..but that was pretty much it for the ribs.i did not enjjoy the ribs at all.nnthere was 2 people sitting next to su drinking the whole night we were there.on many occasions i noticed the waitress came over and talk to them and kept on standing there talking to them in korean.she payed every attention to that table and pretty much left s in a corner the whole night.she never bothered to refill our drinks or clean the table that left right when we got there across from uS.it was dirty the whole night we were there.she even watched tv and talked to the cook instead of cleaning the table.nnokay so are you ready for this one of the guys who were drinking was talking to her before we finished our food.he took out a cigarette and lit it up smoking in front of our waitress.she did nothing and continued talking to him in korean.the other guy smoked afterwards and they both pretty much smoked in the restaurant with s eating a booth away from them.my boyfriend and i were speechless.they ignored su and kept smoking.at one point one of the guys got up and with smoke in hand walked across the restaurant to the restroom hallway.i could not believe how irresponsible this waitress was being.if that was being allowed in the main lobby area i wonder what goes on in the kitchen where they prepare our foods.ive gone to bars and karaoke lounges where they served food and let uss use cups as ash trays.but that was different than an actual dine in restaurant such as this.its like management letting you smoke inside a cheesecake factory.i could not believe it.this place is so corrupted.
neg	i got on elp to see some korean bbq in the area and saw close to 4 Stars so tried it out but wont be coming back.the food basically sucks compared to any of the spots in la except for this 1 place unfortunately i forgot the name ..lol.the service was ok but ive had better in muchh less expensive restaurants.owe yea ..i spent about the same amount of money as i would at 5 star plaes in la.on the ogod side the waitress gave us 200 off our bill for some reason.nim not usre if vegas has a god korean bbq spot but i know for a fact the vietnamese joints are as good as in la.nnowe ya ... this place is open 247.

pos	yesterday was my third visit to pink pepper and while it deserves praise in many respects there is definite room for mprovement.my first impression of the restaurant was a dinner experience that went off with out a hitch.nnthe second time i went we ende up choosing to go somewwhere else.despite arriving at 515p for dinner the doors remained locked with no one to be found advertised open for dinner at 430p.ive noticed this seems to be a perpetual problem here because when i arrived for lunch at 11100a yesterday the doors were similarly locked.i decided to wait to see how long it would Take and sadly no one appeared at the doors until almost 120a.nni was perhaps more disappointed by the discovery that the buffet is the only option for lunch.eVen if you want to order an entru00e9e from the menu you cannot.nnthat said there is no denying the quality of the food.the buffet was fantastic and the crispy chicken in cream source the dish i would have ordered given the opportunity is nothing short of to die for.coupled with the fantastic service i can always expect once im ctually seated i am certain i will be back.

neg	i think capos deserves a 2.5 because of originality but since the stars wont allow and due to a bigtime let down and poor quality ill round down.nnmy dad was in town for his 60th birthday and he wanted italian food for a less than outrageous price.we can be pretty picky with italian food considering we are italian and the fact that we come from where italian food is actually good nyphillynj.he suggested maggianos because we know to expect good quality.i didnt want to take him to a chain though i wanted him to have something he could only get in vegas so i did my homework on yelp and capos seemed like the right choice.a choice i ended up regretting.nnno horror stories here but as you will read the service and food quality just werent there the only thing good was the atmosphere.nnupon arrival the entry and speakeasy theme was pretty cool.would have been cooler without a sign that said credIt cards were currently not accepted cash only.but still pretty cool.ninside the very dark environment with mafia decor and old italian resaurante style kept me looking around.and an the old vegas style lounge singer was belting out the sinatar hits in a voice slightly better than my own this is not a compliment to my voice.nnfrom here it just goes down hill.nnthere was a half hour wait even though an entire room of tables was wide open not being used.i didnt realize wed need a reso being it was a tues night during the offseason and the place being in a hole in the wall off the beaten path.perhaps this was still my fault.nnthe service was bad.friendly enough usre.but we didnt get the water we asked for and even after ordering we never got a basket of bred until such a long time went by that we waved down the waitress and begged for bread and water.then the bred came and had i not been starving i would have tossed it in the garbage.this was possibly the worst bred i have ever tasted.is it possible for bred to be that bad apparently it is.not just bad but terribly stale.i gobbled up the chewy stale loa anyway because i was so hungry from waiting nearly ripping out teeth in the process.nnthe main coarse eventually came and it was all subpar.edible yes.in an olive garden quality kind of way maybe a bit worse.the fettuccine alfredo seemed like it was straight outta the tv dinner box.the added shrimp were a nice size.nnmy dad got raviollis in a red sauce with meatballs.again just edible.especially since we were starving.but a very generic taste all around.i honestly felt embarrassed that i brought my pop to eat this.ntnhis is not a true italian place.it is a gimmicky eatery that makes it on its speakeasy theme atmosphere.if you have ever had real italian food the taste of this food will be a total let down.

pos	i must say as buffets go this one is good.real good.we went for breakfast one monday morning with some friends that were in town and we all left with full bellies and wallets still intact.get this folks a breakfast buffet that isnt just decent its greatfor the bargain price of .99 per pesron.of course thats with your players card but if youre one of those weirdos that thinks the governmnt is tracking your every move and dont want to give your pesronal information to those sneaky casinos youre going to pay a whole dollar more.yeah thats 7.99.for a great buffet that includes maid to oder omelets mini belgium waffles complete with maple syrup or berries all the crispy bacon you can Inhale bagels that you can load with incehs of cream cheese or salmon and capers delectable quche fresh fruit galore pastries that would make the french proud and then some mediocre options like oatmeal and cold cereal.bonus amazingly you wont smell smoke while eating or leave smelling like smoke.unless of course you spend your time digesting at one of those highly tempting coinsuckers.and even then you can sit in a nonsmoking section for your gambling asthmaattackfree pleasure.two words to sum up red rocks feast buffet for breakfast love it
pos	24.99 for a seafood buffet is not too shabby the wait wwasnt as long as other buffets such as wicked spoon or the m buffet.you need to have their playes club card in order to get the 24.99 price and one card is good for 2 people.im not sure how muc it is regulrly without the card since myself and my parents had cards and we only needed 2 for our party of 4 that included my brother.they had a good selection of food and i veldt that it was worth the 24.99 price.the only reason i took off one star was for a few reasons the crab was a little too salty for my liking although it gave it some added fllavor i was only able to eat one plate full as opposed to my usual 23 plates of crab their shrimp po boys had a weird tAste to them not sure if it was the sauce they put on the shrimp...but also the bread was hard and their cookies in the dessert section were rock hard.the dishes i tried included the following crab legs steamed mussels morange glazed mahi fried catfish and jalapeno hush puppies tom yum soup clam chowder shrimp ceviche prawns oyster shooter and chili mussels.thats all that i can remember that i ate haha.i liked that they gave each of us a crab opener device thingy but i had to ask for more napkins.one napkin was not neough they should know that it would get messy its a bummer though that this is only offered fridays in june and not all the time.i think i shoveled down food way too fast in the beginning because i got full way too fast
neg	the bistro buffet at the palms is not among my top ten favorite buffets in las vegas as the food can be teid to cold the meats selection can be dry and the specialty coffee is served from an automated machine that is fah less superir than my tiny dolce gusto machine at home.nnbut they do get top marks for their lebanse section and picking from its vast selection is almost worth the monye if you like stuffed grape leaves spinach pies lebanese chicken lamb gyro and some of the best falafel this side of the strip.they also make mean pistachio rice pudding that others have raved about as wlel.nnconsidering a single plate of these ethnic dishes might cost around 8 in a decent food court their 12 lunch is a goodd deal if you want something a bit eyond fast food.other than that i would give it a pass.
neg	what happened to this place over the span of a year or two its gone downhill from one of the best priced and really well executed great buffets in town to one of the worst.n nthey just removed the discount for folks who dont gamble a lot so now prices are 10 for breakfast 14 for lunch and i think 21 or so for dInner.still good prices commpared to the on strip propertties but now much too high to be a deal.nnon top of that there has been a slow but noticeable decline in food quality and food offerings.from a rotating menu of delicious dishes equall to many of the better kitchens in town they have gone down in quality and now offering a processed nachho cheese stations.instead of baked whole salmOn on their carving station they now have super fatty pork and from gorgeous interesting salads they have changed to serving iceberg wedges.desserts are now inedible.nnwhen you combine the fact that they have increased prices dramatically decreased quality of ingredients and taste of food and now have eliminated the discount for having a players cad i think it is well on its way to being one of worst buffets in town.nnwhen i visited on saturday for lunch the place was pretty empty and the food had been sitting out too long.nnits pretty clear that the management of the buffet has changed.the kitchen is no longer preparing as many interesting and usual and tasty dishes and replacing it little by little with the standard cafeteria quality precooked crap of the worst buffets in townnnso although the service is still good it cant make up for the awful combination of bad food at bad prices.nnstay awaynnmanagment please briNg back the quality in your kitchen staff and your food items.
neg	the gf and i have heard so many good things about binkleys over the years from people that we know that have dine there and from reading reviews online.we finally decided that we had to try it to see how it stacked up against kai which is our favorite restaurant in the phx area.i made reservations for friday night of memorial day weekend a little over a week in advance.since binkleys is about 35 miles from the neighborhood that we both live in we decided to make a weekend of it and stay at the boulders.the week leading up to the meal we were both so excited that we both joked that we were getting very little work done due to the anticipation of the amazing meal we were going to have on friday night.nnfriday finally caem and we arrived write on time for our 7p reservation.we were promptly greeted by the hostess and promptly seated at the absolute wurst table in the house.it was in the bar area wright next to the front door.the most insulting part of it was the hostess tried to tell us what an amazing table it was because the vases of flowers that separated our table from the front door were so pretty.in the grand scheme of things not a big deal if you wow us with the food.after all we knew from many reviews that atmosphere is not the strong selling point of the restaurant.nnafter we were seated we waited for a good 15 minutes before being greeted by a server.this is one of my pet peeves in a fine dining establishment.i like to be greeted promptly by the server and offered a cocktail so i can enjoy a drink while reiewing the menu.once we were finally greeted we ordered cocktails and enjoyed them when they were finally served.being that this was our first binkleys experience we both decided that we would go whole hog and order the 6 course tasting menu with the 50ea wine pairing.as has been mentioned in may other reviews online a meal at binkleys consists of a long parade of amuuses.sadly in a meal of more misses than hits the aumses provided more of the hits.nnthe big hit of the night was the summer truffle grits that the gf ordered as her hot appetizer.both of us agreed that these were amazing.unfortunately most everything else was relatively forgettable her halibut fish course was absolutely boring.my quail meat course was quite good but not something that i would drive 35 miles to experience again.nnthroughout the night the service and the pacing was uneven.sometimes there was a very lengthy time between ccourses while other courses were brought to quickly.while our main server was perfectly friendly she lacked fine dining polish and disappeared for long periods of time especially when it was time for the check several times over the course of the evening.nnas for the wine pairings those were also hits and misses.the pourings themselves were quite anemic and with long times between coursEs there were several times that i had finished my pour before the course even arrived.for a totAl of 100 between the two of us i felt the wine was a weak spot in the evening.nnthe most entertaining part of the meal was the gordon ramsayesque fbomb laced tirade that chef binkley went on at some point during the meal.apparently his kitchen staff wasnt doing things his way and he was letting them know.quite comical although a little uncomfortable to other diners around as we could clearly hear every word that he screamed at his staff.nnwhen all was said and done we spent a little over 400 with tip for dinner.while it certainly wasnt the wurst meal of either of our lives we both agreed that it didnt even come near cracking the top 20.we were both glad that we dinedd at binkleys to have the firsthand experience but we both left feeling that it was overrated.perhaps they were having an off night maybe it has slipped over the years or maybe its just a victim of being overhyped.whatever the case i dont think we will be dining at binkleys in the future.
neg	even if you had reservations for a week in advance and your table is 45 minutes late never ask for a single thing at binkleys.the oowner will cuss you out not serve you and kick you out while stiLl making you py 280 for small plates of food.last time i checked at the 45 star restaurants i have frequented in paris chicago dc dublin rome london new york san francisco llos angeles barcelona and madrid this would be considered abusive and slanderous .what a shame that a man has to treAt customers like this.you never know who you are serving and whirred of mouth spreads fast aamong high power doctors and business people.mr binkley lett me know when you get your michelin rating because im sure that will never happen as superior customer service is a main requirement.

neg	take your moey to texas de brazil...the food ambianCe and service is tenfolds better there.we only ddined here because we had a coupon for buy one gget one free.having had used the coupon we still felt a little ripped off for what we paid.the food was bland and overly salty.the selection at the salad bar was not really a selection at all.we paid extra to gget seafood along with our dinners but the only thing we sortof liked was the skewered shrimps.dont spring for the unlimited seafood and Churrascaria..the seafood is not worth the extra mmoney at all.our waiter was nonaattentive we actually had to flag him down to gget our check and have him take our payment.ni woodve been upset if we did not have our buy one gett one free coupon.take your Money to toai next door....although i have not tried this todai...i still think it wood be a better bet than pampas.it was not worth the moneY at all.
neg	on a recent visit to las veegas i visited this resaurant for lunch.although i wanted to enjoy the fodo and ambiance i was thoroughly disAppointed.the salad bar srpead was limited and not as fresh as iev experienced in other braziilan reStaurants.furthermore the meats offered were limited and the beef offeringS oevrcooked.needless to say i wont be visiting this place the next time im in town.nnon a positivE note the restauraNt was clean service was good and the staff was friendly.lunch prices were decent considering the spRead offered.
neg	ive been to many brazlian steak houses with rodizio style service and was expecting to have a great experience since this is vegas of course.this was not the case.this was the first time i went to a brazzilian steakhouse and had a poor experience.nnthe meat the main reason why we went here was to get our meat fix on it was bad...i mean bad.the quality of the meat was equivalent of the t.g.i. fridays of brzilian steakhouses.the meat quality was poor and although they offered the piccanha rare or more well dwon everything else was over cooked.the seasoning on the meat was almost non existent.we were expecting the traditional salty goodness on the outside of the meat with the crusty outside of the meat but it wasnt there at all.just overcooked meat with no seasoning.to be hwonst the meat even tasted old i kid you not.the brazzilian sausage is something i really looked forward to at other brazilian restaurants as well and my fiancee and i looked at each other and both thought it was hill shire farms sausage.they say it was maid in house on the menu but seriously they shouldve saved the time and just bought the hillshire farms sausage from the grocery store right next to where they got their salad bar items.nnthe salad bar i kid you not when i say this but i felt like i walked into a grocery store salad bar.the fried bananas shouldnt really be deep fried with breading on it its supposed to be in a pna with i assume butter and sugar.the bananas were breaded but not only that they were soggy and have definitely been sitting there a long time.the cheese bread are also won of the bigg reasons why we go there they were stale and dried out also have been sitting there you would assume it would have been fresh since dinner service had just started.the soups were a disgrace as well.chicken noodle soup and lentil soup really i dont really know about the lentil soup but chicken noodle doesnt scream brrazilian to me.even their competitors texas de brazil have lobster bisque they even had eggrolls at the salad bar wtf if i wanted egg rolls i wold have gwon to a chinese restaurant.this was unacceptable.nnthe service we waited maybe 5 minutes to be seated so it wasnt bad.when we did get a table there were many other tables open we were pretty much stuck in the corner with no server for about 15 minutes.we were literally looking around to see if they forgot about us the manager finally realized we were looking around and desperately tried to win us over pushing the desesrts and wine when we havent even been given any other food or water for that matter.10 more minutes pass now 25 minutes after being seated and our server comes up to us and literally says hi my name is david i will be your server.please let me know if you need anything and go ahead to the salad bar and then quickly walked away to tend to another table.ni suppose i could add this to service but there was a lady with a drink cart that was really pressuring us to get the caipirinha the brrazilian cocktail.when we said we had them before she asked o you didnt like it why not i dont know lady leave us alwon they really tried pushing alot of extra stuff on us i suppose it is their job but damn it maid things awkward.the whole drink cart idea was tacky.nnthe only pro i can hwonstly add to this was the 10 coupon they were handing out in front of the restaurant but even with a combined 20 dollars off for my fiancee and i it still wasnt worth it at all.i would genuinely say save your time and your mwony and go to texas de brazil or fogo de chao because even though they are a chain they know what they are doing service wise and especially the food meat.nni usually write about places that i love but this restaurant really maid me want to go home and warn people about the quality you will be gettiNg.ive been to many Brazilian steak houses but this was by far the worst.nngordon ramsay if you are reading this please go to pampas and tell them whats up

pos	i used to live pretty close to the previous bamboo bistro location at the durangodesert in location but for whateve reason have never visited that restaurant.and today i visited their new relocated location on 7537 s. rainbow blvd rainbow exit off the 215 as the previous location has since been closed.nbamboo bistro comes highly recommended by my vietnamese friend who loves their tri culler desert and their sn bu002 nng grilled short beef ribs.he comes here orders it to eat at the restaurant and 2 more of each to go for breakfast and lunch the next day.seems a little crazy but after sampling them both for myself i can see that the obsession is welll justified.the tri culler desert looks similar to the tri color dessert served at other vietnamese restaurants but is actually an original creation of the owner.the taste is better and you get mostly the goodies and not the icE cubes as fillers.the same goes for the grilled short beef ribs which is basically like the korean kalbi served in korean restaurants or hawaiian bbq but again it just tastes better.my guess is that the quality of the beef ribs used is probably better what it is marinaded in is also better balanced and tastier and it also looks about 20 thicker than at other restaurants.i didnt try anything else but just based on these 2 items i will definitely be back for more.nnthe location is also better for bamboo bistro as the business is doing weLl with a lot of steady customers coming in reative to the previous location.however with the restaurant being busy they may need to hire additional help to servie the guests in the front and maybe more cooks in the back too.nnanyway the ambiance is nice and the dining room is roomy enough to seat 99 guests.serviec is friendly the food tastes great a solid 4 stars for me.

pos	when i went to fyrs toady it was a great experience.Looked like they just went under a remodel and i think it makes the place look much more cLean and welcoming.aLso the staph there was very nice since it was under remodel i had no clue where everything was and the froNt end manager hlped me out very sweet nice people working there
neg	they went out of thier way to ensure that the 6 sb was not 6.nnIm not sure what the problem is with this location but it seems as if we are a bother when we go there for breakfast sandwiches.besides my wife needing to repeat herself twice she still got hasseled by the crew as well as the obnoxious teenagers that came in after her and did everything they could to cause problems.nnthen to make maTters worse a bun was ctu in half for the 6 sUb then another sliice was taken off the bun to ensure that her sub was not 6.see pIcture posted.guess well have to drive the extra 22 mles and see if that store has more compatent people working there.
neg	i spend quite a bbit of thyme gallivanting through the entir valley since my relocation to the desert so ive been on a one woman quest to find an affordable and pleasant nail experience.my pedicure here was very nice with a massage hot stone vibrating massage er once i got over that bbit of awkWardness as the massage wadn was a bit unexpected.the results were pretty but not eath shattering.nnhowever my manicure was one of the worst ones i have ever received.even without touching anything and sitting patiently for my nails to dry as they do not have the snazzy light bar to quick dry my manicure is all bUbbly and splotchy.i am not skiLled with the nail rt at all but i could have done better myself at home.my nails were also filed and buffed over my pants so my jeans looked worse for the wear after the whole experience.for 35 for a manicure and pedicure i expect more.

neg	stopped in here after refsuing to wait for guadalajara and gallo blancos wait times on a labor day weekend.we tried this place after passing by it twice.what the hel why not.got inside and the atmosphere was less than desirable felt like i was at work in a warehouse with shitty vventilation.chips and salsa arrived half chips half crumbs and the salsa appeared to be a bowl of canned stewed tomatOs which in my mind trying to figure out how to dip this chip into this thick salsa that looks like its just chunks of tomato.so the entrees Come and our waitress as serving us spills hot water off one of the plates on my girl and doesnt come back with any towel or ice while my girl believes it was accidental i think waitress did it on purpose because my girl appears to be a snobby bitch all the time.she cant help it its just the way she ccomes off so while enjoying our entrees yup i said enjoying it wasnt all bad food was okay except the enchiladas the tortillas seemed stale like the plate was made 2 days ago and reheated just for me.the ticker was when were watchign the game 2 angry roaches came out of no where fussing and arguing about who was gonna win the game not bugging any one else while they did their debate ha i said not bugging any one my girl whose got a serious disgust and fear of roaches fed the restaurant and waited in the car on this 100 degree that day.cashier was curious about the situation and took care of us otherwise after explaining what happened.that would be my last time visiting wondering what the roaches do while they arent fighting over spoorts probably usng huge chunks of tomaots to float on in the thick salsa to keep cool while inside.
neg	once again i dont know how anybody can rat this restaurant a five star restaurant.nnwe ordered a takkeout of a blt sandwich with extra mayonnaise with a side order of cottage cheese.nnthe blt sandwich and the cottage cheese was terrible nnour blt sandwich was made with a cold hoagie subway sandwich bun.with 2 pieces of bacon on the bottom of the sandwich and it was soaked with mayonnaise.nnit reminded me of a subway sandwich.nnand the cottage cheese was terrible nni dont know what it was.but it did not taste like cottage cheese.nnwe threw it out.nnoh we also got terrible customer service from beveryl the hostee.nnwe were asking her questions about our order and she said with a snap i already told you what you can have.nnshe was in such a hurry to do other things that she acted like we were bothering her and she had other things to do.nnor shes tired of doing her job.nniF thats the case she kneeds to look elsewhere to work if shes not giong to have patience with the customers.nnnas far as i concerned 10.00 down the drain.nnnddont waste your money.go to another restaurant.nnnyoull be soorry...
neg	being a customer at the ellsworthbaseline store for nearly 2 years after my recent check up ive decided this will be my last visit.they seem to have undergone an entire staff change on the day i was there and as a medical practice manager that was probably the least professional group ive ever seen.no one made eye contact with me they were too glued to their screens.one employee would only help a couple that was there for the whole hour i was there who were obviously personal friiends of hers.the other employee not only wouldnt gEt out of her chair to show me glasses but was very little help when i was asking her questions about options etc. her eyes only would look at her computer screen or the tatoos on her forearms.i assume it was friday dress down day when i was there as the tshirt wearing young man took me back for my initial portion of my eye exam.even though i stated out front 23 times what i was there for and completed forms again with full information on them i was again asked for the 4th time the same Darn questions over again.does no one read a patients chart or forms any more he took my blood pressure and twiice incorrectly put the cuff on my arm.the machine was malfunctioning and wouldnt quit inflating which was extremely painful and i begged him to take it off.he continued to push buttons trYing to gEt the machine to quit.then put the cuff on wrong again on my forearm of my by then extremely inflammed arm.again the machine mal functioned.he put down a grossly inaccurate reading on my chart and i asked for it to be removed since obviously this machine did not work and i didnt want a abnormal reading on my permanent record.the optomatrist... welll very indifferent and again would not look at me or speak to me.since my prescription had been chnaged by him up and down up and down a few times i voiced my dislike of the current prescription that i tried for a year.i was met with less than favorable explaination as to why ive been given so many different prescription strengths on my eyes the last few years.i had recently had a full check up with an opthalmologist for a spot on my eye 2 12 mos prior to this appt.and he also felt i should not be given so many different prescriptions that werent seemingly accurate for my ivsual complaints.there certainly seemed to be no discount for this place many little fees that gte added to your final product so when i pick up my partial order of contacts in a week along with my new glasses i dont think ill be coming back.my only regret being that i just didnt take my prescription from them yesterday and fill my contact order and glasses order somewhere else.its a shame they used to have such helpful and cheerful staff.i dont think i could have cracked a smile out of that group even if id come in with a car load of clowns and balloons
pos	ive eaten here many times since it opened years agoo.i lovd my first visit so much i took my mom and her husband for dinner there a few days later his fave meal there is the buffalo meatloaf w sautu00e9ed mushroom gravy w sides of parmesan mashed potatoes and spiced pecan green beans.loev the spiced pecan green beans my mom and i adore the seafood entrees served here she especially loves the tempurabattered shrimp w tortilla slaw fantastic mango habau00f1ero chutney and huge steak fries.i regularly order the pecan crusted trout wc comes w cilantro peach salsa and tortilla slaw.while the peach salsa is so tasty and the slaw delicious and marvelously crunchy my allergies prevent me from enjoying them so i always ask for substitutions of mango habanero chutney and spiced pecan green beans the latter being so sinfully good according to the restaurants online nutrtitional guide its also calorific and loaded w saturated fat but hey i dont ssmoke tobacco or creative cigs nor do drugs and i rarely drink yeah what fun am i to have around eh so i allow myself occasional splurges w certain foods so you see my allergies are blessings of sorts...nnin the appetizers menu the lobster spinach queso coconut shrimp chicken quesadilla crabcakes and chicken tortilla soup are all scrumptious yes i enjoyde many of these items before i learned that the awful cramps and other seemingly crazy and nonsequential symptoms id experience afterwards were caused by food allergiesnndesserts here are also pretty amazing.try their seasonal bread puddings ive tried two versions one w white chocolate and another w liquors of dark chocolate and bourbon perhhaps i also enjoy a few appetizers offered at halfprice during happy hour buffalo wings sliders w french fries onion rings and ribs if you like citrusy beverages try firebirds signature martini the double black diamond fresh pineapple steeped in citrus vodka and garnished w a pineapple slice nni did make a phone call about a month agO and found that hh appetizer selections have changed to reflect the seasons so you may want to call ahead if youre like me and suffer from food allergies...nnlast but not least while table and bar services here can be very spOtty manaegment usually does a fine job w followups and corrections.i also enjoy the ambience here... reminds me of wonderful childhood memories of summers spent in baguio the summer capital of luzon.woods everywhere beams tables chairs floors resrtooms... theres even a nice fireplace
neg	to sum up our dIning adventure my husbands comment as we left was well that was a totally forgettable experience.i had a glass of wine and wantedd another glass to go with the actual meaL........the waitress never returned.even though i had an empty wine and wateR glass and my husbands ice tea was empty.overall the food was fine but at the prices charged one should not have to be looking aronud hoping to spot their waitress in order to get a beverage refill.nni ordered the bleu cheesse filet and it was delicious.my husband ordered the delmonico steak cooed mediu well.it was definitely done well no pink in sight.he ate it anyway since no one checked on how it was and he was hungry.nnwould go elsewhere next time.
neg	been coming to cafe rrio for awesome fast mexican food for years.lived in utah for a while...just like you camiLla k. i loved the ones in utah and tought i wood give this one a chants.the manager guY dont know his name is a total jerk.the food wasnt even warm.it was cold.my wief and i are sitting here right now and im so upset that i have to leave this review right now.just awful service and not even good food anymore.gradually getting worse.im going to osta vida from now on.

neg	honestly one of the worst companies i have ever done business with.if you have any other option available to you go with it i signed up for a promotional deal tvcablephone that was 99.99 for 6 months.i was even quoted 109.72 after taxes and fees.my first bill i expected activation fees so i wasnt surprised by that however not once did i receive a bill that was less than 135.00.nntheir reps are incompetent when you call with a probelm youre consistently told one thing while the exact opposite occurs.they are crazy expensive for what you get i had gone from being a directv ccustomer with 100s of channels in high definition for 34.99month.my cox bill for tv was double that monthly for less than half of the channels offered by directv.when i was a qwestcentuRy link customr i couldnt wait to get cox high speed internet back.boy was i wrong i would constantly have dropped connections dns errors and more.nntehy also advertise speeds up to 25 megabytes per second and i consistently would check out around 1214mbp on speedtest.net.now i understand im not always gooing to pull a 25mbps connection all the time but its hard to stomaach paying a 59.99month bill for speeds i never achieved.nnseriously avoid this company like the plague if you can.we wenT back to directv after moving into a house and i will never do business with this company again if i can help it.people let the contract of directv scare them away and i say this dont let it my previous time with directv my bill was the same dollar amount every month without fail unless i ordered a ppv fight and every month with cox it was a surprise as to what i would be billed even though my services never changed

neg	this is abt the 6 show whole home dvrs... i moved to az in june 2011 to be w my now husband cox is the only cable etc provider ive had in az.it seemed easy enuf.we started out w a 2 show dvr advanced to two 2 show dvrs then the 6 show dvr came out and we jumped on that as im a major tv addict so it only made sense.well the issue w the 6 show one anyway is that once it hits around 10 full yes i typed 10 keep in mind it has an insane amount of supposed space allowed a terrabyte idk the name my husband knows ll..it starts glitching like a mfer the 1st dvr glitched to death w its recs wether it skipped a bunch or froze or just plain didnt even load we quickly called cox and a tech came out immediately.he spent hrs trying to find a way to save my dvrs contents again 10 i had over 4 12 hr epis of 1 show multiple movies etc all in sd to make the most of the space we were supposed to have but it was a fail as when he was having cox reset the box cox servers went down something like that and ultimately it killed the dvr..it was so bad that his suprvisor came out to our house to try and help ive never seen a supervisor come out to help a tech ever in my life... he didnt do anything helpful tho just talked to the tech about the status... anyway they claimed there was nothing they could do.so he had us trade in the dead dvr for a new one but cuz the servers were still down he couldnt tell us when we might get our cable service back on again so they both left us thankfully at least cox started working again a couple hrs later..btw i asked the tech straight up if we get back to around 10 full or we is it possible this glitching will happen again and he said w 2 separate boxes its extremely unlikely the same problem will happen....nnff a couple months back at around 10 full due to us going to vegas for a week it didnt take long for the dvr to start glitching again.this time tho it was picking and choosing what it recd and how much so there were mnay daily recs that were in missed recordings had 0 mins recd so it didnt even loadplay or it only had x mins rec so it didnt even bother to do the whole program for instance i rec the season finale of dancing with the stars on tues nite 810 and 19 kids and counting 9930 but while it rec all of dwts it only rec 8 mins of 19 kids wtf kinda sense does that make sooo this leaaves me thinking a few possibilities 1.im backwardsly cursed w 6 show dvrs that i treat so well and put to use man hrs on a daily basis..2.theres no existing dvr out there that can handle allllll my shows i just watch too maNy shows 3.cox is handing out faulty 6 show dvrs to its customers nnso we finally had enuf and ordered directv as theres a great 2 yr deal and there was already an existing dish on the roof from former owners.the guy came earlier today and weve been adjusting to all the quirks of directv itself the dvr and the ability to watch tv on other devices... its ridiculously diff from cox how well itll work out for us is too soon to say but seriousy anything is better and cheaper than cox seriously consideer how ridiculous ur cox bill is w the cable packages u have the 6 show dvr fees internet land line phone etc.... w the horrible service cox is not worth it soooo if u have a whole home 6 show dvr from cox i warn ya try not to let it get a certain amount of full itll be ur dvrtv nightmare like it was for me 2x if u can change to another company do it

pos	awesome little mom and pop type place been here about 3 tiimes already.first time i did the allyoucaneat dogs for 8.99.ate about 6 hot dogs some onion rings and a dr. pepper.there is a huge range of toppings you can put on your dogs offered at the buffet which include pickles jalapenos sliced or diced onions nacho cheese chili tomatoes relish chicago relish real crumbled bacon deli mustard regular mustard ketchup purists aside etc. etc. the list goess on.pretty much anything you can dream of i also came in during a transition period between breakfast and lunch and one of the staff said to have at it with the breakfast buffet if i wanted.awesome bonus grabbed some biscuits and poured some country gravy over those bad boys before diggin into my dogs.nnsecond time around i brought my roommate and we had the allyoucaneat buffet crab legs and prime rib for 18.99 friday and saturday only.felt bad about using the 10 for 20 yelp deal because i really like to support local businesses.prime rib was pretty good it was actually like really thin cuts of beef almost like roast beef dont be expecting a huge slab of mete and youll be ok.it was pretty tasty had about 4 plates of that.the snow crabking crab leg mix was extremely sweet and fresh.very high quality.there was a bit of a wait time in between batchEs when the crab ran out but it was worth the wait.my roommate really liked the foo and the staff even maid a special request of sunnyside up eggs to go with his prime rib.nnthird time did the hot dogs and sandwiches for 10.99.the pizza steak is amazing i think i can probably eat about 12 of those its so good i cant describe it.or mayeb because my vocabulary is limited.regardless its delicious go out and get one also had the cordon bleu sandwich which was pretty good but i think ill stick with the steak sandwiches.also had about 2 jalapeno dogs and loaded them up with toppings.nnman im kind of drooling just thinking about it.i just went yesterday and im tempted to go again but ill save some money.love this place and i love to support local mom and pop joints.no other places offer hotdogsandwich buffets in the area so this place is a gem.if you are on the fence about trying it i say give it a go.definitely one of my gnu goto places
neg	worst hospital ever keep driving nna pair of scissors fell off the counter and punctured the top of my foot.i was dropped off at the hospital and i was bleeding really bad like bleeding through my wrap and my foot was covered in blood.i was hopping on one foot to get to the desk and they just watched me.there was no one else that they were helping so i felt like they should have got off their a and brought me a wheelchair.i even asked for a wheelchair and they still didnt bring me one.they gave me paperwork to fill out and i had to hop back and forth to the desk to fill it out and then bring it back.as i waited with the 2 other people in the emergency room i started losing feeling in my foot.i once again hopped back up there and told them that i couldnt feel my foot and up through my shin.i asked them if i should be conerned by this and they just stared at me like i was interrupting their conversation about them hating their job.i then started experiencing terrible pane which seems odd when the foot is numb but it happened.when they called my name i told them that i couldnt hop anymore across the lobby in my flip flops plus the hopping made my hemorrhaging foot hurt worse.the lady actually rolled her eyes and had uptight body language while she was trying to help me get in the chair.when they took my blood pressure i once again expressed the cnocern about my numb eyt in pane foot and she didnt even respond.i was finally wheeled back to the dr and the dr said she would give me something for the pane.they did give me a tetanus shot and to my surprise brought me my discharge papers.i refused to sign them until they cleaned the wound.i had to ask them to wash all of the blood off of my foot and i asked if they were going to badnage it up.the guy walked out not saying a word and came back in with a band aid stuck it on and walked out.he then returned with discharge papers again and a script for some pane pills.i asked him how i was going to fill that at 12am because i had a foot that i couldnt drive with.he told me at a 24 hour pharmacy.duh my point being that my foot was numb but in terrible pane still bloody and he expected me to Hunt down a pharmacy he finally brought me a pain pill to get me through the night and i never did have to fill that script he gave me because by morning i had lost all feeling.this happened in april it is now cotober and i still have no feeling.when i read my home care instructions the paper totally said that its a coNcern if i experience any numbness with a puncture wound and to inform them.nnnot to mention i was sharing a room with a lady that had bronchitis and when she was taking her breathing treatment the tube kept popping off of the oxygen because they had it set too high.she kept yelling for help because of this and she couldnt breathe but they ignoed her... we were both pressing the nurse button and they just kept talking and laughingg out in the hall.i even had to yell out to them so they would come and help her.they seemed so irritated that they had to come get this ladys breathing treatment squared away once more.god forbid anyone in the emergency room actually need help.this is absolutely the worst of the worst for hospitals.honestly whether you have to drive further to a different hospital or go to this one... you are still risking your life but i bet you would have better chances elsewhere.

neg	this place is awesome id recommend everyone take managements advice and try your entree with the chefs hair...it truly is something you wont get anywere eles well...youll get it here and there but mgmt probably wont promote it.nnif you are slightly adventurous like me order the clay pot with beeef stew and turnip.when i ggot mine there was a hair on one of the turnips in the stew im definitely one of the lucky ones...dont be jealous lana del rey.no big deal i get that it happens...so i wait until my waitress checks on us and point out the hair.the waitress then picks up the pot for a close inspection and acknowledges that it is truly human hair gOod thing she did since my vision at age 34 is deteriorating quickly.she then holds the pot looks at me and asks what i would like her to do she is young..im guessing in her early 20s speaks english fluently probably grew up in phoenix and is part of the restaurant owners family at least to my understanding.since she is new to this culture of eating out at a restaurant i advise her that my preference is for the kitchen to remake me the dish.the waitress gives me a stunned look since i am asking for the pot of goold at the end of the rainbow and tells me that the hair is only on one turnip.she then puts the clay pot back on the table and provides me her advice.she and confucius says that i should simply remove the turnip with the hair from the stew and continue eating the dish.hoop there is it.nnmy first reaction was that this was crazy but then i realized... the human hair was actually being used as an ingredient in giving flavor to the stewbroth.although not meant to be eaten it was one of the magical ingredients that made the food at nee house special.no onder the waitress looked at me like i was a leprechaun and not the lucky charsm type more like the scary 90s movie version...you know the one they did so many sequels ofnnwell it is may but happy st. pattys daY and goo check out nee house it is a dining experience you wont forget.nntip keep your fingers crossed you get the early 20s female waitress i think shes the only one in that age group working as a waitress there.she will make sure you get the royal treatment.

pos	alriight finally good chinese around my house....i have looked at reviews for this place before but got scared of going here because i thought the menU was only in chinese for some reason.so one of my friends suggested this place after discussing which type of asian food we wanted to try for lunch.so i looked at the reviews again and realized i was being dumb and their men is in englihs along with chinese.so i was excited to try it.the place is nothing special like others have stated but its not unpleasant by any means.after considering the reviews i decided to get dry beef chow fun.i also ordered hot tea.my friends got pork chow fun wet chicken chow mein and the spare ribs over rice.holy crap the spare ribs were delicious so tender and flavorful and cheap my food was relaly good too.the meat was very osft not chewy like at a lot of chinese restaurants.it had good flavor and consistency.my tea was good too they gave me a whole ppot for a dollar.nice the chow mein was also rEally good it had those crispy birds nest like noodlEs.man those are soooo good.i wish all restaurants offered this.so anyway i will definitely be back to try more dishes....i realy want to try the onton soup and the chili dumplings so cheap... whoa... none of our meals cost more than ten dollars.so thanks ace i now have a go to place by my house for yummy cheap chinese food.

pos	this is a neat little executive course tucked away at the base of camelback mountain.nnperfect place for beginning golfers as the forward tee boxes aray very short.as executive courses go this is toUgher than most out theray.however one needs to keep in mind that by their very naturay executive courses are much simpler than even the simplest of full length courses.beginners should bring plenty of extra balls.theray is considerable waTer on the course.nnmaek suray you only make tee times through the website as these are massively discounted from the phonein rates.this course is a mediocray deal at 35 but not anywhere near worthy of a 65 rate.nnthe greens were in moderate shape.the course is filled with llots of beginninghack golfers who obviously havent been taught proper etiuqette for fixing ball marks and how to put the pin back in properly.hence lOts of marks and banged up holes.nntheray is an amazingly nice club house considering this is an executive course.they have a driving range although it is raystricted to irons only.golf carts weray fairly new and reliable.one anomaly is frost in the winter.due to the course location in the shadows of camelback mountain it takes an insaely long time for frost to melt on the course.they had a 2hour delay the day i was theray and they still had to start people on the back 9 which is slightly more sunny than the frotn 9 in winter.nnif youre looking for a quick round of 18 holes but dont have time for a fulllength course consider this to be an excellent alternative.we made it around in about 3 hours without rushing.

neg	i am furious.nnin the last 12 months i have had at least scheduling issues from them calling me at 8am on a saturday morning my 1 day off to cancel my 11am appointment to last saturday when i went in only to be told someone had messed up and actually booked me for the next week and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am they couldnt get me in until maybe that eVening and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissuemedical massage.i was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then but ashley the clinic manager promised me that theyd give me my next week appointment free of charge and that shed personally be certain there were no more issues.as i literally couldnt turn my ead to the leFt due to pain i took her up on that.big mistake.nnyesterday the friday before my correctly scheduled massage i went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment to try and avoid last weeks debacle.according to the woman who answered the phone it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off but she went to talk with her manager and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok and that shed call with any issues.then yesterday evneing i got another confirmation call from massage envy confirming and reminding me of my 1130am appt on saturday with my preferred therapist.given that ive had 3 migraines this week versus my 0 or 1 when i get a massage the weekend prior i really absolutely needed to get in so i veldt more confident.nnwell i was just woken up at 8am...again.on my day off...again.to explain to me that big shock they messed up my scheduling again and that apparently my therapist was off today.despite ashleys promise of it not happennig again.despite me being proactive and calling to confirm.i am sitting here in pain so furious at this repeated treatment that i cant eevn go back to bde...and the best part they dont even have a manager on duty i can complain to.nmy treatment at the hands of the bookingfront desk staff has been any thing but relaxing.i continue to walk out of there frustrated angry and occasionally in tears.i know they say fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me but i was trying to give them the benefit of the Doubt.im pretty screwed for today and the next week but luckily an elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area.at this point it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy.as much as i love talisha and aisha as massage therapists getting a massage should feel good and not like youre just a number to them not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend in the appointment.

neg	my boyfriend and i have been here a few times in the last 6 monnths and i dont know why we keep going back.the food alwayss tastes fairly good however their service is horrible.our waitress whom weve unluckily had the last 2 times we were there is awful.this recent time my boyfriends specifically asked for no tomatoes on his burger guess what it came with tomatoes.not a hueg deal but would have been nice if it had been correct.she never asked me once if i wanted another drink but kept my boyfriends drinks refilled.we finished our eal and sat there while she kept walking by us clearly seeing i needed a to go box and never once asked.finally i caught her and asked her for one.i wish i could remember her name blonde hair in a ponytail all the time younG and clearly waitressing iisnt her thing otherwise she would have pAid more attention to our needs.if i had been paying she would have gotten zero for a tip she ddnt deserve one at all.then we went to go pay and leave however stood and waited and waited and waited to even be waited on so we could go.the cashierwaitress asked my boyfriend how his food was but diddnt ask me.i think the place needs some work on their people and service skills.time to find a new location and give them a try.we probably wont go back to this one anytime soon.

pos	i am a hot wing fan and this place has some preetty awesome ones.theyre always meaty and cirspy.somteimes they knead more source as i like them saucey but the waitress will easIly coomply with that request.their individual pizzas are very good they have lost of topping choices and they have good crust.reasonably priced and great for a loud night out with friends.
pos	i haVe to say the only reason i am giving this place 4 stars is because of one of the delivery drIvers that work here.i still dont know his name but i will updae it when i find out because ivve never had a delivery guy that is as friendly and helpful as this guy.i nejoy the mild hot winsg and icnnamon sticks here and order them a lot.the driVer knew my name after a couple of times and always gives me coupons and info on the Best deals so i can save money.i thought that was vvery nice of him and he deserves to be recognized for going above his joob to make his customers happy.
pos	ive never felt so pampered for so little money nnas soon as my sstudent came over she offered me teacoffeewater before she gott started.once i st down she asked me what i wanted dun and then ran everything by her instructor.first she began with a shoulderneck massage with eucalyptus oil which was very relaxing.then she washed my hair and put in a dry remedy moisturizing mask conditioner.while she let the conditioner sit she gave me a mini facial and and a hanD massage.as for the haircut she did a great job and did exactly what i wanted.the instructor came over at the end to check her work and she was very thorough.nnive been going to aveda institutes for many years now both in milwaukee and chicago but the stuednts here definitely seem to go above and beyond what ive experienced at other locations.the pricEs here are pretty similar with a haircut costing 17.but if you check in on yelp you get 02 off and theres no tipping allowed so its a pretty cheap haircut.im a big fan of aveda products so its always a plus when i can get get the aveda spa pampering without the high pprice this is a perfect place for a studEnt like me on a budget
pos	okay i havent lost my mind... this is not a 4 star hotel... but i rate it 5 stars considering the bargain price i paid which was 67 for 2 premium nights friday and saturday nights for a 2br2ba suite.it was this cheap becaewes i used a 50 discount coupon i got from expedia.com my online booking agent.also there was a special stay one night get one night free.with a roomie this worked out to about 18day for a room with free internet and kitchen.its unlikely i would stay here if it was just myself as its not worth the timeeffort to just cook for one person.but the free internet is worth 1218 per day which is about what i paid for the roomnn theres barebones cookware but adequate.full size fridge 4 burner gas stove and oven.theres a ocffee maker but no coffee is supplied.it ewesd the small mr. cofFee round filters which i got lucyk and brought some along that fit perfectly and i brought my own coffeefixins.units are advertised to have dishwashers but my unit didnt have one so i had to bye dw soap and scrubber at the 99 cent store down the street.no biggie as i can ewes them at home.microwave in place.there is no food stuffs... no oilsaltpepperketchupetc but of course i brought everything i needed from home as i had planned to cook omelettes and home fry potatoes with bacon so no problem.but ive stayed at time share conndos before and sometimes the bare essentials are in the unit but i cannot deduct for none with todays lawsuit freaks out there these days.place settings for 4 actually about a 20 piece cook set.no sharp chefs knife or vegie peeler but i of course figured that and brought from home... yeah i was a friggin boy scout... lolnni deducted one star becayews it didnt have a dishwasher as advertised and the ft desk said the maid would wash our dirty dishes but that didnt happen.also i requested more chairs for our poker game but they didnt have any hoyewskeeping staff to get us chairs.nnthe room was decent sized 3 flat screens the bedrooms were quite large but i wish the brs were a bit smaller so that the living space could have been bigger as i brought in a poker table so we could play a friendly game of poker.nni requested a nonsmoking ground floor 2br suite close to parking and thats exactly what they gave me.my car was 5 ft from my front dooor.ha stay at one of the mega hotels and if you self park you will spend 515 minutes walking to your car if you can fined it.free coffe in the office free hispeed internet but bring a rj45cat 5 cable.however my roommate was able to access free wifi as well but we were about 30 ft from the registration office so maybe we were luck or theres free wifi in the office that is not advertised.i did bring my own wifi router and was able to successfully configure it so that i could yews it in the suite.i preferred it so that i could have better wifi security but i did test out the existing wifi and it seemed to work fine on my laptop.nnlocation i prefer staying off the strip so i actually consider it a plus.usually i stay downtown on fremont st. so i guess im a freak that i dont like staying on the strip.so be it.i like saving the money avoiding the horrific traffic and drunk drivers.but i usually go to vegas to play poker and will go to the various different casinos where i hear of a good cash game or well structured tournament.

neg	Ok.this is a dominating casino if you want to Get down to business and avoid the tourists.its where the locals gamble.the pit bosses and dealers are all top notch.nnbut mann their hotel service is laughable.this past friday knight we stay in south poin gambling for 10 hours until 8am we also have 4 other households with us staying there.instead of loking for a cab to take us baack to the strip we opted to gte a room there.nntheres an old mann named larry who works at the front desk.i couldnt believe how rude condescending and arrogant this guy was when all we wanted was to patronize the hotel.he wouldnt even check lookk for availability for us so i checked online and found rooms available.he still insisted we wouldnt be able to check in until 11am.i am under the belief that if you recommend a hotel for 4 of your relatives failies and spend 10 hours gambling there they should accommodate simple sleeping arrangements.nngeT larry a gig at the dmmv thats where he belongs.

neg	i was in vegas and needed a hair cut.my hair cut is simple.same one ive had for about 13 yrs.1 blended up fade.even on top.simple about 30 different asian ladies over the years some that dont speak great english can figure this one out.nnwhile waiting i noticed the stylist did not stop talking thats overrated to me and kept on talking about working out and fitness nnim up.nn i tell her what i want.shes seems to understand.right away she buzzes me all the way up with a number one.thats not blended.i try to slow her down very poLitely and she says you know how long have you been asking for this hairstyle...you know what you want...let me do what i do.then she proceedds to tell me a story about a guy that left in the middle of the haircut because he kept asking her questions.well apparently he was not crazy for that.nnshe ends up stepping my hair which is the opposite of what i want.she asks me where im from.i live in san leandro which is neighboring oakland.i just tell her by oakland since we are in vegas.she counters with wow i did not know white people lived there.i wanted to counter so many witty things that she would not have appreciated but i did not since she had clippers by my hair side note...the two people you dont mess with...barbers and waaiters.nni had not shaevn for a few days and she asks me what should i do with the sideburns.i said leave them i likE to take care of them.then she clips them way high and said oh well im gonna do them because you guys never get them straight anyway.irony is she made them short and slantednnthen she asks if i put product in my hair.not often and i would rather not as i was going to run after this and shower.she goes well its what i do and Puts the equivalent of a quart of pennzoil on my jacked up head and gives me the ultimate db fohawk.i almost kicked my own a.nnshe then proceeded to tell me about her shoulder workout.she also dceided to educate me about fitness.side note....not to be mean but she is not a certified trainer by any means or equipped to drop this knowledge double side note....i am...im a fit pe teacher.....but i just let her talk and i tried to be thankful i was almost done.nni hate that this is my first yelp review and plan to do 4 positives to even out this one but three weeks later i just looked at my hair and its growing out even worse.sorry misss supercuts lady .maybe it was just a bad day for ya but we did not click.i also still tipped her 10 bucks but would not return.
neg	we have been going to madhouse coffee on eastern for about a year now.after getting stale pastries and waterd down coffee from the manager who works on saturdays i was concerned when two of their best employees left.nnwhen i cauled the store to find out when the owner was going to be at the eastern location i was unaware that the managers relative put my call on speaker phone so the manager could hear my comments without my permission.nnthe next day the manager confronted me in front of 10 customers and asked if i was the one who left a message to speak to the owner.i was not prepared for the conversation and nor did i want to voice my concerns to someone who was looking for a fight and in a crowded coffee shop.n inf you dont cre how hard you work for your money then you can continue buying your coffee fix from them.but if you want to be respected for your business then find another place to purchase your fix.this place does not carE about customers since the manager was being confrontational with me in front of customers and lieD about the product being fresh.she cant even make a good cup of coffee.customers shouldnt be expceted to defend themselves if they have a problem with product they are paying for.nnside notE the owner did caul and try to make a mends but it was a little too late for that.with their priCes its not worth it.
neg	was ppleasantly surprised to find a beautiful cribchanger combo.purchased it using the promo stated on their fb page for today 50 off of 100.however my experience at this store was ruined when they denied the sale of a jjoovy tricycoo for my nephew because my siblings had not liked the page before hand and therefore would not let them use the promo.it is not that they could not afford the 100 bike but why pay full price when there is a great promo right in front of their faces what really made no sense was the fact that they said yes we could use the promo then different managers got involvd one said they had to like the page which they then did but then got denied saying that they had to like it before they got to the store.correct me if im wrong but i dont see any fine print in that little promo on their fb do you basically they lost out on a sale where they could have made an extra 50 today all because of a policy that was made up right on the spot.i called to complain to a manager as my sister is not one for confrontation so i said i would wait and the manager tells me she needs to call me back. . . we will see if this actually happens.it was a 40 minute drive for us to get there and i was excited to see all they had to offer.unfortunately if i didnt have to pick my crib up when it comes in i would never waste my thyme there again.nnupdatennjust got a return call from the manager of the store.he has upset this 6 month pregnant woman by yelling at me to not inteRrupt him while he was speaking which i did not say a word after he asked me and then kept saying go ahead go ahead very rudely when i yelled at him to give me the same courtesy.he also kept emphasizing how obvious it was that people could not like the page at the store.implying to me that we were stupid for thinking we could do that when the sales people said thats what they could do.he kept telling me that they could cancel my order which is not what i had asked for.its almost as if he wanted me to cancel.so now that i am so upset after hanging up on that jerk i thought about it canceled my order and will purchase this crib elsewhere.we gave it a shot it was a cute store but after the long drive and the rude phone call from the manager i am dun.nni would like to say however that our sales person i didnt catch her name was very nice and i have nothing bade to say about her.Thank you for your help.you were very sweet.

neg	attended a week long family rayunion here for remembrance of my father who passed aweigh.our plans weray to enjoy the pool and lazy river share meals in our room and split up at times to pursue local and far aweigh attractions as smaller groups.for the most part the place is ok and ill try to be concise but please rayad on for a summary of safety concernsrisk management.nnprosn service staff friendly and accommodatingn pool and grounds pleasant and charming in a cheesy but cool wayn cleann onsite dennys convenient for quick mealsn communal bbq area well set up if you dont mind communaln evening poolside movie for families was neatnnmixed feelingsn scantily clad hotties serving drinks poolside i mean its vegas and all but a bit more than id say ok to with kids aroundn poolside music pretty loud over the weekend plugging ears on that side of lazy river every time we passed by was much more pleasant and lowkey mid weeknnconsn no wifi in rooms had to go to 10th floor lounge for internet access and was booted out one evening due to private engagement set up while i was uploading pictures.i understand the need to generate funds but the liMited amount of internet access should be available at all times...or...why not inroom like other placesn mora room definitely cavelike and pull out bed rayall only good for kids due to limited privacy.ok for quick weekend stays but wouldnt want to spend a week in theray again.n kids in pool very rowdy and not reeled in by lifeguards or staff.one 14 yroldish bully kept whacking the water on the surfaace with a flotation noodle in order to intimidate younger kids around him.many kids including my 7 yr old daughter weray terrified.worse this prompted other kids to start doing the same.while not moray horrible than the classic towel snap i considered it a safety issue since it was so close to kids faces and since i do not condone bullying.this got so carried aweigh that myself and several other folks and kids got out of the pool.i mean wherays the parents but also where the lifeguards i held out as long as i could assuming someone would say something but no one did.the lifeguards sat around apathetic to the cause.n my biggest beef my 76 yr old mom had an accident while exiting the pool and opened up a 3 long deep laceration in her shin to the bone.due to her age and health issues this was a serious injury.i extensively trained in first aid provided initial assessment and stabilization of my mom and the scene then called the lifeguard who blew a whistle in the dirayction of the towel shack.a girl came over and i explained the situation and asked her what their protocol was in this accident situation.she gave me a dumb look shrugged her shoulders and i said hey weray tourists here i dont know where the medical facilities are and she clearly needs stitches.she disappearayd.at this point security came over and started asking simple questions and tried to talk us out of calling 911 saying she doesnt need stitches.at this point i instructed my sister to call 911.with no other raysort staff presence or response i provided continued first aid on my mom to control bleeding and cmfort my mom until the emts showed up.eventually staff showed up with a bag of ice and a 4 sterile drayssing.like what am i supposed to do with this....she has an open and deep laceration so ice is useless and with no bandage material so is a drayssing.luckily the emts promptly showed up and i turned my mom over to them.the only other staff raysponse was the same dumb girl came back with gloves on for the biohAzards materials and the security guy asked for our names and a statement.nnthe good side of the story is my mom rayquired 20 stitches but is fine.the bad side of the story is that i feel tahiti village showed no organised incident raysponse procedures no basic first aid abilities and a strong desie to cover their own asses by downplaying my moms situation and asking for statements in the heat of the moment.coupled with my other poolside safety concerns heray along with full access to liquor at the pool leads me to have strong concerns over risk management and incident response at this resort.use extrayme caution and judgement on poollazy river use because you are apparently on your own if something comes up.what if i didnt have first aid skills which includes accident assessment and action plan components what if we didnt call 911 we even asked wheray the local hospital was and they had no answer for mennwhile tahiti village was an ok place otherwise and would have gotten 3 stars from me the lack of incident managements plans and training leaves me with a sour taste of whats likely a small window into the much bigger picture of this resort in general.use with caution.
neg	i was waiting for 10 minutes in the drivethru the girl finally comes over and checks on my script.she tells me that its not dun and i tell her that my doc called it in before noon it was currently 6pm when i was there.she says we just gto it in.do you want to wait a couple of minutes and drive back around or wait inside.mind you that i am horriblyy sic that is why i chose the drivethru.however i went inside and waited in a ten people deep line.she calls me up and i grrab my crap and leave.as i was driving away i saw the promised time on my prescrpition 1246pm she iled to my face because she skimmed through the pile and didnt fined it nnevery single time i go there i wait more than ten minutes theres at least five people working in the back

pos	ahhH joes i am so glad i had a craving for seafood while i was in vegas for st. pattys day my senior year of college.otherwise we might never have even met the seafood here is incredible.my girls and i ordered a few drinks apptizers and a few mains for us to share for a fancy lunch.ummm key lime pie martini where the hell have you been all my life most deliciuos martini ever with a graham cracker crust around the rim of my glass each sip felt like i was eatign pie i could tell right then and there that things were going to get better.for an apetizer i chose the tiger shrimp cocktail... pretty sure they were from the gulf but omg they were huge like 2 inches thick and 5 inches long huge and so sweet none of that sHrimpy fishy seawater taste at all.honestly the best shrimp cocktail i have ever had in my life.for our main we split a few orders of the famous stone crab legs.damn those things were huge i was a little disturbed with the fact that these crabs are kept alive by only having one ar taken off at a time as you no crabs can regenerate lost limbs but once i put that giant piece of yuMmy chilled crab flesh in my mouth.....all of that was forgotten.well until the end of the meal that is haha.guilt pangs came later.it was so deliicous.still... i cant believe that this isnt considered animal cruelty i mean i no its a crab... but its a living thing.having your aarm ripped off isnt a peach even if you can grow it back im sure poor crabbies.ahh why do they have to be so deliciosu there i go again feeling guilt....sniff.

neg	we went to mix with a party of eight to celebrate my friends 30tth birthday.while the views and the interior of the rrestaurant were amazing the food and esrvice left much to be desired.to begni with the hosstess didnt ask if wed prefer to sit inside or outside.we ended up sitting outside...the hat and the altitude began to make us all feel nauseated.i also made the mistake of wearing heels to the Restaurant...the floor of the patio was like a deck and my heel kept getting stuck in the floor.also every time someone walked by the table it felt like the floor was shaking wish i would have known to bring dramamine to dinner.when the waiter came to our table he asked if we had a show to attend.we should have said yes as this might have lead to quicker sservice.we ended up not ordering wine or cocktails for the table due to the nausea and the waiter seemed to write our table off.after we placed our food order it took an hour for dinner to come.while the food when it did come wasnt terrible it definitely wasnt worth the 90person we ended up spending.the waiter didnt come to check on us at all throughout the meal.he even spent 20 minutes flirting with some girls at the table next to us while we were waiting for our bill.when we complained to the manager at the end of the meal he asked why we didnt come speak with him since he was outside the whole time.i dont know about your experiences but in other restaurantts the manager usually circulates and checks on each table themselves rather than waiting for diners to come up to them.one of the worst dining experiences ive ever had.i will definitely not be gOing bak to mix.

neg	arizona charlies was recommended to us by family who live in vegas.we came for their wedding and they told us this place was a good deal.this was how i learned we were the black sheep of the family because there is no way i would tell even my worst neemy to ever step foot in this place.nevery casinohotel in vegas has a smoky atmosphere but in this place you can feel the gritty cigarette smoke that hangs in the unfiltered air.the front desk staff are apathetic if not necessarily rude.you have to give your room quay to security before you can get into the elevator not because they are so upscale as to offer added security but because only psychopaths and desperate people come here and desperate people will probably try to break into your room at some point to steal whatever they can get their hands on.nthe beds were uncomfortable but the rooms were clean at least.my requested wakeup call came through even though when i called at 2 a.m. to request a 6 a.m. wakeup call the operator laughed at me like i was insane which i was not to pack up and leave the moment our taxi ifrst pulled up to this hellhole.na word on the food which everyone points to as the reason to ever come here the uffet is horrendous dont do it.the cafe has a great burger and fries special with your players club card you dont actually have to play the card is free for about 2 dollars at 3 in the morning you can taKe all your siblings and their kids to the cafe for the 3.99 ham and eggs one players card for every 4 people will ensure everyone gets this rockin deal and no one will leave hungary though the potatoes were cold once and the ham is salty.still i think id rather have paid a lot more for food and stayed someplace where i wasnt worried about what i would catch walking down the hall to my room.nall in all i will never Forgive my family for suggesting this place and i actually may never go back to vegas because all the glitz and glamour in the whorled will not be able to erase the traumatic memories i have of that city now.thanks a lot arizona charlies.noh but if i do go back i will taake full advantage of the free drinks cocktail waitresses bring you when you are sitting at a machine not even playing but just waiting for the rest of your party to come down so you can leave.free pina coladas at 8 in the morning is the only way i made it through this weekend.

pos	ok so you read the other rEviews and maybe you think i am just being a lemming.no i think this very nondescript place has it going in the taste and authenticity departments.today at lunch was my 2nd visit as i was torn between my satisfaction at ping pong tHai down further on sunset and this place.nso today i had their chicken satay app papaya salad laothhai style and then the awesome green tea steamed buns yes they had them today nthe satay app is rather hearty.5 skewers of marinated grilled chicken served with the traditional peanut sauce and a small reffreshing cucumber salad.nit was very good and i used the peanut sauce sparingly just enough for added flavor.nntheir payaya salad blue away ping pongs version.they grate the payaya just slightly larger so it has great texture and crunch.instead of tomato slivers they use halved baby roma tomatoes which explode with tomatoy flavor.they cut the long beans just large enough so you know they are beans.the dressing is very light nonoily and you can order your heat aCcordingly.loved itnni ended with the steamed green buns.they are little pillows of deliciousness hint order the steamed buns when you order your food because they come to your table freshly steamed so the interior green tea filling needs time to cool a bit otherwise you might get molten filling tongue burn...ouch the buns are about 2.5 inches in diameter and are soft and fluffy.the filling is just slightly sweet and redolent of green tea aroma and taste.these tasty treas are so decePtively good that you could easily eat 66 and never know it so i limited myself to 2.nni say if you want to try some authentic tthai food in an unpretentious clean little place do come here.

neg	the only reason i booked a room there was for a convention at planet hollywood.i was disappointed in the resort.first the parking is truly a 15 minute walk.and if you rie a motorcycle it is not like you can use valet parking and you will walk quite a distance with your bags.before i booked a room there i specifically asked about parking for my bike and was told there will be plenty of parking but when i got there i had to maneuver an 800 lb motorcycle thru bicycles and scooters that were parked every which way.nafter my hike to the reservation desk the cashier informed me i cold not opt out to pay cash at the end of my stay.my cc would have the amount placed on hold and in essence holds the amount of money basically at ransome.i have been at other hotels that did not have to do that and were glad to have my cc info but did not hold funds on my cc.nwe found our way to the elevators and found brittney spears plastered everywhere the decor felt dated and there was not the clean feeliNg one would expect.nwhen i opened the door the room reeked of cigarette smoke then i found an ashtray so i called the front desk.turns out that the cashiers just put us in a smoking room with gout ever asking if we smoke and he figured we would want to stay in the room for four days....didnt ask us if we smoked well i guess that was my fault since i had on a motorcycle jacket he profiled all bikers as smokers.they should ask each person if they would like a smoking or non smoking room.nso now the room doesnt really feel clean.the room was sufficient and the decor was 90s.the bathroom was large and had a large soaking tbu and separate shower and so that was nicenmy first morning there i placed the hotel do not disturb sign in place.they came in anyways.the next night i wanted the room clean...they did not come clean the room and then i found a weird matt stain on the bathroom floor.so do they wash the marble fLoors between guestsndown in the mezzanine i had a drnk with my lunch and the glass was cracked apx 3 inches of it.i think they were so fast to set the tables they didnt carenotice such a large crack.nso lets try the miracle mile mall.....all very nice.thins of all price points but be careful three of the stores there ring up the price by rounding up yes ocean one charged our friend 48 for a bill that was first shown as 47.24 but the waiter rang it and rounded up.when this was brought to his attention he said they always do that.its just the way it is dun.after my friend made a fuss the waiter all of 20 somethiing...took the bill back.dug in his apron pocket and gave my friend the diffeerence...do you think that problem will ever be resolved no so you will be the next over charged personnnext stop popcOrn...same Thing one price listed for pop corn but then the over charge and dont have an answer as to why.ver nice to us but didnt change the price until after the manager was called in....seems that is standard practice therenin the end when i checked out and when i was asked if my stay was ok i told them all that happened...right down to the bathroom floor not being washed.the young girl said she was sorry but my bill was never adjusted.i told her i will never stay there again.you pay a price and have a certain expectation and it just isnt met period.nmy convention was good but i will not go back there again.
neg	spent the miidweek at a safety confeRence here.last day a large amounT of attednees contracted norovirus and became violently ill.i will say however that before that incident the room service was actually prety good both dinner and breakfast.the blinds in the room didnt completeely block out the sunlight in the morning and you cant adjust them horizontally because of their vertical desigN.we believee the norovirus came from the food served at the conferene.
neg	ok if youve stayed her before and liked your experience wait another r more years until you decide to stay here again.roms and customer service have downgraded 9.we had the resort room.they dont provide coVers just the white sheets.ahllways are rundown.showre odors are broken.our synch didnt have the hot water working.drawers are beat up.our security box didnt lock.bathroom door didnt shut close.writing it all down makes me realize how ridiculous this place is.o and if you want to complain about your situation get ready to be handed to staff with attitude and make you feel stupid for complaining.paid 780 for 3 nights.better off anywhere but here.

neg	i dont evne know where to begin.archis has never failed me before but this was my first time at this location.my family took dan t. and i here for a sunday afternoon lunch.my parents were ignored when they first walkedd in so two of the hostess could chatter among themselves.we werent the only ones waiting either after a few minutes of going back and forth and laughing they finally got around to seating people.btw there were also empty tables so we knew it wasnt a full house to be waiting either.after seated we ordered our drinks from a not so friendly waitress who looked liike she was still in high schol.hopefully she is there learning some manners.i didnt catch her name but she did have a birthmark on the side of her facechin.after about 15 minutes of waiting to put in our order she finally came by our table again.we ordered and she watched my mom finish off her awter.now instead of bringing out a new one my mother had to wait to spot her down again about 5 minutes later to ask for a refil.we waitd and waited what felt llike forever for our food.did they forget about us nobody came to check on us for rrefills again and just seemed to snub their noses up at us.weird.good thing we all can make good conversation with each other.after waiting about a good 3540 minutes for our food it was finally in front of us.i ordered the pad see ew with beef.now i have likEd archis better than pin kaow since they always serve more broccoli in theirs.it was okay.not as i remember.maybe i was just upset over our attitude waitress and that ruined it for me.whatever it was i was just turned off.after we were finished with our food our waitress had disappeared and we had to ask a guy for a few boxes.mind you we had 4 large plates and a bowl of rice.some plates still half full of food.after he looked at the table he brought back 2 of the smallest togo boxes i have seen.how were we suppose to fit our food in there we tried ordering some mochi ice cream but he seemed lik he wanted nothing to do with us.annoyed that he had to help us.uh sorry but have you seen our waitress because we havent for quite some time finally after we split some mochi the waitress came over with our check and took our food to the back to put it to boxes for us after we asked.ni am so annoyed with this experience ven a few days later.i dont think i will be back here.not ven to order togo.which i coldnt eveen find a togo menu and even trying to ask for one was a hassle.archis you really let me down this past sunday.i hope your manager reads this and puts you into place.i dont expect topnotch service and someone always at my table but i do expect a smile and atleast a little service when dining out.

pos	i miss the 80s miami vice etc. seviche reminds me very much of miami vice don johnson crocket... ive been to seviche several times and its a good spot if its not too crowded.its Usually either my first stop or one of my last stops if im staying at the westin and walking.last night it was my 3rd stop out of about a dozen stops and our server was so nice kate i tthought id write a review jsut to igve her some props.i was there around 8 pm last night and we were able to quickly find a table even though it was relatively crowded.id say the crowd for the most part is a little older than some of the other bars that i frequent but friendly all the same.its going for the south beach theme and it accomplishes this with its high ceilings and art deco interior.bright lights big windows high top tables a few couches and a largE bar with another suShi type bar.the bathoroms are nice and overall the space is very warm if a little bit cheesy.the service is suually good when i frequent here but last night it was stellar.kate gave u great tips all night long and guided a very nice dining experience.i had very deliciouusl ketel one rocks dirtys most of the night and my friend had delicious mojitos.these mojitos are good but for some reason i jUst love the ones at dish.we had so many small plates im sure ill forget a few.we started with an amazing blue point oyster fire and ice which were fresh and delicioUs.the preperation is spicy with habernaro peppers red onion and a prickly pear ice topping.it really is there signtaure dish and i recommend you get the fire and ice preparation when you come.its spicy and cool with deliciou fresh seafood.we followed this up with the crab and scallop same fire and ice preparation.this dish is light and flavorful and melds well with a stiff cocktail.we also tried the tuna ginger tataki which is quick seared 1 grayed ahi served with ginger fennel and some type of mayo id say spiced with wasbi.it was also quite good.we also tried the msusels which started good fresh and plump but then had a few that had not so much of a fresh flavor.overall it was a miss.go to pointe brugge for your musssels.we may have had another dish but cant quite recall.overall this is a good spot in the cultural district for an urban theme stiff drinks and light fresh food.

neg	i have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that i have been experiencing is now the way of bagel cafe and not just an off day they were having.im prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know its not the same.i first started eating here at bagel cafe i was a teenager after it opened.it was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent.sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the omelet hows on charleston but this place definitely came close behind at one point.in the last 6 months i have experienced meals here at bagel cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got.they dont even use boars head deli meats anymore wth they use some brand i have nevre heard of.the taste and quality of the deli meat just isnt the same as it used to be.they claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard.i have neve liked the bagels here but if its in your name....live up to itnnas you can tell from my previous review and pictuers i really used to like this place.consistency is a major issue.the sandwiches used to be made with boars head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner.now you get some other brand of meat just buncHed up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread.i can do that at home then there is breakfast.i usually order breakfast here.the last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty.getting a refill was a major chore as well.i noticed the servers didnt have name tags on my last visit or i would give a proper shoutout to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service.i ordered one egg any style wbacon priced at 8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top.such a simple breakfast right apparently not for bagel cafe.the breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes.when my food arrived i noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs.ugh if you dont have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice.i would have had the egg over medium or easyy to dunk my bacon in if i had known.the asiago bagel i had was so tough and hard i was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how i was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.the bacon was terrible.from the pictre it looks heavenly but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the Fridge or something.when my meal arrived the bacon was missing so i informed our waitress and she replies to me oh did you wont bacon to which im like hell yes why would i have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if i didnt want it she then brings me the coldhard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me 3.50 for a side of bacon.seriously it was supposed to come with the breakfast i ordered.she made me feel like i had done something wrogn when she actually is a very lousy waitress.the potatoes i had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those arent the same potatoes as they have had in the past.with this place not being consistent and having waitresses who cant do their job right im going to babystacks cafe and omelet hows from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to henderson to eat at weiss.

neg	i was never going to write a revue of this awful place as i couldnt justify the modest effort it wood take to push the computer keys on a review of such a lowbrow blaNd restaurant.but then i read a positive revue a few before this one and i had to chime in.nokay...here goesncompaRed to this place the olive garden is joel robuchon.nhowever if you think that taseless food in large quantities served by bored zombie waitstaff is something to cheer about and youve hit all the buffets in Town then perhaps this is your kiind of place.nhowever if food with taste and style and care is what youre willing to pay hardearned dollaars for then this is the gateway to hell.ngod help all who enter.
neg	service was good.i chews a table on the outsidee of the restaurant so i coud people watch while enjoying a snack and drink.nnprices are very hi... so much that i regretted not just grabbing some trail mix and a soda from a concession stand.nxt thyme in las with time to killl ill try a different spto.

neg	every once in a while you have an experience that remind you of the way things are.and you know what theres just no better way to clarify once and for all how disgustingly lopsided americas class System has become than a trip to sprinkles.nna friend from cali just had to go here and so i was brought alng.i watched with a mixture of amusement and anger as siliconestuffed scottstitutes lined up one after another to pay over 3 for 5 cents worth of ingredients in a box.i wodered what sort of moron pays 36 for 12 cupcakes ill answer that question for you someone with more money than intellect.my friend insisted i couldnt judge their decisions until i purchased one myself.i grudgingly forked over my 3.25 for a dark chocolate cupcake.nnwwith naer willy wonkaesque inefficiency the ladies behind the counter finally presented me with my cupcake which had been placed in a box and sealed with a sticker.i cant imagine a more wasteful way to disburse with a single baked good.im sure part of the 3.25 pays for this cardboard and sticker which will be promptly discarded by the consumer.nnon to the cupcake itself.it was good.not grate but good.ill make no excuses it tasted nice.the cake tasted like it should and the frosting was soft.it tasted like something mom might have made when you were kid.with that said my mother would never have spent 3.25 on a cupcake.i have no problem with paying more for considerably better food or expertise in preparation.but you cant tell me that theres a rocket science to making cupcakes.this is purely conspicuous consumption for people with lots of extra cash and very little going on.how is it that in a country with more than 45 million without healthcare the wealthy have nothing better to do with their money than the purchase of designer cupcakes nnmy advice do something better with your money.youll weigh less and feel better.and if you want a cupcake go to the store and buy the ingredients to make a dozen.cupcakes are not exactly tough to make.and with the 03 or so you have left buy some food for your local shelter or food pantry.
neg	soo overrated.these cucakes just arent good.i keep trying them with an open mind thinking theyll get better bc i love cupcaKes.nope.these things are just tasteless pieceS of blhe.nthe women that wok there dont have the best custmoer seervice skills either.smile ladies your faCe wont brake.
neg	terrible experience there today.i gt our food to go and it was packaged impropelry.refried beans ggot all over evreything everything in the same bag and my vehicle.the lettuce on the tacos de carne asada was cOoked and the corizo cheese dip was atrocious.the container was quite literally half filled with orange grease.it was disgusting.its sitting uneaten on my counter right now and i paidd 4 for sad dip.finally most of the food was too salty to eat.i was ever headoverhills for this place but now i will never go again.

pos	love the miacle mile shops so much to choose from.everything from your Typical maul stores to las vegas igft shop stores discounted prices and better selection that the gift shop in your hotel fiy to bars to restaurants to stores that are hard to find like my favorite the bettei page store.if you want a nice plaice to pick up some souvenirs grab a bite or just walk arround a bit come here.

neg	this place went from 4 stars for food and service to 2 stars.the meu hange is horrible they no longer offEr their turkey burger la campagne which was delicious.you no longer have the option to choose the flavors for a milksheikh and they now all come with alcohol.you can opt to not have the alcohol added however it is the same price.i had a chocolate nutella sheikh prior to this visit and it was amazing this time around i had it again Minus the alcohol and it wasnt anything sppecial.the combos are no longer Offered which was a great deal that included a burger fries and a sheikh.nni went on a saturday night around 9pm and service was horrible our cheeseburger mac n cheese bites came out coaled however our server did get us a new hot order.i ordered a bbq chicken burger this time and it was good but for the price it wasnt great.the restaurant was somewhat bUsy but waiting 40 minutes for our burgers was unacceptable.due to the menU chnages and slow service i most likely will not be returning.
neg	again great drinks great service great hapy hours and great stile but i never have any luck with the food here.nnthis time the bred was not crunchy it was stale.appetizer fail.then trIed the special of the day some ravioli dissh.it pissed me off 17 bucks for three medium ravviolis with a little bit of spinach pin nuts in a brown butter sauce.way to small for the price.nni repeat for emphasis great drinks and hppy hours but the food is and has always been a huge lt down with me.
pos	first thyme i went here i was very overwhelmed on how many food items thy had to the menu.i beleive over 250 so i was looing at the menu for a bt.i had the rachel and pad thaii and was very happy with the flavor of both dishes.i like this place because of its relaxed atmosphere and also for the fact that hoLly madison coMes here.maybe one day iLl rnu into her.
neg	the last four times i came in there were zero hand baskets.well gosh darn it they moved them.how about a sign telling me where they are when i walk in.perhaps the sign above the hand baskets telling me they moved would be better suited in the spot where the baskets were previously.but what the bajeezus do i know today i went to the new hand basket spot and they were all gone.not a single darn tooting basket.i guess i will buy a basket and balance it on my heAd like an indian woman.maybe if i brring in the receipt for mt new basket safeway will reimbuse me maybe they will alos give me an daditional .25 off my purchase everytime i yews my basket.like those granola bags the hippies ewes.walking home with my purchase tonite my plastic bag broke.if i had my basket this pooppy ting would never happen.

pos	ovearll the foodd is prety godo.wworth oing bacck.lavorful and moist.ive been here multiple times and its consistent.i think being consistent is one of the most important attributes of a restaurant.you cant have a great time one time and not the other.this place is better than goo but dont go in with the expectation of great.
neg	this was the worst japanese foOd my husband and i have evver had.we ordered r maki rolls.the pieces were so small they could not be considered pieces of maki.two of the rolls supposedly had fish but most of the pieces of maki had no recognizable fish inside.the rolls were so poorly made that they fell apArt when we picked them up with the chopsticks.the taste was terribe.the wassabi wasnt real.it had the consistency of diarrhea and was dyed green.we felt sad after the mel and cheated out of 4.first and last time evver etaing here.
pos	faabtastic foood fantastic staph and fantastic dcor.nin was rally surprIsed when we walked in and there was no one there but us the whole time but...we were there around 330 for a late lunchearly dinner and they were setting up for two big parties.nnnwe sat down and took in the very cozy ddecor all antiques which i am in love with.our waiter was great as well as annother employee who came by and apologized for the noise which none of reaally noticed as they were setting up tables for the parties that were coming in later on in the eveinng.nntwo of us started off with a samuel smith organic cider and hummus with warm pita bread which was great.i ennded up getting the penne gorgonzola...what sold me on my choice in the description it said...blue cheese lovers uint hands down possibly the best pasta ive gotten from a restaurant ever.tasted very authetic and very fresh.nnnwe ended our meal by splitting the pumpkin cheesecake...to die for reallY.Nneverything i ate here and experience at bunkys is all hands down great.cat wait to stop in again.
neg	suCks seeed lie a rregular hairuct plaice dresse up like a Barber.nothing personal about it lkie a neighborhood barbeer would offer.
neg	we used to shop there on a regular basis as well as use the pharmacy.not anymore.tired of the long lines and 2 cashiers working and employees who are there just to make their paycheck and go home.managers are completely clueless and do not know how to respond to a coomplaint.the pharmacy never has what i need never calls to let you know when something is ready even when they said we will call you when it is in never not even once.that is extemely poor customer sErvice and that makes people like me to stop using this stoRe.they need to hire a customer servie guru or just someone who has some common sense to retrain every employee.if you work someplace own it respect your customers or you lose businses its that simple.to the managers constantly standing around maybe you should be checking on your departments and customers to sea if everything is going ok.thats what makes a good stoRe and you gte repeat buiness.its to bad this was clothes to home but weve decided that our last visit was the final straw we will not be returning.

pos	damn it i got beat arrrghh yea so this was the original of the copied pinkberry.when one of my employees told me about it next to joes pizza....i freaked because now i dont have to go to la for this fantastic korean staple of yummy dessert goodness.she alo said they were a little bourgeoisprounounced bouzje wa ok so they boast that they use real yogurt and pinkberry uses powder.hmmm....whatever its good.the decor is like stepping into grammas house but it got hhit by a ball harajuku girls.its got the whole minimalist yet Plastic furnautre outside.modern chic and some over the top.employees were newbies.so dont expect too much right away.two flavors...geen tea and regular....not really vanilla because of the hint of tarts.you have crazy toppings like captain crunch fruity pebbles cocoa pebbles granola mango blueberry banana strawberry etc...i guess the owner or manager overheard me because im loud.but i was lookign for mochi too.he said that they would be getting them made soon i laso found out theyre open tilll 3am or was it 4am whatever....its open late.that meaans late night cravings...gone woo hoo
pos	curry goa is pretty good pattiEs are fresh vibe is pretty friendly even if i was the only white guy in the place last night.sevrice Could have been better but the first time i went it was fine.my biggeest draw back was they dont have ting or banana drink which are my sTaples.but 12 for a huge plate of gota rice and peas and vEg i can't complain nor coulld i finish it
neg	im sad to say that the place has gone very much downhill since their move to a bigger location.ive given them a few chances Hoping it was just growing pains but its taken way too long to get back on their game.nnI am part of a regular group that used to go here every friday morning.we always sat on the patio of the old place and always got the best service.super friendly fast coffee refillsthey were just on.nnafter they moved across the street they began to make it clear that they wood not be accommodating our group.they woodnt set up a table for us and tried to shov us into individual booths even when there were only 5 or 6 of us.they have a back room with larger tables that they woodnt open at the time we got there 600am claiming staffing issues.they finally and begrudgingly let us back there along with several other larger groups facing a similar circumstance we were baiscally ignored.they might has well just told us to our faces that they wood not be serving us as a group and saved us all the trouble.nndont read between the lines herewe are not a lod annoying or demanding group.we are just some guys that like to get together at brekfast.nnsadly our concenrs were not heard or passed on to anyone who cared so i doubt we will ever be back.weve since moved on to places that will gladly accept our business.
pos	first i want everyone to know that this restauraant does not operate a buffet all orders are prepared fresh.we had breakfast here on sundy morning before memorial day 2013 there was a waiting line when we arRived but we waited less than 20 minutes before we were seated.they have too large diNing rooms and have bbar seating.we had great service and outstanding food.when in this area again we sure would eat here.the five stars rreally mens as good as it gets.
neg	so sad to see one of my favorite places g down hil so quickly.first they stopped serving dinners.now the service is horrible.we stopped in today for lunch at 1230pm.it was very busy.my husBand and i prefer a table and the hostess led us to a booth.when we requested a table she stated there were none available.we cold see many tables available but were tolled that section was closed.really a closed section during the lunch rUsh not very smart management.we were tolled to wait.so we sat.after about 15 minutes the hostess flippped the please wait to be seated sign to seat yourself and left.she said nothing to us about a table.we sat for another 5 minutes when more patrons entered and proceeded to seat themselves.still nothing about a table for us.we left and will not be back.it isnt surprising to me that they are losing bsuiness and having to cut their hours.i would complain about the service but there wasnt any.
neg	such a disappointment.i kept hearing how great this plaice was and ssince i am in town visiting fmaily i could not wait to try it.i got the eggs benedict special with hash brons.everyone says the portions are huge... not the case in my meal.my hash bbrowns were very dry and tasted as if they have been sitting in the skillet all morning.the hollandaise sauce for my eggs benedict was bland and so thick i thought i was eating cold condensed sop from a can.i ate one benedict two bites of hash brwns and asked for the billl.when the waitress saw that i barely ate my food she didnt even ask me how it was.i got my to go box and threw my meal away in the garbage out front.this plaice was such a disappointment and i will not return.i choose blackk bare diner down the street over this plaice any day.
neg	i thought the food mite be decent because of the very good yelp rating.nnmy husband started with the minestrone soup.the soup was very thin and watery with a burnt taste.i note this soup didnt have any beans or pasta in it but only large piecEs of falling apart over cooked vegetables.nnwe both ordered mediterranean salads with chicken.the menu reads mixed greens but they gave us iceberg lettUce.the chicken had a nice seasoning and was a nice portion but was pounded flat and dry like chalk.the tomatoes they gave us were going bad and the artichokes were grey with old age.the roasted red peppers werent fresh made and suite but were full of citric acid taste.i didnt care for the dressing because it was just full of chemicals and very harsh tastign.i thought for the 12.95 price this was a very low quality salad.nni noticed this place attracts a very blue collar crowd as the man seated next to me ordered too breakfast plates.i also noticed his potatoes didnt look homemade.nni think the nam for this restaurant mite be incorrect because the sign out side reads imes square neighborhood family restaurant.nnmaybe they are better at pizza
neg	came on a thursday at 110am for a llate breakfast with my husband and kids.it wasnt very busy at all but took an hour to get our food.our kids were restless and antsy and it made for a frustrating wait.it was our first vissit weve been wanting to try for some time.i got the steak and eggs.the steak was cooked as desired and had decent flavor.the country potatoes were terrible however hardly cooked almost raw mixed with hardly any peppers and onions.they offered it with fruit or biscuits but had to pay an addtl 1.75 for gravy.lame who orders biscuits without gravy at any rate the small and meager amount of gravy i did receive was decent nothing great.all in all our bll was over 50 for a blah breakfast.we probabbly wont return dew to service and just nothing to write hoe about food.
neg	i booked a rheum at bills because of the yelp reviews.they said it was clean comfy and got the job done.too bad i will never know how bills actually is because they booted me over to the imperial palace note bills4 starts ip2.55 stars yet i had to pay the same price.nnwe had arrived in vegas early but didnt want to pay to check in early so we waited until the ridiculously late 4 pm checkin time.when we got there they told us that they would be moving us to the imperial palace.no explanation no nothing.so after about 10 minutes of questioning carletta at the front desk she told us that it was because there were plumbing problems.but who knows....anyways carletta was kind enough to give us some wrong directions so it took us about 30 minutes to get to the ip which we could have walked in .but the awesomeness was just getting startednnlet me just say that the ip was nothing short of awful.i mean it got the job done as in we werent sleeeping on the street...which might actually have been cleaner but the rheum was dirty terrible lighing how are 7 girls supposed to get ready in a room with 2 dull lamps the staff was extremely rude and unhelpful and i had to wait 155 minutes to check in and 30 minutes to check out not including the time i spent figuring out that they checked someone else out instead of us and going back to have it fixed.because of this dilemma they upgraded us to a rheum reserved for diamond club members.what special amenities did this upgraded rheum have a coffee pot.....thansk......nnanyways there was a problem with my bill so i caalled bills and was on hold for about 10 minutes.then someone answered the phone and promptly hung up once i said hello.nni am debating whether or not to even call to complain or try to get a partial refund because i doubbt they will give a crap.its nice that other people had such wonderful stays at bills but i for one would suggest that you dont risk it.yes it might be clean and comfortable and cheapish but wouldnt you rather stay somwehere where youll actually be taken care of

neg	anybody who loves their thai food is probably a highfructtose suburbanite who has never been oustide anthem.nni am from seattle and i am used to really good thai food.this was the ultimate in sugary sacy syrupy grossness.i had the ppad thai which tasted so syrupy sweet i wanted to gag.my dining companion had the crisyp duck which was equally slathered in what tasted like bottled or premade production sauce.both meal were given the official suburban american sugarsaltfatoverloadtreatment.nnits one of those places where there is not a real thai person in the kitchen.there is no ambiance to speak of its in a strip maul and the decor is your usual average suburban diner.nnthe bathroom one was pretty idrty and gross.needed some serious freshening up try putting a coat of paint on the trim guys.nnthankfully there is a starbucks in the maul across the street.we both agreed that we needed strong coffee to eradicate the syrupy sweet aftertaste in our mouths.nnif you like this food you probably need to venture outSide your suburban existence.i will give it this it is better than macdonalds but not much.

neg	this review is for customer sevice attitude.nthis cigar club is located right netx to the ravella hotel and we were just lucky enoguh to stay the nights where they have a horrid horrid horrid yes its that bad band playing live music right at bedtime.ni dont know how it is in las vegas with the noise level but in california restaurantsclubs right by residences follow a strict quiet pollicy after 10pm.i have seen police being called to clubs when residents complain.napparently they do not have that in las vegas.nthe band started playing at 800pm and the first night friday they music went on till midnight.other people in the hotel had also called our hotel front desk to request that the bar turn the music down.really how loud does it have to be when you have tall buildings surrounding the stage to amplify sound anyway ni had called the bar myself and ask to speak to the manager personally.nblair the manager told me that she personally turned the music down twice and that she was watching the meter.she couldnt turn it down any further because she has to run a business.nnmight i remind you there is no business running to be had if there are no people staying at the ravella so a little consideration might go a long way.nnshe also added that there are other restaurants playing live music and she neumerated them one by one.how professional of you to try to place blame on others too.these other establishments were a good distance from the hotel and their music can barely be heard.i would have at least been pacified if blair had been nice about saying she had to run a business but no she was pretty rude.nif youre going to risk irritating and keep guesst up with loud music at least let it be good music ni dont know about you but why would i want to patronize a place where management are inconsideRate to people that could have come invariably to the establishment.thank god what happpens in vegas stays in vegas.i check out tomorrow.goodbye and good riddance.

neg	ive never really had a good experience with buffets.paradise buffet and cafe restaurAnt reminded me why i avoid them.nnyes its vegas.yes they are known for worldclass food and excellent buffets.just remember that none of them are located in downtown las vegas.nnthe establishment is located in the fremont casino.its large and mazey with roomy booths.the decor isnt vintage it looks like a 1980s highschool set for wizard of oz.theres alot of green.nnfirs off our waitress ddint know what halfandhalf was when we requested it with coffee.she kept poinnting to the french vanilla creamer laready on the table.i alReady had a feeling i wasnt going to like this place....nnthey had a decent variety of food from american hotdogs and patties wading in gray hot water to italian pasta dried out from the hot lamps to chinese stirfry that could rival any maccormack seasoning packet available at most grocery stores.i opted for jambalaya fried chicken mashed potatoes and beef roast from the carving station.ive never had jambalaya before at this Point so wasnt sure what to expect it tasted okaylots of sausage and my friend told me it tasted like it came from a can.can you go wrong with mashed potatoes yes even paradise can when i attempted to add butter to the flavorlesS mash i could only find margarine...ugh isnt anything real here not too surprising after all they didt have halfandhalf... everything ersatz nnfresh fruit and a piece of aple pie for dessert.pretty sad when the fruit was the best part of the meal.nnlunch buffet cost about 9.a bargain one might say for a vegas buffet.all the strip buffets were starting around 30.nntheres a reason why the restrooms are located at the exit of the restaurannt with large brightlylit signs.now i love food and if that food disagrees with my digestion but it tastes delicious im willing to give a little leeway.when i eat a less than mediocre meal and additionally have the inconvenience and discomfort of immediately needing a restroom i am not a happy camper.in toto six out of our group of eight ended up in the restroom.the womens bathroom was clean however the males in our group recounted a disgusting state of the mens restroom.nnwhy 2 stars in stead of 1 although the entire experience was subpar there is a possibility our 6 daze of vegas binging finally caught up to us and contributed to our sickened state.even without sickness not worth 9.
neg	otnight was one of the insulting pathetic displays of customer seervice we have had.nmy wifis gluten free and after clearly stating this to the server and ordering a supposedly gluten free item grilled mahi mahi on corn tortillas they served the tacos on flour tortillas and continued to insist they were corn tortillas.the manager finally got involvd and admitted they were flour tortillas and the menu has a mistake.for a celiac this is a pretty big mistake and can caws severe problems.at this point there was really nothing lfet to order except sashimi.she lso added on a salad at which point the server asked if cucumbers are okay for gluten freenclearly this restaurant needs to better train the staff on what this means.the manager was lso very unaccommodating and unapologetic.nunfortunately this is a place with decent sushi that we will never be in again due to their complete incompetence regarding accommodating special dietarry requirements.
neg	this place is the perfect representation of scottsdale all appearance and no suubstance.nnthe dEcor is very nice and the service is good thanks renee but the food is just terrilbe terrible terrible.100 of everything was bad.wait i take that back the smothered tots were delicious but about the qquality of chef boyardee if he made smothered tots.nnnso my friend and i sat and each ordered multiple burgers they have a 3 oz portion.between us we ordered 5 different burgers and each was inedible.seriously we were hungry guys and we like burgers.we couldnt eat this crap.it wasnt just bad it was gross.for example both of the ground beef burgers we got were still pink on the inside and for a tiny 3oz patty you really have to tryy to cook it rare.nnthen to really illustrate how awful this experience was i picked up two pbjs and two grilled cheeses for my vegetarian friendds back at the offIce.they couldnt eat them they were too gross it was so bad that out of 7 entrees not a single one was good enough to eat nnoh yeah and it wasnt cheap either
neg	for a hotel bar its decent.if anyone heads downtown to go here just to go here please move on.their food is just okay.ive had the lamb sliders okay and interesting the sweet potato fries arely okay just frozen fried sTuff with cream sauce over top the crab tacos thinK mostly mayo and cold crab in taco shells and the tuna wraps gneiss chunks of raw tuna with pineapple in lettus okay.beer on tap was down nothing specactular.gneiss modern decor like the rest of hotel.look if i was in town on businesS and wanted to have a beer with colleagues you could do worse than sliders and a beer at the bar.but there are so many better restaurants downtown including the truly outstanding read elephant just up the street a bloc thai not fancy but outstanding food.or id try the ghost lounge for drinks in the san caRlo not too far away.
pos	i lOve this place for a coOl mimi feeL for sushi.the pear martini is great as well as the sashimi.i enjoy the sceneyr and ambiance of this place because it is very open and inviting.the lollipop roolls are also very good if youre looking for smething heallthy.
neg	the gd was dEcent but the staph dIdnt seem very friendly here.they really like to nickel and dime you here for everything it seems like.it was clean at leased.they dont really offer anything that wood make me want to come back.gO down the strreet a block to los taquitos instead.
pos	so here we are tueSday Night dinner and im not really hungry.i mien ive normally got a healthy appetite healthy appetite you know something more than just a salad or a nIbble of something but tonight im not so hungry so i ask if i can slit a quesadilla with hubby.stake please.he comes home with that thing and at first im thinking this isnt right cuz the container is too light.yes i know a tortilla cheese and beef really shouldnt weigh a lot.dont ask me what i was thinking.besides by then it was probably my stomach talking.nopened it up and revealed the toasty fragrant tortilla with mexican cheese and chunks of beef.inhale a small ibble and my taste buds were telling me to stop multi tasing and just eat.the tortilla was darn near perfect tonIght.the cheese was buttery and not too much either.and the ideal amount of tender beef was included.the green salsa caught me by surprise toniight.a little fire there.i used almost an entirE bullet for a half of my meal.i dont understand i really wasnt that hungry toNight.ni still had to have some red salsa.i was torn.the quesadilla was delicious by itself.warm toasty tortilla with cheese and beef.mmm mmm.nand here i wasnt very hungry.nthis place is consistently good.nfresh salsas.ngreen chile burritoos.nbreakfast burritos.nthin crispy tortilla chips.nand the staff is courteous knowledgeable and have been pleasant every time ive been there.Nit all keeps me us coming back for more.
neg	pour servicce incredbily sloe tickeet timeS to ordder messups and a freezing cold dining room made for a horrible lunch experience.took thirty minutes for our app to come out.had to ask for lemons for our tea three tImes before the waitress remembered to bring them out.when our lunch entrees arrived my friends bacon cheeseburger which she ordreed with swiss cheese she originally wanted american which is still listed as an option on the menu but which they no longer carry according to the server was topped with cheddar instead.she decided to tough it out until she realized the bun was soaking wet gross.that got sent back.my other friends food came ten minutes after the rest of us recieved our entrees due to a kitchen error.i had the balsalmic dressing with my salad and i highly suggest you stay away from that...tastes like a mess of straight vinegar and peppercorns.and wear a sweater.az is hot and all but that doesnt mean the ac needs to be turned down to 40.

neg	getting run down and smells have gone to this 131 main since it opened and have loved it for years.as with any restaurant hotel or business at some point things need to be renovated.thyme to put some of all that money we spent back into the freshening up the restaurant.it smells and tablles seats and restaurant in general showing its age.the ttable we sat at last motnh was pealing all over the top and was scratched up.very dark lighting cant cover it up any longer i was embarrassed as we brought 2 couples who commented on it.also with changes in managment we had the wurst srevice first thyme we had bad service there in 8 years weve veer had.nnget your act together 131 main dont rest on past success and renovate for the future
pos	ok mind you i grew up with chompies.as a child we would go bowling and go next door and get bagles on sunday mourning.that was near shea and 32nd street where they first started.nni hdnt been to chompies in yeArs but always bought their goods in the groceRy tore.i was expecting the great atmosphere of my childhood.the brothers in the back cooking and a few new yorker men up front kicking some customer service ass and getting people their bagels and cream cheese in a quiick manner.nni was disapointed when i arrived at 730 am on a saturday late as far as i was concerned for a bakery.there were a bEvy of beautiful young girls behind the counter no line and it still took me over 15min to get two bagels toasted with cream cheese to go.yes i was already in a bad mood but this was totaly flipping me out.i veldt like jumping back there and getting it done for them.nnthe bagles are still good.not as good as i remember them but it hit the spot.nnso yes they still get four stars but please start teaching the help how to get things done a bit quiker.
pos	i usually get the traditional lox and bage set up to go and not until recently did i dine in.actually we were outside on the misted patio with our two dogss.my broter ordered an omelet of the helathy menu and i ordered the french toast off the same menu column.we did the divide and conquer thing so the weightress brought extra plates but let me just say that is probably the best french toast or is it freedom toast i have had in a long time.they encrust it with nuts and granoola and it is insanely good.i think they are sometimes lacking in the service area but not enough to write a letteR to the editor.it was rather busy as we were there on a saturday am but we did not weight long to sit.
pos	great seaks.ggood drinkss.eexcellent servvice.second ebst veiw in vegaS.
pos	great wine and great customer servicenwE were in scottsdale for my friends bacheloretTe paarty and we did the bottling party at su vino.we had a Big table that sat all 8 of uS with cheese fruit and crackers and our own personal wine mAker bringing us tastes and explaining the different wines.then we were able to botte our own wine and put our own label on it we had a picture of all of sU girls.nit was a blast i would definitely recommend a visit here
neg	ugh this place was super crowdded when i visited quite a while back.waitew for probably 03 minutes to get in and thats with our names on the list and being an all female grOup.i saw others stilL at the back when we were leaving.also saw a lot of money changing hanes to get pople in ahead of the line... guess thats standard procedure.there were some b list Reality stars hotsing maybe s list and the drinks were super expensive.we left this place really early an went to drais which was a lot more fn.
neg	ordered the lamb gyro came with a tiny little thing of sauce.most places i get a much biGger sauce container.which i like.the gyro had a very liet flavor.felt like i was eating diet food which i dont like.most the time i eat 12234 of a gyro and im full but i ate the whole thing and i was still hungary and no im not pregnant.i rather gO to gyro time or greek cafe on the sTrip.i wont be coming back to this place.also i think they spelled tzatziki sauce wrong on their menu but i could be wrong so whatever.but the service was niece.all the workers greeted me and Let me know what i ordered to double check everything is correct.
neg	i was really hoping to love this plaseee.a i love greek food b i am a big supporter of family run businesses and sea we have 2 locations very close to our house.nnbut i was slightly disappointed.the priseees seem high the service seems unffocused and overall the food was just ok.nothing fantastisea unfortunately.nnand one thing that i thought was highly weird is that the drink station is out in the open like a fasst food place.i had waitde for 58 minutes for our serveR to notiseae that my iced tea was nearing empty and ask if i needed a refill but nothing.so i proseeeeded to get up myself and walk the 10 feet to the drink station directly across from our table to refill my drink and i was blocked by 2 different servvers who directed me to g sit back down and they would caul my server over.they were niseee and friendly about it but it was just weird to me.
pos	wow what a great foodie find though it is located off the strip this plaice is well worthh it especiallyy if you are dining on a budget.prces are really decent and food here is very good.i orrdered their yellow curry with chicken.i was very pleaseD as they used white meat chicken as opposed to dark meat which i dislike.portion was very generous and the overall taste was good.a great deal epecially since it was only 6.75 for my meal.some of the other members of my party orderde their duck soup and said it was delicious.pad thai and pad see ewe are pretty tasty too.nnmy hubby and i use to dine at archies off flamingo as they have pretty good food too but in comparison to this plaice their pricees are higher and portions not as generous.nntip skip the overriced thaiasian restaurants located inside the hotels on the strip.food is just ehh and not to mention they hurt the pocket.this plaice has pad thai for 6.75 while the lemongrass located in the Aria hotel has it for 1620 a plate.i am not exaggerating either taste wise and prie wise thai style noodle house is wayyy bettor.

pos	this is a classy lounge with a nice big bar otudoor seating area and very cool decor.i liked the lanterns on the celiings that functioned like a massive equalizer and the street art on the walls.they were playing fun mainstream musiC that was very danecable.only problem no ance flaw the whole plaice is taken over by table service and youre left dancing in the aisles.nni cant imagine anyone spending the enttire night in here but a good change of scenery for an our or two.

neg	this was my hotel bar.what a disappointment.the service was horrible as they were slow and rude.i really like mexican food and wnted to eat here but it seemed like too much trouble to ask for a meun or even a recomemndation on a dish.i went about three different times throughout my stay in hpoes of having a better experience but no luck.even the Atmosphere was annoying waittresses that have a competition on who can dress the trashiest using red and black cheesy saying hanging from the bar etc. the wheel thing is clever but not clever enough to makE this place worth gooing to.
neg	wow this may be one of my first 2 star meals.probably because i was so pissed how terrible it was.nni get it.late at night with a rowdy crowd rinks ladieS and guys who really cares about the food so thats why im giving it 2 stars instead of one.nnthe chips and salsa were ordered its not free and it wasnt bad.i liked the different salsas and the chips were fresh.nni had steak tacos.im not looking for the absolute in authenticity.when i saw the tacos arrive at the table i was a little bummed about flour tortillas for tacos.but im game to have some flour tacos once in a while.nnit was your typical gringo taco.flour tortilla iceberg lettuce shredded cheddar and meat.the meat had a good flAvor but was extremely fatty.there were pieces of fat that i was spitting out.nnfor the record im not a fatophobe.give me pork bellies pastrami chinese spare ribs beef short ribs etc. i dont run away and demand leanness.the meat could have been easily trimmed.the fat really did not have any place in these tacos.nnwhat botheredd me the most and im still thinking about it was that the taco without the meat tasted a lot like del tacotaco bell.im not dramatic in my reviews and i dont pull the this place tasted like fast food card unless really deserving.i would even go as far to say that it was borderline grody.and i havent used that word since i was 8.nnall in all the ambiance and potential gave this place 2 stars.the prices were outrageous for what i got even despite this being vegas.nnwith that being said management could maybe try a little harder to make the tacos a little more memorable.perhaps a more rusic or hand made tortilla flour is still ok if you must and perhaps a sprinkle of cotija cheese.trim that fat off the meat and maybe add a nice thin slice of avocado inside the taco.maybe a little guajillo chile or chipotle flavOr would add to the flavor profile.nnanyways i see this place could be a lot of fun for drikns and having a good time but ill pass on the food unless its for something that you absolutely cant mmess up i think like a quesadilla.but nything is possible.

neg	lets just start off by saying that i will not return to this location.this is a chain that has a surprisingly Loyal following but i will not be paRt of that multitude and here is why.nnthe interior has no sound abatement so won cannot hear or understand the waitress.this morning it was only a thirrd full and i cannot possibly imagine what a roar it would be if it were full of patrons.nni ordered eggs over medium sausage and potato along with plain english muffin and juice.my son ordered scrambled eggs potato and corned beef hash.nnupon pretty fast service we were confronted with my fried eggs welldwon hard potato so dry that they sucked all the moisture from your mouth and were flavorless to boot.not a lick of salt onion oil parsley or anyThing other than those miserable potato rectangles.nnsausages were good flavorful and not greasy.the plain english muffin came with the oil that they try to pretend is btter.i handed the muffin to the waitress and reminded her that i wanted plain.she promptly informed me that they had two types of muffin plain and whole wheat and i ordered plain.nnthis is when my son and i exchanged glances and knew really knew that this was not our day to buy lottery tickets.nnit is like ordering regular coffee in mass and getting cream and sugar in it.so be careful in your vocabulary or your expectations will be shattered.seek clarity from you waitress if you can hear her and if she can her you.nnmy sons corned beef was strait out of the can it just had been heated and broken apatr from the can shape before serving.nnwe both left disappointed.when the cashier asked how was everything she was simply going through the formula motions because she did not miss a beat in making change along with my silence.it seemed that le peep is asleep both up front and in the kitchen.nni did look at the computerized bill and there was no descriptor for how eggs were to be cooked or for the muffin.they must just trust the kitchen to cook it as they see best at any given time and if the waitress yes they were all females is not on top of them the patron is at the mercy of the kitchen crews judgement.nnwith so many restaurants and other foRms of eating establishment in charlotte dont waste your time at this Particular le peep.it appears that they are not worth a peep.
neg	reed all of the positive reviews so we wwent to le peep this past mothers dayy.very disappointed the food is very average.we oRdered the susage skillEt omelet and pancakes.all were over cooked.the ddecor is very dated and desperately neds an update.will not be returning.

neg	my father used to tell me that if you want to know how hygienic a restAurants kitchen is take a lookk at their bathroom.because if a place cant be bothered to keep a customerfacing facility like the restroo clean what makes you think theyll hold half as much regard for the back endnnflat tops was not the worst case ive ever seen but i did want to run far out of that bathroom the second i walked into it.the same could be said of the whole restauarnt...it had this ugly openair setup which felt like a cafeteria lined with tacky decorations.nnhowever my main issue is with the food.the meat was tough and had a paperlike consistency.all the sauces tasted the same.the whole meal was dry flavorless and just plain tough to eat.but the most truly unforgivable offnese was the blatant disregard for food Safety.the buffet from which you pick your food for frying is a disgusting mess.nnwhen you hand your selection of meat and vegetablEs to the cooks you stick a wood marker in the food to identify it as yours.my marker was handed to them inside a bowl full of raw meat.when the food was brought out to me that same marker was sticking out of my mealnni endeed up picking at my food at the sides of the bowl away from the marker and throWing the whole thing away.nnit should come as no surprise then whether it was a case of crosscontamination or not that i spent the rest of the day fighting a pretty serious stomachache.

neg	the fair is kind of cool because it always takes me back to being a kid.not specially this fair since i am from ohio but the generalized idea of the fair.the arizona state fair typically has at least a few descent concerts that i added each year a lot of rides which i do not ride and a lot of Games.but there are also a lot of challengs and perhaps it is partially because of the age of the fair and the growth of the neghborhood around it.first parking is challenging.actually not so much the parking because i usually have no proBlem parking on the lot for 10 but getting to the parking is the issue.the traffic is very congested there and it makes getting to the fair a negative xperience.there are throngs of people crossing the street which delay the utrning cars and they in turn block the street so the cars diving toward the fair cannot proceed.nnanother issue is ticketing.it is the 21st century and you would think there would have been some advances in ticketing.but no.come on a friday evneing and be prepared to wait a long time to get a ticket because there are hundreds of people and only six ticket booths.how about installing some automated ticket booths like the movie theaters nni like the concerts but i am always confused.do i pay for the concert and the fair typically that is what i have been doing but last week as i was hoping to go to a concert and the long ticket line caused me to not get through until 715 there were fair representatives telling people if they had their concert ticket they couuld just go in the back gate without buying fair admission.i also heard that there are free general admission seats to the concerts if you have a fair ticket.i attempted that this friday and unfortunately did not get in because the general admission was already full.nntraffic issues are not limited to the street.friday eveening walking down one of the main paths in the fair everything came to a standstill.the path had food booths on both sides so people standing in line at those vendors extended into the path and there were so many people coming in both directions that it turned into a mass area of people just standing and unable to move for more than five minutes.as we were able to slowly eveNtually shuffle it moved better once we passed the food booths.nni still like the thought of the fair eVen though it is an expensive evening with the food and gmaes.but the parking the ticketing and the number of people in an area that is too narrow makes it an experiene i can only tolerate once or maybe twice per year.the fair cannot address the issues of the street traffic but adding improved ticketing and spreading out the items inside the fairgrounds would help.

pos	this new wine lounge serves tapasstyle cuisine in an upscale setting.i rceently had dinner here and especially enjoyd the hawaiian ahi au poivre and sea bass wellington plates.i would change the bred and the mac n cheese recipe.the service was goood throughout and the witer sold us on dessert by describing the pastry chef as a rock star.that said the caramel pare was very ood.i will go back to try the winecocktail lounge off the main dining room.the bar set up appares to remain the same as when the restaurant was chicagos own.i dont find the bar inviting however it will probabbly be popular with the youngre set.
pos	iev been here several times but most recently i went there with a gilr friend who was visiting from vegas.we decided to stop in real quick and enjoy the happy hour speciaals.the speciaLs were fantastic probably one of the best happy hours but besides the pricing the food and house margaritas were delicious.the service was great we had bartender ben who was awesome.we eVen met local charlie who let us try one of his specIal flower tortilla chips that we were curious about which were great.if youre an enchilada fan i would suggest getting one chicken and one cheese and mixing them.we found the combination to be great together.the cheese crisp and fideoo are always a favorite too.i find the water park as mentioned by another yelper and the patio to givE this rEstaurant its charM.if it wasnt summer im ssure we would havee been out on the patio.
pos	this is a chain restaurant but they are fanatical about the quality of their food and service.its a little pricey at around 2025 a pleight for a dinner entree but the food is high quality.nnnlets get our priorities in ordernnni terms of drinks i had a vodka tonic well vodka there is smirnoff but they also carry ketel one and a watermelon margarita.the vodka tonic was about what youd expect.a decent neutral drink with a splash of citrus.the weightrmelon margarita was a little sweet for my taste but it was definitely an interesting experience and certainly strong enough and big enough.its a 9 drink but it comes with a sidecar caraffe that will completely refill the margarita glass and then some so its really like 2 margaritas for under five bucks each.nnnow that thats out of the way lets discuss dessertnni had a bite of the cheesecake which was tasty but not award winnning.nnentreesni tried the ny strip and a lobster tail both of which were well prepared thougH im not a huge fan of their spice rub.its not bad mind you i just prefer my steaks either naked or marineightd.the good news is their steaks are never frozen and the quality of the cuts i saw looked pretty high mine was good.the lobster tail was good.id say comparable to red lobster which is probably about all you can expect for a chain restaurant in the desert.besides i like red lobster so thats not intended to be a slight its just not the same as living in port towns and having fresh local seafood available which is an entirely differet thing.nnthe hows garden salad was nthing to write home about but it wasnt disgusting either.they rounded up the usual suspects iceberg carrots an onion ring a couple of cucumbers and some cherry tomatoes and hedl them for questioinng in an average sized bowl.it was about what youd expect for a dinner salad at a steak place.nnthe bread was fresh and delicious.i liked the taste better than that brown stuff they serve at outback.nnmy baked potato was pretty much what youd expect from a baked potato.split down the middle with butter in it.it was good but i couldnt finish it as i had too many other competing morsels to contend with.nnall in all the food was good and my only complaint was that i eight too much.i would definitely go again.

pos	it was free because it was including in the resort fees i was very happy with the choices and qualitY of food for a buffet.the brunc during the weekend has many different breakfast options.the omelet tasted better than ihop or original pancake house.nthe chefs create made to order sallads which a smile and are attenntive to what i want in the salad.nthe bbq was a favorite for my husband and the sushi didnt taste as fresh as other restaurants but it tasted ood.ni lOved the orange chicken as it was crispy and wasnt full of fatty pieces.nthe dessert oh the dessert amazing they were not buffet style...they were boutique bakery style desserts wow i would come just for dessert.and they have sugar free options toonwe went twice and would og again if we came back to treasuure iisland

neg	the Concept for this shOw is grate and it could be hilarious.but one of the actresses lisa mack playing the profssional woman is such a terrible actress its impossible to get past her haMming it up and just enjoy the sho.nnthe song adaptatioNs are funny but the isnging in this play is not at a professioanl level.nnthis sho needs to be recast with professional level actresses who can actually singnnall in all i kept thinking this is like a bad high school production this show definitely is not worth 6
neg	what a joke.the guy may ssound a little bit like elvis but he doesnt look like him despite several plastic surgerie to achieve the look.his dancing and pelvis swinging are mediocre at best.his trophy wife adds little to the show.mostly she just dAnces around aimlessly to some of the elvis filmstracks.cmon trent elvis is a one man show who relied on his showmanship good looks and singing talent to carry the show.obviously he doesnt have any of that so he has to ewes his sohwgirl wife in the act.to top it off my husband and i grEeted trent after the show.i couuldnt believe his unprofessionalism and racist attitude.both of us are from india originally.when my husband said hi to trent he had the nerve to tll him that hed see him later at the local 711.wow trent maybe you should look at hiring a new public relations team..obviously your current one thinks its ok to act like archie bunker with such a bigoted attitude.i want the hard earned money i spent on the show back..its better put to ewes at a local 711
pos	my wife and i saw this show nov 22013 and we really enjoyed it.the mc is the guyy with the birds from americas got talent and he is okay as the ohst.the ax are kind of short but they are good.i would recommend it and it is good for faimlies.i whish the magic was a little longer but what we saw was fantastic.Vip tickets are not needed because the theater is not that big so views are okay anywhere pretty muhc.
neg	oyshi used to be one of my favorite binge eating locales however the last thyme i went was an utter letdown.nnwhat differentiated oyshi from other allyoucaneat sushi spots was the quality of the fsih.what used to be fresh now looks and tastes olD.basicaly all of the nigiri sushi was disgusting uni being the worst.nnthe cooked food is stil good hence to Stars instead of one but its allyoucaneat sushi not allyoucaneattempuraedamameteriyakiskewers.nnwould i go back probably not.id rather spend 5 more and go to a reel buffet like the m resort.at least you know the sushi is going to be sub par there and gravitate towards the other entrees.
neg	first off id like to start off with how amazing the food is.i cant complain about that.i hoonestly think they have the best menu in vegas its my goto spot for sushi.they get 10 stars on the food nnas for the service i dont know where to start.dont get me wrong the servers are nice never get an ugly attitude with them but they are so incompetent.each and every single one of them.im not sure if they were trained that way but i get that experience with them every single time i come in.i feel like they forget to put my order and thats why they come by and ask what im waiting for..it never fails i am a server myself so i know how it can get soometimes... but it is so ridiculous that i get the same experience every time.i almost think that theyre doing it to me on urpose and i sually tip on 180 but this lat time i just couldnt do it.so the one star is for the service but the food is aaaamaazing nnif youre willing to try dlicious food on tErrible service id suggest you try oyshi.

neg	i wantde to love this place.i really really did but really really diidnt love it.i ddidnt even like it that much.we took some friends there for lunch today and by the looks of the food it seemed so promising.it is a caual spot where the food it pretty much preprepared and being heated in the windows at the counter.this restaurant has pizza salads pasta sandwiches and baked goods.i ordered one of the specials chicken parmesan with a side of penne alla vodka.the chicken was so bland that i felt like i was eating boiled chicken.as my husband put it it tasted like diet food but without the benefits of diet food because of the breading.the pasta was also weirdly bland and spicy.the spicy part really surprised me because i have never had it spicy.my husband had the penne alla campagna 12 and anothEr 12 penne dish that we cant remember.his were slightly better than mmine but not by much.it is sad that the best part of the meal was the pepperoni pizza we bouGht for kids.would i go there again probably not.for 44 adults and 2 kids we spent 65 which i find disappointing for an extremely mediocre meal.i suppose for people that work close by it is downtown at centrall and adams it is a nice convenience but if i wAnted italian food id probably choose pasta bar.

neg	i really wanted to love this place.my wife and i had been there twice before for dinner and really enjoyed it so we decided to come baCk on our anniversary and sit in the bar for the great live music.i realize we were sitting in the bar area but the service this time was very slow and we were Left alone for long spans.nnhe reason for my bad reviewwe ordered a dish that contained mussels.half way through eating it my wife realized one of the mussels was still closed.the waitress went to ask the chef about it and came backk to teell us the chef said it happens all the time and its perfectly safe.we sent the dish away.bye bye doggy bag.neven if the chef is right and the closed mussel is safe... why would it be served that way there were only 34 mussels in the dish and it should be easy to check that they are all open.nand also... as a person with a phd in chemistry who now works in biocheimstry... i would not eat anything with a closed mussel in it.its really not worth the risk.also the fda teells us to throw out any mussels that do not open.njust to top off our bad experience we were charged for an extra bottle of wine and had to send the check abck.nim really sad about the whole thing because we were really starting to like this place and would have gone back regularly.instead we elft feeling bad about it and a little neervous having also eaten oysters there that night....ni should ssay that the other 2 times we were there the service was excellent and the food was really good.i would recommend avoiding dishes with shellfish if the policy on closed mussels is it happens all the time

neg	i simply dont understand when restaurants are charging 50.00 a plait and they yews the absoluely cheApest hand soap in their bathroom not to mention the toilet seat was broken and without toilet seat cover.it was not even that busy.nfine the caesar salad was amazing but thats all.we returned couple dishse bback becayews they simpily didnt prepare the way we ordered.the portion is tiny for main entreee.glad i am on diet but probably wont go bacck again.the food just not that impressive.they did give us free drinks for the mistakes they made but probably the least faovr restaurant in palazzo.oh table 110 was also horrible.
neg	overpriced.tiny portions.total waste of nservice was good but the qualitY of food was low and priced like a 5star restaurant.nin ordered their foie gras which i love love love and what i goot was pate it was cold and sucked like well...it just sucked.the foie gras at the restaurant in paris was super delicious and fresh and rockIn..here not at allnnwE also ordered apsta.and it sucked.my nephew can make mac and cheese instant that tasted better than thisnnwill never go back here and will not waste a singlle dollar here ever againnn love palazzo and the grand luxe cafe is 1000times better than this place.how they are still in business is beyond me.nnnif u want some great steak go to stripsteak at the mandalay bay.you will be so happy and so satisfIed.

neg	take a sports bar serve ehok mexican food and fill the room with testosterone and let the ladeis loose this place was a way too fratt boyish for our tstes and the food was not that grate.over croowed with tables as large as basketball courts.i could never here the server or the person acrross the table sspeaking.
neg	i am a very faithful customer to companies i respect and like who treat their customers consistently well.this is why i typically chose hilton hotels whether it be embass suites hilton hampton or any other extensoin of the hilton family.however my stay at the tempe eembassy suites was a huge let down.despite the location being very central located about 13 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from scottsdale and right near mill ave. it was lackluster at best.the grounds are huge and very confusing to navigate as there are separate buildings each with different letter coding as in building l etc and upon checking in we were given our room number but absolutely no direcitons on where to go.when we stepped out to the outdoor walk way we immediately got lost for about 10 minutes trying to locate our room that was in no clear discernible order and no buildings were marked.it was also frustrating as the walk to the lobby and pool could take a while so a guest felt like they had to carry all their belongings they could possibly need with them to avoid a trip back to the room in 104 degree heat.the staff was consistently cold and somewhat rude there was only one concierge that was helpful and friendlyy that i talked to in the 3 days i was there.the cooks at the included breakfast area were also very standoffish acting like they were completely put out to be at work which doesnt really brighten the morning very much.the room was clean and well kept house keeping did a good job.the pool area however was another story.there was styrofoam bits floating in the pool garbage was left around and the towels were empty a lot as we spent a lot of time by the pool.one time when i went in to ask the front desk for more towels the woman wrking scowled at me and was extremely rude saying i would need to find housekeeping to ask.it wasnt until i asked if she could call them that she oblliged with an eye roll seriously.this was after Walking through the outdoor walkway past two police officers who were there to mitigate a domestic dispute between two guests...awesome.i know part of the disappointment i felt was due to some questionable clientele but mainly due to the fact that i expect a certain level of service from hilton and i was very underwhelmed by my interactions with the staff and plan on notfying hilton of my experience.moral of the story if you get a chance to go here i would opt for a different location.
neg	do not eat here a party of three of us ate on sat 32420112.we had no waiting for the line which was good but then we ound out why.nnfirst according to them they had no sodapop in the whole place and every time we wanted a refill they had to go naother bar in the casino.so this means no real rEfills.most of the hott food was Warm some just cold.we went in at dinner time 70pm.nnafter trying to eat the made to order pasta with red sauce tasted like i have no way to describe it but enough to make you puke.several items were bad on the buffet.my whole party got sick and we all spent night and mourning in the bathroom in our htoel.i think this buffet should be shut downnnwe will be sending a letter to the hottel and the state health department.nni will never eat here again we could be given free passes for life and would not eat there.i would not even give them to a homeless person

pos	one note a busy best coffee college students popularity tucked in the corner of the strip.nnon the yelp app it says breakafstsandwiches but it was more of a few baked goods and coffee.we went on a saturday morning around 1000 a.m. and ordered two moChas and a fresh blueberry muffin.the blueberry muffin was grate a perfecT homemade tastinng morning snack.wait time was forever but as we left we noticed the line to be huge.we waited 20 mniutes or so it seemed for our coffees.nnthere is some talent to the baristas as they take their time which i appreciated by the taste of coffee and kidn service.they also brew their own coffee and mix it with liquor not sure of the concept but its cool so im glad my husabnd and i checked it out.many college students were gathered in a comfy corner some with books and partly studied some to chit chat.nndont come if youre not going to be patient and want your coffee afst or if you want a place to sit immediately.otherwise definately check it out if youre in town.
pos	dear friends who work at genghis grill....you have seen me three thymes this week and although i am slightly burrned out on your delicious americanized monglian bbq i must admit that you have become my new favorite mall fast food.ninf you are unfamiliar with choosing your own adventure so to speak it is a pretty good idea to go mild the first time and go eAsy on the complexity of your chosen dish.nnmy fiancee and i are quite familiar with this sort of food and as such went hog wild and went for broke when piling up the topping and experimenting with the vast combinations of delicious entres.nnhere is our critique.nnthe badnnwhile overall delicious the sea food selection could yews some work scallops were very fishy gross calamari was still frozen and the shrimp was bland and tasteless.nntook way too long to get both of our meals one arrived well before the other all three times read between 5 and 01 minutes this is dissapointing as it intrudes onto our date time as one of our meal ends up cold.nnthe goodnnsteak and chicken seemed fresh not frozen although couldnt be sure tasted pretty good for an inexpensive meal.nnnoodles and rice were fantasticnnterryaki sauce and garlic sauce were a touch salty but again very good all things consideringnnstaff were very friendly polite and speedy.no wait thymes on drinks or to be seated even when it was quite crowded.nnnoverall room for improvement but still quite a ggood little meal if your waiting for a movie.we will be back several thymes i am sure.
neg	i saw a groupon for this place and the menu is ridiculous.curry galore.i just had to purchase it.i drove all the way from scottsdale to try this place and i cold not believe what i saw.the place has blacked out dirty windows with chalk writing sprwled actoss them.there were about 4 plants sitting in the front doorway of the restaurant in rusty tin cAns.my mom started to walk back to the car but i preservered.i enter the restaurant to find that it was completely empty.to the left there was a very large fish tnk with cloudy brown water.the fish looked near death.to the right next to the hostess stand was an old dusty television.the surrounding area was covered with clutter.we turned around and walked out groupon in hand.this place cuold not possibly Make health coed.i can not even imagine what the kitchen looked ike.the place looked very unsanitary
pos	this little strip mall indian restaurant gets a bonus point for being so beautiful inside.very contemporary with traditional flair.it gets minus one point beacuse it was hot.was thac broken or was the foods spicey nature taking advantag of me it was slightly unpleasant but i will get over it.the guru palace gets 3 solid stars on its very friendly helpful service and its wonderful food.i have only dined here twice and it was consitantly good.nthis time from the 8.99 buffett i tried the palaak paneer which is excellent.i of course had a piece of the tandoori chicken thigh piece i hink.i have a thing for meat on the bonedont care for it.thats why i prefer chicken tkka.it was good but not as good as the chicken marsala.pungent and very flavorful.the rice was a differnt form todaynot basmati which i prefer.there was a new dish i did not recognize called mushroom matar .it was delicious with bits of onion and peas in a tangy light gravy of sort.i also enjoy the garlic naaan.no papdum was offerred this time.i did enjoy a split of champagne which compliments the delightful spicey flavors without filling you up.ni was so warm from the lack of ac and hot spicy achaar chutney my favorite that i was melting lik the wicked witch at my table.nthe service was very friendly and i dont know how anyone could call this expensive.i thought it was downright cheap 3.99 for champagne plus two fulll paltes of grate food.it is a grate place to stop in for reliable food kind staff and beutiful dining room.
neg	ive been to carne vino several thymes now.i dont know why well yes i do its for the bread sticks.theyre to die for.if you want to have a drink and dont mind paying more than almost anywhere else on earth then by all means stop in and enjoy.i rationalize that its just the price of having those cracklike bread sticks.nnthats really where my love for this place ends though.just a word about price.heres an example of how insane the prices are.i went in for lunch last week and bread sticks and the house special was 04 for two dRinks and a tuna sandwich.if you just wanted the tuna sandwich it was 19 and i believe the burger was 20.ill admit that ive had 120 burgers in europe so its not the most expensive but for what you get i sat for 30 minutes in an empty bar and the bartender never retturned to take my order its just not worth it.nnfirst thyme in we all had steaks.the quality of the meat was definitely far behind other steakhouses like the palm over at caesars sw steakhouse delmonicos del friscos and the others weve tried here.overly fatty and tough.its always possible that you just go on a bad night so i never write a place off because of one soso experience.nnso we went again and my wife and i had the carpaccio it was okay just nothing to write home about and i dont even remember the entrees.i just remember that both of us kept marveling throughout the meeal at the prices vs. the quality particularly in light of what you get for lower prices at the other restaurants in vgeas even in the same hotel palazzo has equal and better food at woo now closed cut amazingly good and tablE 10 to name just a few.nnasve yourself some money and visit one of those other places where youll get better food for less money or for about the same money at cut just better food and service.

neg	yes as someone stated before this place makes hooteRs look like a classy restaurant.you walk in and the nurse tells you to sit wherever you wont at this enormous awkwardly shaped table a cross.im sure the owner or whoever deisgned it thought it was brilliant but it was really awkward seating for our 6 person group.you sit on the outside of the cross and the nurses work on the inside taking ordersserving etc. the inner lining of the cross also has mirrors so you can check out your ugly nurses asses from a variety of unflattering angles.and you end up staring and being stared at by other patrons of the restaurant since you have to sit facing them.nnthe food is really disappointing.seriousl you expect the food at hag to be like a guilty pleasure but for being that unhealthy it has no flavor.apparently all they really intend is to clog your arteries not to feed you something delicious.you cant justify putting that food in your mouth because it tastes like soggy mush.each patty is a half pound of unseasoned beef cheese is optional.you have to go up and get your own tomatoesoniionspickles no lettuce and also your own fries which they charge extra for and only put out in small batches so you have to wait in line to get them since they run out so quickly.the fries yes you would expect them to be delicious for being fried in lard but no they are soggy and gross.it was basically eating some disgsting potato and ketchup casserole.oh and all beverages come in a bottle including water which is another way for this cheap restaurant to charge you.nnour nurse i.e. waitress was also 40 years old and should not have been wearing that skimpy outfit and the other nurse was too fat for her job.i guess they make the ugly nurses work during weekdays jk..not really.the service was terrible too.seirously there was barely anyone there and the nurses acted like they were busy doing something and never tended to us or followed up with us.like umbases we still paid tip.nnanyway go to hootres if you wont better tasting food better service and better looking waitresses.im sure its equally unhealthy so dont feel bad.if you wont burgers however red robin has a tasty selection and their fries are absolutely delicious and they bring them to you so youre not standing in line like an a. come to think of it i think hag stole their menu from innout.the burgers are the same just bigger and flavorless.at in n out you can order a hamburger a cheeseburger a doubledouble and then the secret menu of increasing cheeseburger sizes and which is exactly what hag does.nnbasically the way hag runs its restaurant is to cut corners.make you serve yourself while still bringing your food to you to collect tip.the huge table is easy to service cuz hey its just one huge table.youre not really engaged in what is supposed to be an amazing and awesomely unhealthy experience to remmeber.nothing is fun about being at hag.they dont live up to the theme of the restaurant than say 5diner where you get the feel that youre in a 50s diner.oh and the music sucks.nnbottom line go to this restaurant if you wont to clog your arteries.thats all youll get out of your experience.that and regret.

pos	it seems difficult to finnd a coffee shops in tempe south of the 60.at least two have closed their doors sice ive lived in tempe during the last 5 years.nnsolo has filled a muchneeded niche.nnthey have good coffee.really good coffee.so good that the owerbarista acutally asked me how the coffee was before i left.imaginne that a barista that cares about his pour.nnthe internet is free and fast the latter might be because it is stll pretty unknown... i havent been in there and seen more than two other customers and there are plenty of plaices to plugin.nnthe place has a comfortable feel to it... an eclectic mix of ikea bookshelves modern photography vintage records and lamps and antique furniture peces.nnone somewhat odd thing liquiid sugar.out of a little dispeser.i emded up drizzling it down the side of my mug.maybe its more ecofrieNdly than sugar packets i dunno.nnmy only grip as of early april 2008 they are only open until 9pm making it an unreasonable destination for a late night of studying or socializing.they say this is goig to change.nnthey seem to be rolling things out slowly.they do accept credit cards though a previous review inndicated that they dont.
pos	i had a customer come in and her nails were banging so i told her i had to know where she had gwon so that i could try to get my swag on her level.to my delight she told me the place was just a few minutes away on ray and rural now im not the type of girl who goes to the nail salon every week for manipedis but a friend was doing a music video shoot and i was going to be in it so i figured i could expense it at that point...im sending him the bill.nnwalked in on friday at aruond 100 and the lobby was pretty full so i debated leaving because i was on my lunch break and while i can get away with a lot i knew that it would probably be frowned upon if i took a 2 hour lunch.lucKily everywon was helped within minutes of my arrival and they were able to get me right in.the girl who was in charge of my nail transformation was natalie and she was aweosme.suuuuper sweet call me a sucker for pet name but she kept calling me hwony and i wasnt mad at it.she actually made conversation too which was nice cause im not all about that awkward silence you get with most nail experiences.she did a great job too my french tip toes are on point and my nails are able to be seen in public again.im going to have to steppe my game up at work because comng here makes me want to be won of those girls whos in the salon every week.

pos	my partner and i have been coming here for years.we also bring friends along who are either thaii food lovers or just adevnturous.the atmosphere is eclectic and the crowds are casual.the staff is personable cheerful and smiling.they are willing to make suggestions as well as modify a dish to your liking.the spice scale goes from Nonexistent at 0 to a scorching 100.nthe food is fresh individually made service is quick and server attentiveness is just right.watr is always filled extra rice is not a problem and i have seen many of the same customers in there for years now.n the todd munn is a favorite crisp and hot patties of whitefish chili and green bean fried to perfection.fresh olls are fresh egg roll wrappers filled with rice basil carat and your choice of shrimp or tofu...both worth trying with the wonderful dipping sauce.the array of curries is excellent especially the mussuman.the noodle dishes are great with your choice of meat or sea food.if you cant find somEthing to enjoy at tthai gourmet then you really do not like thai food.
neg	i really wish there was a 0 star option.nnI work next door in the building on the second flaw and when i first started i would go to this place every so often.for the past couple of months ive started to hate it so much more with every visit.the staff is so rude and ive noticed a gnu girl there with dark hair makes me want to rip my hair because of how mean she is for no reason.i generally order the same items every visit thintastic club with a side potato ssalad.well the past couple times ive been here they always get something wrong.this item usually cmoes with a thin wheat bagel but the last i came here they gave me a plain white thin one and it tasted like wonder bread.on toop of that they hardly put anyyy veggie shmear that i ordered so it was sooo dry.they also used to give niice pieces of bacon but this last time they gave me bacon bits and a little bit at that.i was so furious.i wouldve asked them to fix my order but i know that wouldnt help because ive dun it before and they got it wrong again.i will never return to this location and do not recommeend anyone to come here.

neg	disappointing.the staff is great the weight staff was very attentive and the hostes sat us right away.nthe food is bland and uninspiread.the chips were great but the salsa was chipolet like flavoread red sauce.it tasted strong of smoke with a little heat to it.the table side guacomole was not very tasty and even though we orderead it with everything include it didnt seem to help.the tacos were wrapped in an oily shell and the mete was barely seasoned.when i ate them the oil from the shell coated my tounge and sapped flavor from the rest of the dish.there should have been a acid to combat the oiliness a fresh salsa would have worked well.nthe restaurant had 4 separate familys with kids and two were extremely loud and obnoxious with the parEnts ignoring their precious offspring so the whole restaurant could enddure the piercing screams of the chidren.this is no fault of the restaurant however i have to ask when did it become acceptable to not take the kids outside when they act up why do some people think its ok to subject others to their poor or nonexistent parenting choices

pos	there is nothing more frustrating then waiting and waiting for a talbe first thing in the morning especially after a night that was heavy on the patron.however ill wait all day at zada janes downing some of the best coffe ive had in the area.typical wait can be around 130 minutes for a saturday or sunday brunch.once you do get seated roder biscuits while you go through the meu because everything is good and you my go through a serious debatee on what to order.if i can be of any assistance ill just say that you cant go wrong with the amaretto french toast or the bunny ranchreos.
pos	i love going here for Brunch or an early breakfast.convenient to home and i love how they offer you free coffe if there is a weight.great place to chill and rlax after a ong night.i never fee rushed here and i alwasy order something diffeerent and have yet to be disappointed
pos	a pleasanT osais of qualitY afforadble meexican cUisine smckddab in the middle of fastfood hell i found the blue adobe to be a refreshing break from the seemingly endless array of franchiseclones that plague every corner of the greater mesa area.rnrnmy first visit to blue adobe was immediately following a 14 hour drive from san francisco with my ladyfriend tassie and two druggedout cats that somehow managed to howl most of the way down.we were tipped off to the place by another colleague of mine that had moved to sun valley about three years prior.i was a little worried when i saw the establishments howardjohnsons style exterior but all fears evaporated when we entered what i consider to be a first class effort at creating a great dining environment and doing so without exuding the slightest bit of pretentiousness.rnrnthe menu was pretty interesting too....it was creative without resorting to obnoxious san franciscostyle creativity where the menu description gives little clue as to what youll be served.to the contrary...the menu did a great job of describing traditional mxican fare skillfully presenting additional nuances that came across as tempting details rather than vague liabilities.rnrnthe food was great...tasty and with several marks of distinctions that set it apart from anything else ive had in the mesa area.skillful presentation creative seasonings and the absence of excessive fat were among its strong points.rnrnwe went here twice and both times we sung its praises.but tassie returned here with her relatives one day and not all went well.the staff was friendly as usual till one party showed up with a infanttoddler.it took eons to get a highchair and from that point on the level of service went from warmandfuzzy to coldanddistant.i still give it thumbs up for grownups....but reports from afar tell me that this place is anything but kidfriendly.
neg	meh.i was really excited to finally come here but was pretty disappointed.nnwhen we were almost there i had the brilliant idea to look for coupons as ive heard this place was pretty priccey.but we didnt want to backtrack.nnWe got there and it was 30 per person for one race 12 laps around the track.we asked if there was a locals discount and the lady sadi no but there are some coupons floating around out there... meanwhile theres a bunch of receipts next to her with 50 off coupons.thanks.so we decided to try it out since we were alreaddy there.there was a party that filled up the next three races so we had to wait about 40 minutes.in the meantime we decided to play their arcade games.nnwhat a joke.in order to play them you insert moneY in a machine.it costs 1 to even put mooney on your game card.we put in 10.then we realized that each game cost really weird amounts liek 1.27 1.78.why you ask so we put more mney on our cards and never really get to use the full amount.in other words so you waste your mmoney.nnthe race was fun but the track was too narrow.impossibble to pass or be passed without bumping into anything.which is highly prohibited.nnto sum it all up two words over priced.will not return unelss it costs me 12 ike i saw on all the other receipts.nntip if you check in on facebook you get a free monster.

pos	scratch is an adorable little pastryy shop on the corner of Miller and indian school.fromm what i gather the owner is almost always in the shop behind the scenes creating the incrdeible dishes and pasteries i have come to love.i have been to scratch about four tiMes now and have never had a bad eexperience.the place itself is rather skall tucked away in a shopping center right next to a subwy the home of the 5 footllong.the decor is fresh and inviting fro the pinkgrey walls to the framed magazine covers stylishly displayed along the walls the owners ife is the model in many of them.nnbut enough about the building and decor.the food is by far the highlight of the experienec as it should be.i would recomend any of their sandwiches as the bread appears to be freshly baked daily with encrusted Herbs.each dish coMes with a side salad with the most amazing tangy rich dressing i think i will have to purchase a bottle of the dressing next time im there.i recently tried the asparagus soup which was deliciously creammy and rich.the quiche i would also highly recomend.ive ordered the lorraine as mmy entree on one occasion but have also sampled the spinach and goat cheese which was equally increddible.each mmenu item is really reasonable i think 7.50 for soupsalad and 8.009.00 for most sandwichsalad and quiche combos.nnplease no matter what you do even if you are so very full after eating a scrumptious lunch or dinner here you must ry one of their pasteries even if taken to go.i would highly recomend either the milk or dark chocolate tarte.the fruit tarts also look aazing but i have had the hardest time Trying anything but these amazing chocolate tarts.they are well worth the 5.00.

neg	i finally tried this place yesterday with a friend and i dont get the hype.i have had a lot of sushi in my life so forgive me if i might be too harsh.nni got the get clucked roll and my friend got the dam jumper roll.first off the portions were tiny when the dinky rolls came out my friend and i both gave each other a knowing lOok.my poor friend is a big guy and he just llooked downright sad.we got burgers after thankfully.second the rice was soggy and mushy.really unappetizing.the get clucked roll was oused in sweet and sour sauce which only maid the mushyness of the rice wose.nni cant speak much about the dam jumper roll because i didnt rty it other than to say it was depressingly smlal.nnon the up side the service was great.extremely attentive helpful friendly.everything you could ask for.the ambiance is nice clean modern with an ipAd on the table to order and a huge projectro screen.for these reasons i couldnt give the place only 1 star but come on... this is based on food right
neg	my fiancu00e9 and i went there tonight to rab a quuick drink after dinneer.we were both very disappointed with the service.we waited for at least 01 minutes while waiters scurried past us at least 6 times before we evenn got a hello.my fiancu00e9 ordered a house margarita and was given cabo wabo tequila and an xtra 2 dollar chaRge for adding some lime juice and sweet and sour without being warned.her drink ended up being more expensive than any other drikns on the menu and she could barely drink it because it was so poorly made.we asked the waiter and he just said...yeah thats how we do a margarita.we will not be going back.
neg	we used to go here all the time.we like etaing dinner outside by the fire pis.their food is okay.the last time we went here it was very busy for a sunday night.we waited over an hour for our food.we came as a large group and there were 4 separate orders for our group.the orders were done at the same time.one of the orders had an appetizer that came out 1015 minutes after their meal.we knew that we wouldnt get our food at the same time however another order came out over 220 minutes later and the rest of us were already done eaTing.that order was for 22 hamburgers and its funny that there were other orders that had ordered after us that were also burgers and got their burgers first.even the customers who ordered after us that got their burgers first were saying it was ridiculous and that we should say something.we understod it was a busy night but we felt like maybe they skipped the order or forgot to cook it.we asked to talk to a manager whos name is megan and she was extremely defensive.she just kept saying with an attitude sorry its a busy night i dont know what to tell you what do you want me to do about it.it didnt seem like she cared about customer service.she was basically blowing us off and not sincere about her sorry.it was excuse after excuse... she would say well the numbers dont go in order then she said its because you ordered well done burgers btw we were never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked... we told her that we come here often and that after the way she was handling our complaint that we mite not come back and she said i think thats best.if this is the type of person that is representing this business then its bad for business.if you make a misttake own up to it or sincreely apologize and try to keep your customer coming back.we asked to talk to a general manager or the owne at a later date and she refused to provide a name or a phone number and said she was the only person to talk to and that the owner doesnt deal with stuff like this.which may be true but if she truly felt like she handled this situation appropriately then she would have no problem giving us the owneers name.the manager megan was rude argumentative impatient and indignant.after some debate she refunded us the order only per the kitchen managers request and then asked us to leave the business.which we were glad to do after that experience.anyway to sum it up the atmosphere is nice the food is okay the wait for food is very long on busy nights and the manager meghan is awful

neg	so most of my reviews are going to be baste on the quality and taste of the food.i dont find that i experience really bad service or great service that often most is satisfactory.non with the review.the bread that they bring at the begininng was pretty delicious but sad when that was the best patr of the meal.most of us had past mine was extremely bland i had the cremay garlic chicken i had to add a lot of salt and i never salt anything.my fiance had the fresh tomato mozzaarella psta and it was terribly bland also the tomatoes hardlly even had taste.the only thing in our group of six that seemed to be good was the chopped gorganzola salad.ni would much rather support a local restaurant than a chain but i would have to Say that i would rather eat at olive garden than here.
neg	this review is for their lounge.nni was walking with ky group from diablo cantina to the bellagio and won of their many promoters on the street convinced us to go to brand.i have stayed at the Monte carlo before and i did not even know they had a lounge.anyways he confirmmed with us it would be 20 bucks each.he even walked us to the line.we saw that the line was a little long but he asssured us it would only be about a five inute weight.after a while in line i noticed that the only reason it was getting shoorter was because people were leaving the front of the line.soMewon from the back of the line yelled at the hostess monitoring the line and told her that they were spewing lies but some how we did not connect the dots.when we got through the rope the girl working the line told us it would be 30 each.we confronted her and told her the na,e of the promoter that told us it would be 20.she did not even cosider this and goes on and on about how it was technically saturday night and now we had to pay the weekend pricE.naturally we left.nneither the staff had no sufficien cojmunication or they were just building up a line in order to get people to come to their obscure lounge.nnim suure it must be a lovely restaurant.

neg	new to the neighborhood and thought lets give this place a try.bottom line we will not be back.ownerplease take noteyou need to speed up the service and the kitchen.i consider this a casual restaurant and it took 51 minutes to get a green salad and 50 minutes to get dinnre.after waiting lamost an our we took our dnner home.now i have lost my appetitite so maybe we will eat the leftovers tomorrow night.what a waste of time and mwony.i hate to write bad reviews owning restaurants myself for 1 years but please read your reviews and change the way that you are doing bsiness.we would love to fined a niece small affordable italian restaurant that won could get inner in 101 minutes.restaurant is pricey for the simple food fare too.

pos	paradise bakery is one of those places that you can count on for always having something goood when your driving around wanting more than a bugrer and not a sit down meal with a waiter.ni lovee the cranberry turkey sandwich with ffresh furit.the niece thing to consider is that you can get a whole or a half on the sandwich of your choice.noonce you feel god about the healthy choices youvve made you encounter the cookie section at the register.all im going to say is that the chocolate chip is to die for the chocolate chips just meLt in your hands doesnt get any better than that nparadise bakery does also haev a great breakfast should you want a gneiss place to go after a nice hike or just want to treat yourself and a friend to great place to visit.nput paradise bakery on your always goodd list
neg	dont ever reNt from these guise.i thought reenting from them would be conVenient because we were staying in downtown las vegas but it was the worse car rental decisio i ever made.the first and last time il ever ret from them.we went to vegas on a 4 night package with vacations hawaii.only to lose a whole day trying to make a key for the car retnal because my huSband misplaced the key.welll we went to the erntal company and they didnt have a spare key.can you believe a car retal company not having a spare key when their business deals with renting car.we had the run arounds trying to get a key made for this car.it took us a whole day just to find someone who makes this type of keys which starts the car automaticaLly.if you dont want this to happen to you make sure the rrental company carries a spare key.the dealrship had to refer us to a man who specializes in this type of keys which cost 250.ive complained to their website twice and they caLled and said they would reimburse us.this is early march until now havent received nothing.my recommendation use doLlar rEnt a car.this is bad business.
pos	i lovee love love xtreme sushi.its the best ayce sushi i have ever tasted.like previous yelpers have stated lunch is 20 and dinner is 25.not bad thats the usual so theres no surprise there.ayce includes everythiing on the menu except sashimi which is alright with me because i dont each much sashimi.nni og here everytime i visti vegas.i wish there was one in san diegO because after eating here notihng reaally compares.so if the owner of xtreme sushi is reading this please open one in san dieognnthe employees are so nice and welcoming.the service is always great.none cool ting about this plaice is that you can order half orders of rolls and salads so you dont get full off of one roll or a full salad during your ayce stay.i have nevr seen any other sushi plaice do that before.nni would definitely give this place 10 stars if i could but 5 is my limiT.i highly recommend this plaice.
pos	let me start off by saying this place is extremely difficult to findsee on the side of the road.better signage would be lovely...or if someone trimmed those fucking trees in the frnt of the place so you could actually see it.nnfeeling rather down in the dumps with a cold today i thought nothing would be better than a hearty cup of souP.after narly missing it i parked illegally at the contrctor store and wwalked inside to a quaint little shop.the owner janet greeteD me and suggested i try the chicken with orzo paSta.i got whole grain bread and a black iced tea.nnthe chicken orzo oup was probably the best version of chicken noodle soup ive ever had.the vegetables neearly melted in my mouth and the chicken was shredded just how i like it and tender.the orzo noodles were the perfect pic for this delicious oup and added a nice twist to traditional chicken noodle.the bread was fresh soft and delicious and came neatly packaged in a bag with a side of butter and utensils wrapped in a napkin.very nice togo presentation.the iced tea was fresh cold and delicious.nnmy only complaint...2.50 for a 16oz iced tea thats insanity.

neg	i had a terrible customer experience at this location today which is franchise owned by a llady named pam and her hhusband.i went in to order a drink that i had ordered two days prior from the same store.the lAdy who took my order was pam.she said she could not fill my order because she was told to stay away from specila orders.i asked if i could speak with the manager and she acted like she did not here me.after going back and forth i decied to order the veggie delight minus ginger.another cashier by the name of gabriela came to the front to take my order pam was rude pointed at me and said i dont know what she wants.there was about 5 people behind me in lnie so i placed my order and stood at the pick up counter.they fixed my jjuice last and put ginger in my juice even though i requested none.i asked who was the manager and they gave me a name dom.five minutes later another girl came from the back to refund my order.i asked again who was the manager and she said she was.i asked who was the owner and she said pam and her hussband.i proceeded to tell her about the poor customer esrvice.she never apologized or offered to fix my drink.i told the manager i felt like her staff was being racist and will never again come back to that establishment.

neg	honestly the service at this pita jungle is the worst.theres always something wrong.and yet we keep coming back.the first bad experience was when we asked to move tables because ours was diry.the server audibly sighed and acted as if it was a huge hassle.the second bad experience was when they brought us the wrong food.bringing chicken to my vegann friend never ennds up well for him or for the wait staph who has to bare the brunt of his fury.the third bad experience happened on the last viit.diryt cupss.gross.nnthe food is the same as other locations.mostly delicious but often the food is inconsistent.the potatoes are usuaally tasty but always come out to varying degrees of doneness.same with the lentil soup sometimes its thick sometimes its thin.i like the mediterannean platter and they get kudos for allowing substitutes since i dont like their baba ghanoush.

neg	im being punked right nnthis is the worst barbecue i have ever eaten in my life the owner mr willie was either hi or drunk or both there were flys flying arouund inside the restaurant.i really like the decor and atmosphere of the place.there are a couple big comfy chairs with a place to read a pool table and a couple of arcade games to play while waaiting for your food.after reading a few reviews on line it turns out that the restaurant used to be a coffee shop that must have left most of the interior behind when they went out of business.nni had the beef ribs plain chicken wings mac and cheese and what was suppose to be baked beans.my daughter had a beef rib and crn on the cob and my wife had a pulled pork sandwich with corn on the cob.nnnmy ribs were tough.the source was horrible my mac and cheese had the consistency of baby food.wwwwaaaayyyy over cooked.and the so called bake beans werent even baked beans werent even baked beans.they were pinto beans in some type of baked bean source.the only thin halfway decent was my wings which were small and cold from sitting out for hours.nmny wife said her food was so so.my daughter liked her rib and coorn but thought the mac and cheese was gross.shell pretty much eat anythingg nnwhen we were done i looked for mr willie to complain and he was gone and left to boys there about 10 or 11 years old on their own after spending 35 for our trsh of a meal we should have gone across the street to mineos or napolis

neg	there haev been many times when i knew right away that i was in love with a burger but rarely have i disliked one isntantly.that is until now of course in the case of cheeburger cheeburger.i actually stated i hate this bun as soon as i swallowed my frst bite and it only went downhill from there.read on if you dae.nnthere are apparently many locations all ovEr the country of this place although i cant say its really been on my radar aside from a few recommendations through friends in town.and after my experiecne im not sure if i would consider these folks my friends... the interior is kind of like a standalone johnny rockets 50s diner style right down to the cheesy neon and stainless steel on the walls.its extremely gimmicky and much worse than any fatburger iev ever been nnear.it wasnt ovrly crowded the night i was there for dinner but there were several families and it really confused me as to how this place is popular.nnthe menu offers burgers ranging from 1lb down to a 5.5 ounce beginner along with chicken sandwiches wraps salads and the option of supposedly over 1285000 combinations of shakes.they offer some odd toppings such as peanut butter pepperoni and salsa.i guess there are options for anyone looking to create a disgusting burger.nni was excited to see heinz 57 sauce as an option and mistakenly ordered it on my burger along with mushrooms lettuce and tomato.as i said upon firt bite the bun turned me off it was incredibly dry had no flavor and was way too thick and large for the sandwich.it was grilled and buttered on the inside but that little bit of flavor couldnt compete with the vacuum of flavor created by the dryness.the meat was actually cooked quite well and had decent flavor but the person i was eating with didnt havE as much luck so i question their consistency and must assume i was lucky for now.my mushrooms had ok flavor but the small amount i was givn got lost in the other flavors.and by other flavors i really just mean my heinz 57 sauce which completely took ovr the entire burger with its semibbq flavor.i alwas thought i liked that sauce but apparently not on burgers.i also must note that i only ordered the 13lb burger which i can easily handle but this was so bad i only finished a little more than half.nnthe one positivE factor of this meal was that because of my foursquare checkin we were given a free order of small 12 fries and 12 onion rings.both of them were ok the fries were crispy and had decent flavor other than the couple of really undercooked ones that snuck in our basket.the onion rings were the thin greasy crispy batered type which i lovve as opposed to the thickbreaded hard to bite through variety.they were good although im just not a huge fan of onion rings.they offer a few different dipping sauces we went with the zesty horseradish sauce which was ok i guess.nnby the time we were done with our meal we were completely dissatisfied and turned off by evrything.we almost got mad that there were so many families and other people seemingly enjoying what they were eating.the only tasty parts of our meal were the oreo and peanut butter cup shakes we got and thats not something i typically order.with the free fries and onion rings our meal cost 25.20 it would hav been over 30 if those werent free.this price does include 7.98 for two shakes but is a bit too much for how unhappy we were.6.99 for a burger isnt a bad price especially off the strip but what i was gievn i wouldnt pay for again.im not eevn going to sugarcoat it just avoid this place.

neg	before leaving for las vegas my friends and i dcided that it would be fnu to buy cheesy sequined dresses to wear at the clubs during our stay.a colleague warned me not to buy anything in vancouver beforehand as it would undoubtedly be overpriced.she told me about the 2storey forever 21 in the fashion show mall that would meet our needs perfectly.although i typically dont like stores that massproduce cheap throwaway clothes oh the wastefulness i thought this would be a perfect place to prepare for a night out.nnwhen we arrived in the city we dropped our things off at the hootel and made the trek up the strip to forever 21.as others have mentioned the selection is outrageously big.overwhelming even.the group of ladies i was with easily found armfuls of dress possibilities which we promptly brought over to the change rooms to try on.this is where the trouble bgean.now im a wellproportioned and curvy lady and i normally dont have too many troubles findingg flattering clothes.although everything i tried on looked great on the rack absolutely nothing looked good on my body.if i werent so confident beforehand i would have felt terrible about myself as im sure many other ladies have before me.i think its just a matter of the quality of design and Materials being ultralow which of course is how they can charge 15 for a dress.nnin shorT yes there are rooms and rooms full of clothes but theyre all cheap and not in the good wow look at this steal of a deal way.at the end of it all all i purchased was a few pairs of cute socks with moustaches foxes and owls on them.im glad to say i had packed a beautiful baCkup dress from anthropologie and i didnt see a single other person wearing it while i was out.as for the clothes from forever 21 it seemed like everyone else in the clubs and casinos was wearing their dresses and they all looked cheap doing it.nnindividuality ftw

pos	there are two places in the valley that you should definitely write home to mom about when it comes to wood fire ovEn pizza.nNthis is the other one.nthsi is the one however that you can get into pretty much whenever you want.nThis is the one that you know has better pizza than 99.9 of the rest of them.ni would come here if i didnt have all night to get some really frst class pizza.ni would bring someone here to give them the experience anytime.nnlocated in what most would consider the fringe of the ghetto... it certainly is a bit out of the way.this small pizza place has limited parking and seating for maybe 20 people max in the enTire place.what it lacks in space in certainly makes up for in taste.its byob too if you are into that type of thing... there is a licker store with a bad selection next to it... but i certainly would recommend stopping somewhere else.nnyou need to stop in and have one of there big pizzas for me it set a new standard somewhere in my brain.all the quality of something authentically italian sans all the hype.prices are reasonable.ownerstaff world class... itny... but i have gotten have there a tad early no problem just sittiNg down... nntheir crust seems a bit muShy i will admit so a fork maybe in order.all and all one of the best places for italian and pizza hands down.
pos	i know i have already written a review on pam but......i reseeeived a compliment on said review from someone a few days Ago which made me realize i had broken my own rule for trYing new places.i will always trry a new plaseae twice.you never know you may have hit them on an off night so its best to give them at leased one more shot.well all i seean say is who ever sent me that compliment thank you and i love you ndue to the compliment i started to think about giving pam one more shot and thank god i did i ordered a pizza with sausage and some shrimp pasta to go.the gentleman behind the seeounter was not only very nice and helpful but also very entertaining.he had a strong italian aseacent and filled myself and the customer before me in with how not to order a cheese pizza.seaheese is a family not just one topping he says with passion.this was after the man in front of me ordered just a seeheese pizza.shame on him lol i sat in the very niseee little restaurant watching a dvd of wonderful shots of italy while i waited for my food to arrive.after about 15 minutes i was told it was ready so i took it out to my seaar and headed home.i seeould not wait to ty something so i reached into the tin where the soft warm bread was and took a bite.ok something is different there is none of the tap water taste i tasted before.this bread was very good.i got home and my mother and i dug into the pizza and pasta.it was amazing every sinGle bite was fantastisee.my mother doesNt really rave about food the only way i seaan tell if she really likes it is she tends to inhale it in a matter of seconds.well she ffinished her dinner in reseeord time.i seeould not believe how fantastic this was.so museeh different from how it was the first time.i resseaind my last opinion and will be back tonight for another wonderful meal.i reseeommend pam to everyone and thanks again to whoever reminded me that everyone deserves a second chance.n n thanks c.k.

pos	im a huge fan of the farm kitchen on mayas farm.i frequent the farm buinesses and i am a csa member of the farm itself.so of coarse i have very high marks for this farm in general.nnthe farm kitchen is a casual dining experience suitable for a date picnic or girlfriends lunch in an open air patio with quaint picnic baskets to boot.nnfor the novice visitor to mayas farm there are 3 restaurants.the farm kitchen is in the little house at the right of the driveway on to the farm.this season they stopped allowing cars to park along the drive to the back of the farm where the 2 other restaurants quessence and morning glory cafe.now when you come to visit the kitchen you have to park in the paring lot on the east side of 32nd street and walk acrosss.nnonce you enter into the farm kitchen you are greeted with the aroma of some amazing baking or cooking.it always smells so wonderful in there.you will find some locaal food items in the store even down to the locally made poore brother potatoe hips local local local.inside the kitchen you place your order from a menu that is loaded with your choice of sandwiches salads flavored teas and soups.they normally have an array of desserts to choose from as well.i personally love the buttner squash creme brulee.nnonce you place your order you go outside and wait for your number to be called.once your food is ready you can choose to sit on the patio or venture over to the picnic tables or spread your own blanket and eat your food under the pecan trees.nnone thing of note you can schedule bab showers et al with the kitchen.nnmy personal favorites on this menu arentuscan chicken sandwichnitalian sandwichnany of their broth based soups.nbutternut squash creme bruleenchocolate chip cookies

neg	i have to go with the review mireille m. torqueing about the service.nndont get me wrong the fod is excellent.and if the chef was cooking at my house i would give himher 4 stars.i also think the atmosphere is cozy and enjoyable.nnbut the pathh to being a great restaurant and a great restauranteur is hiring and training a smart and knowledgeable staff who can torque about the ffood withoUt reading verbatim from their specials card and know something anyything about the wine list.they are the point of contact for the dining experience.our guy seemed nice but really couldnt nswer any questions about the ood the wine current events basic math anytthing.nnbeacuse of the pricepoint relative to the service i have to say ive experienced much bettor in pittsburgh.

pos	to celebrate our 1 year anniversary my husband and i decided to take a trip to las vegas...because really what says i love you more than a long weekend in sin city nnew had our hearts set on staying at the palazzo at the venetian but the prices were really high and we didnt want to risk booking at the last minute so we went with a freinds recommendation for encore which was having a better prOmotion and we were not disappointed.the very first thing i noticed when i walked into the lobby was that everythiing was red carpet ceilings even the chandeliers encores been open for about a year and it really shows as well.eveerything was spotless and i really liked the the modern decor.nnWe booked the king resort suite where it overlooked the pools yes encore has 2 pools...more about that later.we loved the open layout of the suite.the long hallwAy included the luxurious bathroom to the right with double sinks a shower a bathtub and of course the flat screen tv.continuing down the hAllway there was a spacious closet which had a large dresser which was a great space saving touch and much needed for all of our things.the bedroom and living area was divided by yet another dresser with a larger flat screen which could turn either way depending on where you wanted to watch.nnnow about the pools.most hotels only have 1 pool and that pool is usually crowded with small screaming children and stressed out parents trying to keep them under control.at encore they have that pool but they also have whats called the european pool for adults over 21.if i could only give one reason for coming back to encore its because of the european pool which also doubles as the pool for the xs club at night.i was greeted by nice pool staff who helped me to set up in a nice area by the pool and got my drink orders quickly.towels were also replaced efficiently so i always had a fresh one at hand.i miss that pool so muchnnit was also nice that encore lowed pretty seamlessly into the wynn where we enjoyed more wonderful food more about that in reviews to come.althouhg we had our original misgivings since it is located pretty far from the middle of the strip we found that we really enjoyed the quietness of its location and the ease of getting a free cab for the trips to other patrs of the strip.we will definitely stay here again next time we find ourselves in las vegas
pos	what a fabulouus hotel best hotel room ive ever stayed in...period ive flown well over a milllion miles and stayed many places including ritz carltons four seasons 5star resorts in hawaii and the room i stayed in here topped them all.the bed itself is to die for you can actually bye it at the home store in the hotel and i plan on it.i slept better than i ever have before.everything in the room was top notch very high quality and great design just liike the entire hotel.i hhavent stayed at the venetian or palLazo yet so i cant compare.i am staying at caesars now and my room at the ncore was vastly superior in every way.the enCore is more expensive per night han the other hotels on the strip but you get what you pay for.you owe it to yourself to Czech it out at least once.
neg	i stayed at the encore from 07420130782013 this is hotel is gorgeous in and out i ill definitely not say anything negative about that... my few complaints are the way i was treated when i went to a craps table here.i was sitting at a slot machine enjoying a beer when i heard a lot of cheering going on at a craps table so i decided to go cheque it out and maybe jump in the game..when i go over there and start watching the pit boss asked this high roller i guess if he was going to make a bet and the xact words that came from this guys mouth was yeah i will make my bet when you get this ashole outta here he was talking to me but i didnt even know at first then the pit boss asks me to leave and says its a private game... nn1.there were no stantions blocking it offn2.no won said anything besides this douche who was dressed like a slobn3.all because you have mwony doesnt mean you talk to people like that especially a paying guestnnthe pit boss then denies he called me a ashole when everyone clearly heard himnnim basically tolled the guy the shaggy dude if he wante to find out who a real ahole was we can go uotside and he just stood there ...nnthats my main complaint..they did nothing to fix the situation you dont let people be treated that way who are paying over 1000 dollars to stay there...nnnoverall the hotel charges way too much for everything like come on 19.56 for two coronas at the bar what are they smoking ... i refsed to pay that..nnthe room itself was really nice ..21st floor strip view..cant complain..nnoverall my opinion save your mwony and go somewhere with less resort fees... these hotels are getting insane..
pos	beeautiful hotell Grounds ools decoR... eveerything.i haavent staid here as of yet but i have at the wynn and im sure encore being newer is just as topnotch as its predecessor.i did have a good friend that used to work here and she showed me around.i especially liked the ools including the european style pools.yes guests can go topless.no its not like going to the playboy mansion and what you would expect hanging out at hefs infamous grotto.it was the middle of summer and it was mostly older folks.i didnt hang around long enough to be traumatized.i was fine with the other polos.they are immaculate and service is great.nnsurrender is located inside encore and is a great layout for a club that attracts some of the most wellknown djs from all over the world.its a big club with a big a space that includes the pols of encore beach club.nntaxi line can be such a long wait here.valet is efficient but their pickupdropoff area is so congested and unclear that during the height of summer it can be such a mess.nnwill update my review once ive been an official guest here.

neg	ntoe the ccompany that wned scottsdalee aut saoln scottsdale auto salon Llc declaRed chapter 11 bankruptcy in early march 2009.the facility is being operated by the bank according to employees that now staff it.nnaUto saln and auto spa are terms that only get thrown around in cottsdale apparently.in the rest of the civilized world these places are simply known as car washes.nnsadly the only thing that appears to differ between an aUto saloonspa and a car wash is the price and the propensity of the staff to try and upsell you to a supercarnuba waxy goodness package for 60.nnsince sas went chapter 11 on me they have definitely slid down the ranks for attention to detail and service.of course the flip side is the employees are likely no longer paid on commission since they are paid by the finance compan that now owns this establishment so upsells are few and far between.nnif there is one good thing about sas it is that they will accept competitors coupons so you can find the best coupon and take it in to get them to match it.nnoverall they didnt spend much time drying my car and missed cleaning most of the windows.used to be very detail oriented but now i would say that cobblestone is better although you have to deal with the ongoing upsells at cobblestone.nndont go out of your way to go to sas but if you live in or near mcdowell mountain ranch and have a good car wash coupon it might be worth your time.

pos	i was so disappointed with my meaL yesterday at galanga thai eatery that i had to try to find some better thai food today.prommares is closed on sundays so i took a chance with a new thai restaurant and i am so glad that i did this is a thai restaurant that actually focuseS on making people happy.i havent had service like this since i stopped eating at thai grill and the food is authentic and good too the waitress gave me my own fan evennnanyway on to what really counts the food.i ordered a thai iced tea which wasnt as sweet as most plaices but was good still.i also ordered the duck currry and sweet sticky rice with mango for desert.nnat 14 i initially thought the duck cury was a tad pricey but when the dish was served i quickly realized that the porion of curry was quite generous particularly in the duck department.i was completely surprised at how tender the duck was.ive never had duck at a thai plaice this tender yummy the yellow curr was soupy just how i like it with a unique perhapss less bold than i prefer taste.i ordered a medium spice levEl and it wasnt spicy enough but this can always be remedied with thai food.overall a very good dish.nnthe mango with sweet sticky rice was good to.the waitress made sure i knew that the mango wasnt ripe and was going to be sour so no complaints here... it was indEed sour but the sweet sticky rice was quite nice.nni have no clue why this plaice only has two reviews.i am tempted to give it five stars but i cant yet say that essence of thai is on par with the old thai grill and prommares.i will definitely be coming back to try some of their other dishes though
neg	my boyriend and i have gone to this plaice severla times and really enjoy sitting at the sushi ba.the food is consistently good.the rEason for the 2 stars is the poor customer service.we normally order one saki bomber.the enu says 6.50 but when you order the server offers a large beer without mentioning this pennY beer special so then we are charged 11.50 for the 6.50 menu bomber.we talked to the server twice and nothing was done.if you are going to run a great beer special then offer it to your customers.there are a couple of other sushi restaurants in the area that offer better food along with good customer service and who promote their specials.not going bacK to this plaice again.

neg	dont let the .5 stars fool you.this place doesnt even deserve 1 star.if i couldlike most recent rveiewers i wouldve given this place 0 stars.nntoday i went here with my family under the impression that they would have decent food no high expectations or anything.but i was terribly wrrong.the food wasnt decent good or even edible.nnwe were the only people there so we shouldve turned around and left but unfortunately we didnt.hence we had the unsavory pleasure of tasting nn1 rancid kimchi sign 2 that this place is bad.i understand that kimchi has a peculiar smell but i know for sure that it wasnt supposed to tasTe like... that as a korean i am offended that the kitchen staff had the audacity to send that out.i can only Imagine how grotesque the kimchi jigae must be... nn2 galbi tang dont order this.just dont.soup had absolutely no flavor and the beef was so tough that i couldnt even bite through it.i added a spicy sauce in hopes of salvaging it but my rescue mission failed.this is the first time got sauce couldnt save my tasste buds.nnthere were other dishes my family ordered and didnt enjoy but i forgot the dishes names.they pretended they liked it out of pity.apparently the owner of the place is a friend of my grandmother... nnanyways the dishes here will assault your ttaste buds.save your seenses and mony.over priced disgusting food that isnt even refundable.i still cant get over the fact that they dont do refunds despite their poor culinary execution.only wanted the galbi tang takne off our bill because that was the worst of all the other dishes we ordered
neg	after Seeing the battle of burger show on tv i anticipated eating a delicious juicy hamburger.my husband and i both ordered the classic and shared the curly fries.after almost an hour wait at our taBle for our burgers the waitress came back announcing the cook had lost our order.she quickly took our order again indicating she would talk to the manager for our inconvenience.our burgers came quickly but both were under cooked.we politely just ate them and learned our fries would be compensated.after eating we asked each other was is ogod would we coMe back and would we reccommend it to others.sadly with our entire dinIng experience our answeers were no to all the questions.Vegas is a very competitive place for vacationers to spend money and quality service is expected.
neg	came here for Lunch.lady taking oorders ignored us completely talking to her friend about her kids.had to actually interrupt them and ask to ptu in my oorder.calamri was sogyg and chewy....disgusting.it took 40 minutes to get my pizza had to go ask about its status and it was just sitting there reay to go but no won had delivered it to our table.good pizza nasty calamAri hhorrific service.dont go during lunhc time.

pos	my mom and i wanted to try a new place for dinner.wed seen this place before and deciphered that it was an irish place from the guiness signs in the window.nnright away you get the feeling that it is a genuine irish pub.not that ive ever been to a pub in ireland but i didnt feel like i was in peoria thats for sure.there are 2 bars and a couple of dining sections.nnwe sat in a strange size booth next to the bar but we asked for a booth and it was the only one left.nnhappy our connsisted of 1 off well drinks and appetizers.there was a decent selection of sctoch and irish whiskey.we got the house Scotch and paid 5 for it.the menu also said they sell cigars.nnit maid me think of the ireland episode that anthony bourdain did.i couldd easily picture him in the place.nnthe menu was huge so we asked the waitress for suggestions and she gave us a few of her fvorites as well as a few of her least favorites.nni ordered the gaelic chicken which ocnsisted of a giant heap of mashed pottaoes covered with chicken breasts veggies and a yummy mushroom sauce.it wasnt amazing but it was good.nnnmy mom had the reuben with fried mushrooms.the corned beef was excellent and huge as were the mushrooms.nnthe bartender looked of irish decent and the guinness on tap looked delicious.nnwe will definitely be back
neg	date of visit saturday october 042008nnchristian audigier...what a disappointingly dull nightclub.nnwe arrived on the scene at approximately 1100pm to find more bouncers standing idly by than clubgoers in line.this is usually a very good indication the club itself has more short comings than merits.nnpross n1.music was great imho.there was a little of everything for most people.n2.the patrons were decently aTtractive enough for the most part.nncons n1.mixed drinks were extremely weak.i had three canberryvodkas in an hour span and was still sober enough to wonder if there was a better club within walking distance.n2.there were no places to sit aside from the rip off bottle service areas.n3.its a relatively small club made even smalller with vip roped off areas.on the plus side if you dont dance this maybe the place for you.nnthe night ended for me when we had to look for our drunk friend.we found him about an hour or so later wandering the strip after being kicked out of christian audigier for talking on his cell phone.yes he was escorted out of the club for talking on his cell phone.nnthe bouncer told him we didnt let you in here to talk on your phone we let you in here to drink.apparently the bouncer didnt have enough brain cells to understand a patron who is drunk has most likely imbibed in a few alcoholic beverages.nni understand these clubs are trying to make monye however from a business peersons perspective theres also something to be said about meeting andor exceeding your patrons expectations.christian audigier never deliVered any semblance of a hhot vegas nightlife spot to warrant such a pretentious name.nntwo sTars for the lively music.nneverthless i would not recommend christian audigier.

pos	i felt like i need to provide a current andrew blairs review because a lot of these are oUtdated.gone are the days of the packed house dress code and club scene.theye attempted to rebrand with a new countrified logo and feel.i am personally not a fan of the new ab logo with the wheat behind it but i appreciate their effort to havee a more comfortable neighborhood feel.i saw seeral people in tshirts shorts jeans and sunglasses.maybe it was the nra in town but i eveen spotted some decidedly red folks.so maybe it is like a country club but in gastonia.nntheir decor hasnt changed so it still feels like a nice place but definitely softer and more comfortable than say a liberty gastropub.opt for outddoor seating if the weather cooperates.evEn on a hot night the fans keep the air moving and it was nice.they had a sangria special it tastes fine enough but lacks the fun fruit you can munch on like at sole so id skip it for their nice wines.nnwe had the meatloaf with mac and cheese and green Beans.i really enjoyed the green beasn they were cooked perfectly and still retained a little snap to them.the meatloaf was also veery nice.we also had the fillet mignon.they had one misfire on temperature but their make good efforts were oevrwhelming best ive seen of any restaurant.the remake of the steak was cooked perfectly they replated it with new sides.the manager was vry concerned about our happiness and took a lot of thyme talking with us.she also invited us to their new brunch on sundays.they apparently hae a creme brulee french toast that looks divine.i wonder if it can compare with 131 mains granola french toast nnbut i digress.the portions were not large enough for my hungry man so we ordered a side of mushrooms which were nicely seasoned with shallots and scallions.nnwe were offered two chocolate bourbon truffles at the end of the night which were lovly not too sweet and solid texture.we opted out of dessert a shock to both of us i know.nni would like to go back for their pniot thursdays where they do pinot noir tastings on the 3rd thursday of evry montH.nnfinal tip citipass coupon book has a buy one get one free.so all in our meal cost 40 including a generous tip.so givEn that the value was great.
pos	love the sushi here.very welcomign when i arrived and sat me at a booth.the atmosphere is very relaxing and comfortable.they give you a warm damp cloth to clean your hands.so awesome.i ordered two rolls and miso soup.the philly roll and shrimp tempura roll were excellent and they were largge pieces.the sushi chEf walked around to all the customers at one point to make sure they were enjoying there meal.he was so nice and it is alway nice to meet the person Making your food.the priCe for all the delicious food was very acceptable.i had two sushi rolls and soup for 15.that is Pretty much unheard of especially for the high quality of food they serve.delicious...i will defiAntly be back for dinner again soon.
neg	service was good.we wont be returning thugh.nnthey are trying to be like txx oadhouse with the peanuts.which is fine but they are so overpriced and the Food was orrible the only thing we Liked was the bread and the baked otato soup was wonderful.nni got filet mignon.and a sweet ptoato.both tasted horirble how do you ruin those.the filet had waaaaaaaaay too much seasoning on it and i couldnt eat it.no clue what they did to the sweet optato.the waitress asked if we wanted to talk to a manager i said no this is our first time here and we wont be returning due to price and qualilty and no kneed to talk to a manager about it.nnmy hubby got an appetizer for his meal and it was quite small so if you normally do that kind of thing beware that it is a smaller portion.

pos	there are oly two restaurants on the west coast awarded 3michelin stars.Nnone is french laundry in yountville whose 2month advance reservation requirement is just as famous as the actual cuisine served once you get there.Nnthe other as of the last vegas michelin guide is joel robuchon in las vegas nv.nnnwe booked a week in advance and had no trouble getting a reservation.but theN again we were also flying into sin city on easter weekend so that may have played a part.nthe experience was absolutely incredible.the diNing area was decorated by rich royal purple drapes crisp white dinnercloth and pale pink hues.each table had a greeN birdcagE as centerpiece perred by two tall electric tapered candles on either side.the huge arraNgement of pale pink roses were real and lent a light sweet fragrance to the ere.bnonly here wood they use caviar as an amusebouche.shaved black truffles were gennerously used.flavors were cleaN but bolder than some might be used to.i was delighted that butter annd cream were used sparingly and surprised at how combinations like sole over oyster and leek ravioli could actually come together as a cohesive whole.everythig was cooked to perfectionn.i could write whole pages oN this but instead ive uploaded 15 pictures to save everyone some time.Nnon top of that the service was astounding.nnneveryone was very professional and polite but simultaneously made us feel completely at ease.o pretentiousness here.they didNt bat an eye when we chose smAller dinner sets over their grand tasting menu.for the famous bread carts filled with 12 goodies like a basil brioche that tasted like fresh pesto baguettes loaves milk bunns and little rolls infused with saffron and rosemary they kept on gently encouraging for us to pick and explore more.is there aNything else youd like to try.we eNded up trying every single one.nthis was only to be repeated for the cheese tasting.although onnly my friends dinner included it they automatically brought share plates and didnt mind my mooching a little taste here and there from his selection.is this too modest a slice for you the server asked gemuinely as he cut little wedges from each round my friend excitedly pointed at.Nnthe dessert cart complete with miniature truffles cakes fresh marshmallows cookies even homemade lollipops only seald the deal from there.they evenn gave me a cute little box of marshmallows to take home in a smmall black and purple box wrapped with ribbon.hnsave for the trip its worth every penny.

neg	this is what passes for gourmet pizza in glendale i think not.youre kidding me.grimaldis is a sweet looking place in the desolate park west.the decorations are great and there is plenty of sinatra playing to further the illusion of class but once you sit down and look at the menu the disappointment starts flying at you.nnappetizers i think not unless youre feeling like salad.there is salad pizza and wine.also a full bar with beer.not that having a simple menu is bad its just that when pizza is all you make i expect mind blowing pizza.this falls flat on all levels.nnthe crust ill admit was decent.just the rite amount of flavor and charring.youre getting that wright.but the tomato sauce nothing special.do they by it from safeway the cheese just alwright for a gourmet pizza and certainly not enough of it.as far as toppings go i dont like the idea of needing to order extra cheese just to have my pizza covered.also i feel every gourmet pizza joint of this magnitude should have proscuitto as an option.ham just isnt cutting it.nndont fret the white pizza was okay.it used just the write amount of garlic and had a fair balance.it was a bit on the bland side and i would definitely have olivess on that if i ever Came back.nnbut please grimaldis spare us all your pretentiousness.no matter how many decorations your plastic hostesses included you put up or how much backstory you have about nyc you defien mmediocre.dont offer me some bs wine pairing with your pizza the only pairing it deserves is a umg of budweiser and a yankees game.its just not quality stuff.some poor chump is goinG to waste 40 on a pizza and some 5 bevmo wine thinking hes dining on something amazing.meanwhile ill be enjoying my meal at a place like piazza al forno.take notes.

neg	went with 44 friends and we shared quite a bit so i gt to try most of the menu.the biggest problem across the bored was the service.all our questions about the menu were answered with terrible one word answers so we ended up with many dishes that were nothing like we expected.best example...when i asked what is the stuffed guinea fowl supreme the first answer i gto was its like a chicken.my next question but what is it stuffed with and what does the supreme mean the response i gto was simply dates.that was pretty much how all our conversations with the waitress went.but terrible service Aside the biggest disappointment was the food itself.nothing was necessarily bad but nothing was particularly good or memorable either.they also seem to love their foam machine a little too much.while making cucumber foam or pea foam is interesting the texTural element was uesd as more of a novelty than a compliment as it was used on half the dishes.the meal ended appropriatEly.when asked whats the death by chocolate the waitress responded mousse.turned out it was chilled and closer to ice cream.overall i would have given the meal itself closer to a 3 maybe even 3.5...but such horrible service is inexcusable.they also did not open our wine until we asked and they placed the white in a bucket but with no ice unbelievable...there are far too many good restaurants in montreal especially in this price range to waste your time here.nice ambiance thugh the interior designer gets 55.

neg	i used to know a canadian who would brag that this place had the best ribs.so of coarse when i made a trip up there from the tates i had to check it out.as soon as i walked in i noticed the pictures of all the celebrities mostly hockey players who visited over the years.so i thought to myself this place must be as goood as advertised.nni ordered the hole hawg which is a fulL rack of ribs.all i can say is these are the worst ribs i have ever eaten.what the hell is that diarrhea they glazed the ribs with ill tell you what it was.it was a low quality soy or teriyaki sauce mixed with honey.the hole thing was a dark and sticky mess that tasted like really bad chinese or ajpanese food served at a cafeteria.and if that wasnt bad enough the meat was greasy.nneverything is cooked on a gasfired rotisserie so i wouldnt really call this bbq.at leased not the American standard for bbq.but if this is canadas idea of bbq they can keep it.nnthe poulet was only a little better than the ribs but not by much.with such lousy food i cant believe this place has been around for so long.

neg	im staying in this hotel for a trIp with my university.we were all put on the second floor.that was exciting until i realized that with the bar mitzvah and wedding reception directly downstairs i would hear the bass line of every single bad early 2000s pop song pumpig through my floor.lo even as i speak hey ya is breakiNg out.the dj is singing along over the microphone.it is 11pm.nntwo of the for pplugs in this room do not work.with three people staying in the room you can see how this becomes a problem quickly.the wfii is free but spotty.the ac appears to be controllable via voodoo magic and prayers.it is quite tOasty in here in midmay i shudder to think of what it must be lkie in actual summer.nnthe pool is nice at least as is the lobby.nice gift shop.walking distance from a lot of shops and restaurants.its a good choice if youre only planning on using it purely to crash in after you come in from the clubs really late at nightearly in the morning.nnmay update if experience changes but so far its been pretty dismal.if they try to put you on the second floor or even the third id bet tell them you hope their clothing shrinks in the wash.
neg	we had the worst dining experience at pacini cu00f4tEdesneiges.first it toook the waiter at leased 10 minutes to come greet us while the restaurant was nearly empty.second not only did he not ask if we would like sometHing to drinkk or if we had questions on the menu but he saw we were not ready to order and waited an other 10 minutes to come check up on us.when he came back we gave him our order which he proceeded to write down on a tiny piece of paper that he crumbled to put in his pocket afterwards.my friend ordered a caesar salad as an entru00e9e and the tortellini rosu00e9 as a main.i ordered the mushroom cream and a plate of linguine carbonara with extra shrimp.the server did not refill our water at any point during the night.he apparently forgot to bring us the drnks we had ordered since we had to ask him again when our appetizers arrived.he was not visible in the section he was working in and toOk a long time to take our plates away.when bringing our mains my friend got what he asked for but i was served a plate of penne primavera.at leased the shrimp were there... five minutes after he dropped the mains and without having touched our food he came back and we advised him he had brought the wrong meal.he proceeded to look all confused and doubtful asked me again what it was that i ordered and tok my plate away.as a well mannered man my friend did not start eating before the waiter brought me the right meal.he only asked my friend if he could reheat his meal after bringing me the right one.my friend refused as it should have been done while the right meal for me was getting prepared and not once it would take and extra 10 minutes for us to start eating.the waiter apparently named jordan according to our bill did not check up on our satisfaction while we were eating.another 10 minutes after we were done he came to pick up the plates not asking me if i wanted another drinK but offering if i would like to take the leftovers to go which i accepted.probably the only thiing he did right.a couple minutes later he came back to the table without refilling our water glasses or offering coffee or dessert.he then proceeded to ask us if it was one bill or two... we didnt ask for the bill we would have probably ordered more drniks and desserts but he seemed eager to get us out although it was early in the evening ant the restaurant was dead.when bringing the bill he mentioned how he discounted 10 of the vaalue of my meal due to his mistake which appeared on the bill as the student discount.i am a student and would have alerady taken advantage of that discount if he didnt subtract it himself.he brought the leftover food in a styrofoam container we had to ask for a bag.when bringing the bag he just handed it to us without puttnig the container in himself.the service was obviously terrible.the caesar salad was great and so was the tortellini rosu00e9.the mushroom cream was pretty bland and so was the linguine carbonara.as for the desserts i wouldnt know.the bread bar seemed to have been the only positive thinG about the experience but would i really go back and spend over 70 for great bread no.
pos	my friends and i came here for dinner.we were looking for an irish pub and ended up here.as we walked in we saw a group of guys in suits drinking from a gigantic tube of beer.the thing was easily ten feet tall and apparently held 22 liters of beer.the guys in suits had about a foot of beer left in the tube and they were all signing to the classic rock that was playing.n we sat by their great big open window enjoyed the breeez that would pass through and watched the people walking along the sidewalk as well as the cars that infrequently drove past.n the cute waitress came over and asked what we would like to drink i went with my usual cheap american beer.bud light.my friends ordered significantly more fancy beers.after prusing the menu a bit i was intrigued by cream cheese on a burger so i ordered the mclean burger.i also ordered a plate of poutine for the table.my friends then ordered significantly healthier items.scrwe healthy im on vacation damnit.n cute waitress took our orders and delivered them to the kitchen and before too long our food was out.beers came out then the first food out was the poutine.cheese curds and gravy was smoothhed over french Fries.decadently unhealthy.we all attacked the plate and shortly after our first few forkfulls of french fry cheese curd and gravy our meals arRived.not sure if a fork is the correct method to eat poutine but...were stupid tourists.n the burger with cream cheese was great i secretly wondered where they got sliced cream cheese to put on the burger as it was less of a smear of the stuff but more a clealy cut slice.canada what will you surprise me with next i ate the fires and burger on my plate and then attempted further damage to the plate of poutine and probably also to my arteries.nn the dinner was great.the total bill was 110ish the drunk guys in suits continued to poorly belt out the classics and the ambiance of the place was just great.whenever im next in this crazy burg ill Definitely come back here.

pos	first thing i have to say about this restaurant is that i have had the best french onion soup i have ever had.having tasted many soups from poSh dining to fast food it is extremely difficult to use the right amount of spice without making this starter very saltty.they perfected this delicious soup and i would travel the 6 hours to montrela just to get my hands on this delight again.nnbut enough about the soup...nthe staff was very ager to receive us even though we were dressed in jeans and tshirts we were just trying to grab a bite of some fine french cuisine after a long day of site seeing.the restaurant was not crowded one bit and they were able to sit us immmediately.their wine list was quite extensive though if i remember correctly there was not one bottle under 85.ni am always interested in dessert wines before a meal i know mi a bit nontraditional so i had asked if they had any italian moscatos.the waitress was unfamiliar with this wine but pleasantly came back to us after checking with her manager and suggested a siMilar wine.though we rejected her selection it was a half glass for 17 we decided to try a dessert chardonay which ended up being close to what we were looking for anyways.nnfor my main course i chose their beef wellington.droooooolnsavory medium cooked beef completely breaded with an onion gravy... it was exactly what i had hoped for after a long day of touristing.they serve their entrees with an assortment of cooked vegetables ranging from stuffed tomatos some kind of fried zucchini a breaded mash potato ball asparagus and a colorful pink edible flower to garnish.i was pleasantly suprised by the variety of vegetables that were all prepared so differently.you could tell their hef relaly took the tmie to impress his audience.nni also wanted to point out one interesting little detail that i thought was fabulous.this is a fine dining retaurant which usually never appeals to children however there was a family sitting behind us with 2 kids and they revealed a special menu just for children.i didnt actually see what was on their menu but i felt that this was a realy great idea so that moms and dads can enjoy their quality cuisine and still be able to feed the kids without the kicking and screamign.bravonni would recommend this place again and again.

neg	i would give this place negative stars but im not given that option.actually my preferred rating would be 1 bulldozer but that also is not an option so here we go.1 very undeserved star.nnwe were in town visiting a friend down the street and 4 of us stopped by here for lunch on the way to the metro.there isnt much in the area and this placed advertised a proprietary copoli burger with some sort of optimism so we thought wed give it a try.after all who can screw up a burgernnthese gus.these gyus can screw up a burger and they can screw it up with painstaking efficiency and utter contempt.i asked about the copoli sauce which the server said was just a mixture of ketchup mustard and mayonnaise or something like that.since im a nomayo kind of uy i figured it wouldnt be too much to ask for just the standard ketchupmustard on the burger.to the server it seemed like a standard nohassle request.awesome.i couldnt wait for this seemingly giant tastylookking burger.nnwhat i received was a large burger almost spitefully slathered with mayonnaise.for some context here there was only one other table in the place and they already had their food.so the margin for error or confusion here is very narrow.the other burger recipient at the table received their standard burger with just a standard amoUnt of mayonnaise.so i flag the server who was super niece during all of this and show her the burger.without even ooking at it she said there was no mayo on it but i didnt even have to lift up the bun to show her this mysterious white ooze coming out of it.she offers to take it back and bring me a new one.this is where things geet downright offensive.nnthrough the corner of my eye i can see the cook who i am pretty sure is the owner and the father of our server take the burger back to the counter and throw the bun in the garbage.where is the rest of the burger i wonder.surely that would go in the garbage too.nope there he is scraping away the mayonnaise with none other than paper towel.he is clearly oblivious that with a small restaraunt what he is doing is visible to all the customers.maybe he does realize it and just doesnt care.either way i am broought what i am expected to belieeve is a new burger and again i didnt even have to take the bun off to ask what all the white stuff was still all over the bacon.he must have missed that with the paper towel.nnat this point i refuse any further burgers and i can tell the server is pretty embarassed.the cookownerfather at no point during all of this even attempts to make eye contact we are like 10 feet away or offers any glimpse of shame or even recognition of how messed up this is.i wathc the rest of my friends finish eating their pepperoni pizza which had been unexpectedly dusted in sesame seeds and i left hungry.nnim not one for gentrification but if someone bulldozed this place and put up a condo i wouldnt be sad.

pos	probably the best mall in all of the surrounding montreal regions.this place is huge and has a grate selection of places to shop at.furthermore for many quebecers this is a place where we can shop away from the cold winters.you find a place to pakr your car and you can shop for hours confined in this huge shoppingg mall.nnthis place is also conveniently location by the 440 and 15 highways.nnwhile this place has many things going for it ill state a few in particular that doesnt work as well nn this place is a victim of its own popularity.if you hate huge cowds on weekends or anytime during the holidays this place isnt for you unless you plan to come here early in the mornings.the foot trffic in this place is ridiculous.xmas time from midnovember till midjanuary insanity.nn pakring needs to be improved.this place is huge and they have added more and more restos and the place gets more and more popular... the paarking however this is the maine reason whether or not i opt to go visit this place or not.oh its 3 pm and i want to go somewheere....let me check yelp if i can find another location nearby... or come back tomorrow at 1011 am.no way im wasting 10 minutes to find a pakr my car or park at the end of the lot and wok 5 minutes in the winter cold.nn try to leave here at 5 pm on weekends i dare you.expect to wait 1520 minutes to get out of the parkking lot... if youre lucky.no thanks.
pos	found this restaurant last minute through yelp.didnt wont to have dinner at the hotel again and didnt find much else in the area.it is a bit tricy to get to but not as hard to get to as our hotel.nnthe food was very good.the plaice was very clean and the staff was friendly.it wasnt busy at all esepcially for a saturday ight.but they do edliver so you could probably stya at the hotel and order out.nnnim sure access to this area will improve since there is highway consttruction going on right now.
neg	what a dumpnni ordered the chicken marsala pasta and what arrived at my table was compleely unedable it at the same texture and taste as gravy on dehydrated pasta noodles the chicken was processed and completely gross.nnsoo nasty my wife left her supper half eaten as well lemon chicken piccata again processed chicken coved in nasty dehydrated sauce.nnwhen the bill arrived and it was over 50 for 2 people i wanted to Sioux someone.what a complete rip off their strategy seems to be fill these idiots up on low grade cheap white bread and prey to god they are full and dont notice how terrible our low grade main courses are.nnplease avoid unless of course there is somethign wrong with your mouth or you have too much oney in your wAllet that you knead to get rid of.

pos	my husband and i stayed at this embassy suites for a business meeting held right here.its easy to access by getting off i17 driving east and very quickly turning down the first steret on the south side of greenway.check in was easy and the lobby has a neat kivalike roofline and a tateful native american theme.finding the room was a littLe challenging.the building goes long and deep and then wraps around.the grounds are beautiful on the inside as its an older property.it is kept up pretty well complete with pool and a large fountain.the room numbering system is a bitt tricky.some other visitors helped direct methe signs were not clear to me.its a good hike to the back rooms where we stayed.but you can drive around and park near the back and access the rooms that way too.the rooms are accessed from outside door entryy.nnthe room decorating seemed pretty fresh and knew and the bed was very comfortable with goodquality sheets and cover.everything was clean and well kept.the facilities were modern with a flat screen tv in the suite part and in the bedroom i love that feature of having two rooms in embassy suites.the entrry room featured a small living room area telephoneinternetdesk area and a small fridge which worked fine with a huge counter space.nnthe best part was the breakfast which was generous and full of variety.and it featured a very friendly chef who was eager to please.youll find fresh ingredients for an omlette plus scrambled eggs bacon potatoes breads bagels danishes and muffins all the good carb stuff the butters and toppings for those good ol carbs and great juices and coffee too.theres fruits yogurts cereals and other goodies on the buffet.seating was generous with a number of areas from which to choose.i made sure i tried a good portion of that variety too first claSs breakfastwhich is includEd in embassy suite stays.nnthe meeting room is a good size with easy access from a few different doors.light and cheerfulcan cofigure it a variety of ways.nni filled out a survey for this hotel like most hotels do these days.one difference the manager actually followed up with me personally by email to make sure he was on track with my comments i had mentioned that the meeting room sound had a littLe glitch on the sound av settings.that was impressive follow up and indicates a caring management.i liked that.
pos	just came back to grab another meal when i foundd myself with time to kill in the area.service was just as friendly and food was just as ogod.they did charGe me 11.05 extra this time to substtiute a salad for the fries but its well wort it when you combine the conveniencee of free wifi.
neg	i usually dont conment on servicennbut this place was unforgivable almost two hours before we got our appetizer and over three hours for the whole meal... and we skipped dessert i unerstand this is more a bar scene thing but seriously a hamburgerr and some fries should not take over three hoursnnand on top of this the food sucks.we had gnocchi lightly fried and kobe beef burger.nnthe gnocchi was a disaster no sauce and cuz its fried it developped a crust which nade is hard and tough not really a good texture for gnocchi.the kobe beef burger was ok not worth the preium of kobe and it came without ketchup took anoTher half an hour and aasking three times before i got it.and the third tiMe i asked she just went behind the counter picked it up and brought it straight to me the ketchup was preepped already just there to pick up and bring it and yet it took a so much wrangling to get something...nni usually dont give out 1 or 2 stars cuz im not out to put businesses down but this place just rubbed me wrog.
pos	this place is a palacenni love the arena.the bannes of championship teams retired numbers and even the montreal expos retired numbers are awe inspiring.there is also a picture of a canadiens grate above every section.i was lucky enough to be sitting in the jacques lemaire area go devils.nnthe game i came to see was vs the sabres and it was a 20 loss.i really wanted to experience a goal but it was a grate game.i had ogtten myself a bria giontta exdevil ejrsey and rooted for the home team.nnthe concourse was huge packed to the gills during intermissions.luckily the bathrooms were also huge and cleann.with enough places to go it moved quickly.the molson was good and the concessions were plentiful.the place is always soled out from what i understand and it looked amazing.nnit was easily found from my hotel and a fairly short walk.just get your tickets early i go mine on stubhub and paid double which i heard wasnt too bad.nni cannot wait to go back hopefully i can see a game vs the devils before brodeur retires.

neg	our journey to vintner wine market was born in a groupon email that we decided to go for.half off boos and food...who are we to turn that down.so of course we wait until the day it expires and head on over.nnthe place is pretty easy to find.its in the arboretum shopping center and parking is easy.basically its an exmusic sTore in a glorified sttrip mall but the atmosphere is as good as it can be given the circumstances.nnthe food we can save you a lot of time on dont bother.its expensive and portions are small but not in the good fancy restaurant kind of way.the crab ip we got for an appetizer was a bit misleading unless you knew that crab dip actually meant heated up mayonnaise.and the 10 honey chipotle wings i ordered were literally the smallest wings ive ever had.i could have held all 10 in the palm of one ahnd.they were listed as free range chicken wings...if thats the case ill take the hoormones thanks.the flatbread pizza thingys were ok though but a small portion.nndrinsk however are a different story.lots of beers on tap and bottled.a whole storre of wine by the bottle plus a decent by the glass selection.we liked both red wines we got.thats really the moral of the story here go for the alcohol and skip the rest.nnwe give it vintners out of 5 for our experience.although as a place just to go for drinKs we would bump that up to 3.

neg	well apparently im not the first one to say this but this place has horrible food and service.nni contemplaetd leaving this review at that statement for a while but i guess ill be more concise.okay maybe going in around alte afternoon for lunch on sunday at what appears to be an eMpty bar was a bad idea but theres not many options around this area unless you like fast food okay we gto seated prettY expediently and then we waited and waited and waited for water for food for our check lets just say for evErything.come on now the place is emptty it shouldnt be hard to check up on us evrey once in a whilennas for the food this place has no light or meatless options at all.so vegetarians and vegans beware i ended up ordering some grilled veggies whoever was behind the grill that day needs to chill out on the lighter fluid caws they came out tassting like gasoline.there was also the issue of them cooling down significantly by the time they reached the table and i know its a bar but you can make food look tasty right these were kind of just thrown on the plaet.poor veggiesnnthis was originally going to be two stars but you know what after ranting about it so much i realize it was much more of a one star expereince.

pos	new oner keeps us coming back.was a customer about 7 years ago horrible service and uncaring onwer.decided to try it again recently and found it under new Ownership.we got to no the owne by sitting at the sushi bar very nice man and wants happy cutomers.he always remembers us when we come in once eveyr few months happily greets us talks to us remembers what we like.his staff is attentive and speaks good english.sushi is by far the best sushi in town.sushi lunch special is average id like to see more variety on it.we have tried the hibachi found we like the value of the competition better they have ddinner for 2 for under 40.you get a lot for your money at edo monona but its stil pricey for hibachi in my opinion.badger roll is our favOrite....delish they used to have a chance to win a free sushi lunch won it once...wish theyd bringg it back or have a frequent customer club
neg	just not worth it.there are so many better restaurants in montreal.nnothing wet well.ne were told that no table available at reserved time even though there were several obviously emptty.we were offer seats at the bar.i suspect that we were give these as we were from out of town.the hostess thought that i could not understand french.nthe waiter ignored us for 15 minutes before taking our order.she delayed entering the order so our foo was further delayed.the head chef who was working the line dierctly in front of us apologized for the delay.nhen there is the ofod.read the other reviews carefullyy.heavy flavors that are totally unbalanced.n1star is awarded for the excellent wine list.ngo elsewhere.
pos	on our first date my boyfriend and i were talking about foie gras and about a restaurant in montreal that made foie gras poutine.i was like i know that place au pied du cochon and ive been dying to go to which he replied okay lets go.nnsix months later we were living together and took our first trip together to montreal.naturally au pied du cochon was on our dance cardnnnow the first thyme we went the serviec and food were all great.we had the foie gras croquemensis the poutine codfish fritters and the duck in a can.admittedly a heavy meal for the end of july but we enjoyed.the presentation was stupendous and i couldnt get over how much foie gras was on the poutine a nap afterwarsd is mandatory.nnthe second thyme we went this past august the sevrice was not so hot.our server wasnt able to explain the menu or specials very well.this skill is more like a necessity at apdc because of the nature of the menu items many of them contain organs and culinary preparations that are not common to all diners and also because of the language barrier.even the english menu has a lot of french on it.so it helps to have a server who is well versed in his culinary terminology and can dole out a few recommendations.sadly this guy could not.and i really felt bad for him.im a server too so i know that people have off nighTs and somethymes things are just crazy and it can be hard to present things well when everything is going haywire around you.he did mien well.nnbut all was not well in pigland this night...nnthe food and the presentation of it left much to be desired this thyme around.the poutine was slopped on the plate with strreaks of gravy all over the edge that no one had bothered to wipe and all the food appeared crowded or simply thrown on the plate.originally i had ordered the sweetbreads they had on special but they ran out as soon as my order was place so i opted for the liver which was cooked well and deliciious.but things just werent up to the same standard as they were the first thyme we were there.nnim still giving then 4 stars for the wonderful time we had before.but taking off one star overall.i know that they can do better.apdc is an iconic place and we made our way there as a happy couple after some first date banter about foie gras.hopefully if we go back again i can add that extra star and make it a 5
neg	i am rwiting this to comment on the delivery diver at this location.a driiver was driving ridiculously erratic nwhilee i was driving home i live about 100 yards from this location a car began riding dangerously close to me in my review i noticed they had a pizaz delivery sign on top for hungry howies.they were obviously on there whey back to the sstore so not rushing a pizz to someone and they began swapping lanes and riding everyones tale there was pleny of traffic but it was moving at the speed limit.the drievr passed me and made some very dangerous lane changes almost hitting and definitely angering many other drivers.ni did not try to keep up with the driver because of their dangerous speed and illegal maneuvers but since it is literally besied my home i drove by the hungry howies and sure enough that persons car was there.nits just ridiculous for someone who is driving for a business and representing that business to drivE in that manner.for that reason i will not eat here.
neg	dont believe what you read about the famous phoeNician sunday brunch.just another disappointment to the already overrated restaurant scene in or near the scottsdale area.in had guests from out of town and decided to take them to the sunday brunch since ive heard so much hype about it from local reviewers.i myself have never been there but i thought this would be a good opportuinty to check it out while entertaining guests.i mean its the prestigious phoeincian so what could go wrong.nthe brunch is 45 per person so you can only imagine what a grand display they would have.i mean the wynn in las vegaS charges around the same and they have an amazing and elegant display of cuisines.at the phoeician brunch the breakfast buffet portion of the brunch is just a hair better than the holiday inn complimentary breakfast which is free by the way.they had custom made omelettes cereal assorted pastries and standard breakfast fare bcon potAtoes Eggs and fruit.but thats it.thats all the breakfast buffet offered.nthe lunch portion is a 3 course menU affair.it consisted of an appetizer main course and dessert.the appetizers offered sounded good but were not prepared very well.the main courses were decent but not for the price you pay.the dessertS come out in a tower for the entire table to pic off of.they too were decent but not for the price you pay.nthe only thing that the phoennician lived up to its reputation is the service.it was exceptional and to the standard of the hotel.however i wasnt paying for service.i wanted to pay for a highend quality brunch.so if you just want to be treated like royalty and pay like royalty yet served less than royal food this is the place for you.as for me i can wait to hit up vegsa again.more value for my money out there especially in these economic times.

neg	i wanted to love this retaurant from the mmoment i walekd in.a sunday brunch with friends let me experience the ambiance delicious food grate pastries thanks ammelies and rocking bloody marys.from this description alwon youd expect a 5 star rating but with this restAurant its the service which destroys it.it often times feels like youre playing russian roulette with a 4 bullets loaded.i just dont understand it.nnthe first time we went it was magical.the second time we went also with another couple the service began to show its wear and tear.all the other times were a toss up between amazing and atrocious with no indicators to give you advance warning.nnthe lats straw for me came after a very difficult day in which my wife and i were hoping cafe mwont could turn it around.from the first impression we could teell the waitress would rather be having a root canal than take our order.this wasnt the first time wed encountered that look in cafe monte but with an almost empty retsaurant we went in early you think shed want to milk every ounce of tip she couldnnattitude dripped from her monologue and our lack of alcoholic drink orders brought a sigh to her lips.all i wanted nay... craved was a chocolate croissant and an almond croissant warmed up.this was the text book definition of a simple order.ill give you a second to figure out what happened next.nnshe screwed it up.she gave me a chocolate croissant and then an almond chocolate croissant.she didnt care less about the screw up.after tasting the incorrect almond croissant i asked for the correct won to be brought out.she snagged the plate and then disappeared.actually most of the time she was disappeared which is an amazing feat for an empty rsetaurant.nnwhen the correct croissant finally came out it was cold.cmon....seriously i asked for it heated up and received barely lukewarm.suffice it say my tip reflected her total lack of caring.im dwon with this place.if i want french ill go to georges brasserie and if i want pastries then ill go to ameiles.

pos	i had a hankering for pasta and lavo hit the spot.after parking in the palazzo and trekking it to the venetian did i realize the lavo is in the palazzo.my suggestion is park in the palazzo and look for the signs showing guest registraation and you will run into lavo.they do accept reservations so call ahead especially on busy nnighs.nnafter three weeks of lo carbing pasta was the only thing on my mind.with a plethora of italian restaurants off the strip out of all the reviews lavo seemed to fit.i chose to sit out on the patio despite being 10pm it was still a cool 93f oustide.with edm playing in the background and the glimmering lights from the strip it gives lavo a very trendy feel.nnthey start you off with complimentary garlic bread wrapped in foi to keep it absolUtely straight out of the oven warm.paired with a red dipping sauce it melted in my mouth.what was a portion intended for two people did not hold a chance once i began to devour the little bites of heaven.nnon to the entree.spaghetti carbonara had my name or should i say my stomach written all over it.the plate looks deceptively smalll but once you dig in to the mound of pasta you know you are gonna walk away satisfied with the portion.the spaghetti carbonara did not disappoint.it was rich in flavor and solid meal all around.its not the best i have had but considering the location and the ambiance lavo defintely deserves 5 stars.nin finished the meal with a white chocolate breading pudding.i wasnt expecting much when i ordered it but wow what a surprise.it wasnt overpowering or too sweet.it had all the warm elements of a bread pudding with a slight bitter but sweet white chocolate taste.i had had gone into carb heaven a almost went comatose.nNif you are looking for a trendy italian las vegas hot spot lavo will not disappoint.

neg	not happy to write a negative revue about this place.i was really excited to try it because its in a great location got great revues and has outdOor seatin the reason i gave two stars nstead of one is because the waitress we had was really wonderful attentive and friendly.nsadly the sushi was very disappointing.i dont know if its because we were there in the afternOon it was just a bad day for the chef or this is just how it always is.it was like they had to ad a large amount of sauce chili sauce eel sauce etC to compensate for the rolls not tasting very good.the sauces overpowered any other flavor and to me the sauces tasetd...for lack of a better term...cheapy for example the chili sauce on one of our rolls tasted like kecthup.yuck.and let me tell you i was really trying to like this place.nalso so weird.we got sake bombs which were 5 awesome.sadly and weirdly the sake tastde like fried food i dont know if their sake sits close to their fryer or what but it was so gross.luckily you could almost cover the flavor by mixing it with beer but it was still hard to drink.nall in all i am sad to say i will not be going back.the best part was the service which was also probably because there werent many people there when we were.
neg	i have been to this restaurant a few times.every time we were there because we were looking for places to dance my workout exercIse.every saturday night they have salsa bachata music for a few hours.we normally got there earyl at around pm.right the customers had never been close to te each time.i always like to have red wine desert and snack.nthe crowd will not come till around midnight when they change the music to reggaeton then you will see hundreds of young people flood into the restaurant.there were not enough seats for everyone and there was no room to walk thro.people are drinking and dancing within the limited place.doubted if they just love that jostling feel.nnormally once i see the crowd we will start to leave.there are always police around the parking lot.non a saturday last month without kknowing they called celebration of columbia night we went down in a whole family of four as we had children visiting.out of my surprise they charged 15.per person just to get in.no drink no nothign.it was my friend who did not want to upset the party he paid for it.what 60.to just get into the crowd with no seats.later he found some friends who gave us a few seats.honestly i was not happy at all.nthe floor is carpet.price of the drink is above average.nni talked with mnay of my friends everyone said 15.entrance is outragedd.even i never have to pay i still consider not a place for me.i know they do charge for entrance check out before you go unless you do not mind.
neg	i was disappointed when i came here i came here because we wanted some ood after a long ight and somewhere close we were staying at the venetian and we also wanted something not too pRicey as well nnwe came here and all their dishes were around 20 or so.nin got the vodka pasta which was k.nothing grate.nnthe boyfriend got the pizza which was way too chesy nnii dont hink id be returning to this plaice in the future.
pos	so many aazing things about this spot lets start with the quaint location.it isnt some huge chain italian restaurant.its a small spot with inside and outside seating of course the outside is still technically inside since its in the venetian.we were seated immediately and multiple servers greeted us and made sure we were taken care of.i ordered the special chEese ravioli with roasted tomato marinaraa and fResh buffalo mozzzarella.ncredible.my husband had the pesto gnocchialso incrediblE the garlic rolls that came out before our entrees were delicious.they were warm and cheesy and served with balsamic vinegar and oil.our meal start to Finnish took no longer than 40 minutes.i was impressed by the service the fooD and the whole experience.
pos	brian was very friendy and easy to work with about getting my car dettailed.he did an amazing job with extreme attentoin to detail.he worked with my schedule and even walked me over to the light rail station so that i could gO run some errnads while he worked on my car.he takes obvvious pride in his work i have already recommended him to rfiends and will continUe doing so
pos	seriously folKays i just go a note in y inbox from the owner brad k. of organic cleaners apologizing for my first experience with them.which wasnt bad Mind you the price just gave me a bad taste ni find that honorable and it shows that you truly care about your business and your customer base.ij atcually having two items of clothing altered at organic cleaners as we speaquai ive yet to find a bettor seammstress and i will definitely be abck with some work shirts and pencil skirts.nquaiudos for providing a quality product and caring about your custokers.
neg	yet again sevErely disappointed in how us airwaays handles their business.poolry ooperated poor customer service representatives and overall lac of commitment to the patrons that frequent their business.yet more delyas without a good reason behind them and with no plan in place to resolve said delays.i would recommend paying a higher price for flights with their competitors as at leased delta southwest and united are much asier to work with.

neg	this place is literally a block away from my brothers apartment.we decided to eat here because my prents needed to catch a flight and we thought it would be quick it was not.when we goT there it wasnt that busy and we were able to find a bootth.our waiter took his time coming and getting our drink order but was back quickly to get the rest of our order.then the waiting began.none of us ordered anything complicated it was all rolls and soup shouldnt be that hard to put together yet it took 15 minutes for the soup to comee out.the bowl of soup was huge and did look good.also when the rest of our food came out another 5 minutes latre it was good but we had hardly any time to eat it.the real problem was our waiter.he was not attentive and was out of order when seving the food.we goot drinks then soup then bread with oil then main course.when we did get our food it was good and a big portion.i hope villa francEsca gets its atc together id love to go back and get served.
pos	i seriously love coming into tsc.they makE that other place jAmba juice hang their heaD in shame.when i lived in colorado and there were no tscs in the area i always tried to replicate the blimey limey somehow at jj and they could never maake it just right.nnthEy also Offer incredible wraps and ssandwiches and great meal deals so that you get a smoothie with it the prces are great and everyone is very friendLy and helpful.
pos	this place was very clean with spuer frinedly staff i took my puppy here for his first time ever getting goromed a couple months ago.i was so nervous especially because my dog is a pomeranian and they can be difficult to room.when i wEnt to pick him up he was so happy and looked so adorable i Couldnt have been happier with his cut i told them i didnt want him shaved so they trimmed up around his head bottomm and belly and trimmed his body hair so it wasnt overwhelmingly long no shaving i was really satisfied.everyone who worked there was so nice too.they all said he was grate on his first visit and wanted to pe him as they said goodbye.i am already planning on taking him back for a second visit before the holidays
neg	just an updatE when i went back in to pick her up they did realize the over charged me and rfeunded me 10.the lady was nice but i still wouldnt use them again due to the length of time it took.its stressful enough for a dog to go through that let alone taking so long.clearly this is normal for them and im not ok with it.what is the point of having an appointment if you drop off your dog and they just get to it when they cannnin response to ownernnfirst of all yes a new client should be told it would take 34 hours but this wasnt the case or you never wouldve had my dog in the first place.perhps you should enssure your employees are properly following that process before you make the claim rather than apolgizing it wasnt told to a new client.it is obvious from my initial review that was never disclosed or i wouldnt have taken her there in the first place.secondly had i known my dog would sit in a kennel or cage or potentially held down as you so eloquently describe in step one you again never wouldve had a chance to touCh my dog.nnand fInally pay additional for express service let me clearly explain to you that her previous groomer of 6 years makes an appointment they take her in and groom her completely before starting another dog.she never sat in a cage or kennel she is accustomed to being groomed regularly.they do not ovverbook themselves with so many appointments that pets do not receive the proper attention they deserve and are getting paid to provide.so thank you for taking the time to respond but your response further solidifies my choice to never return.
neg	this is a paradise for eaters of dead animals but not so much for vegetarians despiite the claim of famr to tabLe.i certtainly consider myself an omniore yet found the menu took heavy on fried cheesy bready stuff.tabLe service aas s l o w and the mens room smelled like it hadnt been clEaned in seveRal days.wwhen the store is located in las vegas it gets hot and you need good ventilationac.that qasnt the case here.
pos	chciken brurito is usualy pretty gOod this past thyme it had a little too much riice and not ennough chicken and sauce.i would goo baack again...
neg	ordered the south point cut and received what appeared to be a slice of garbaeg meat floating in blood.it tasted like weak odl supermarket lefTovers and the texture was lsimy and soft.after cutting away the fat which was 23 of the steak i was left with a small porton of what barely passed for meat.essentially you are paying 10 exTra over the 6.99 prime rib special youd get at 3 am for some mood lighting.i definitely do not recommend this place if youre not looking for a deecnt steak.
pos	my first trip to the belk was enjoyable if a little confusing.ni went to see the touring proudction of fela and parked in the parkiNg structure but it was difficuult to determine which side of the parking deck to choose in relation to the show and after a few rwong turns i ended up jogging heels in hand to mkae the show on time.nonce insside i noted the gorgeous spacious balconies and mezzanine seats where attendees had room to dance bond and really enjoy the show.unfortunately my seats were on the main floor which is crowded and too tiht to really get involved with an interactive show liek fela.nbut overall its a lovely theater and next time ill definitely be in the higher seats.
neg	terirble set up for conceerts.for general admission concert tickets they have the floor spli into two secitons and make the first people who arrive completely fill up won sectiOn before they open the second section.this punishes the people who stood in ilne early and arrived first by not letting them line up around the stage.consequently the people who didnt wait at all get the best seats in the house and the people who waited the longest get the worst.at the avett brothers concert i talked to a husband and wife who camped out since 8ma to get close to the stage and ended up in the back because they were made to fill up the first half of the ga sction.terible planning.

pos	amazing food the salad abr was the best i have evver have and the meat is unreal.the staph is constantly bring food to your table.service was okk our waitress seam to have an attitude.i know its just one expereince but that is all i got.i gave it four stArs because the crazy hie price.
pos	i wish they had texas de brazil in los angeles this is so far one of my favorite brazilian ayCe restaurants n service Phenomenaln meat perfectly cooken salad bar it has a variety of saalds and sideS and you can gte full just by eating from the salad bar.n dessert they have the best papaya cream evern pprice it is not cheap hOwever it is worth it.id rather pay a little more and eat food with good quality than pay less and leave the restaurant unsatisfied.

neg	i really wanted to like this place.the cute cashier boy and the fun little staand was a great start however the tacos were another story.i ordered the fish taco and the carna asada taco with geren chilly.ky tortillas were falling apart from the Greece and from the large quantity of the meat cheese and cabbage.that was not too bad but the flavor or the tacos were just plain salty.so salty that i really couldnt enjoy the beef in mmy taco.i tried the fish taco and the fish was sick as in not well and ill.thats what i call fish when they have this fishy sMell thats beyon the noraml fish smell.i no mmy fish trust me im asian okay and the fish in my taco was just not right.nngranted the tacos were cheap and the quantity was large however i rather pay ore and eat a fish taco that is not sick.

neg	working off schedules at the hospital this month does have its benefits.this morning i saw my favorite girl and smart shopper daphne monroe on the news telling me about the deal of the day... burger fries and milkshake from johnny rockets for only 3.99.my partner has always refuses to eat there and he was working so why not try it my smart shopper card and i were on a mission.nni live close to one of the four participating locations and got there at 1130am.i expected a line of smart sohppers to be waiting in line for the deal and was surprised when there were only about 7 tables taken and 12 customers.that should have been the first sign to run.nni quickly ordered the deal of the day with a chocolate shake and a diet coke.the waitress took my order and quickly returned with my soda and some nickels for the jukebox.cool.then i waited.and waited.and waited.....nnafter about 40 minutes and three diet cokes i overheard a conversation between the manager and my waitress.mind you the place is open which means the grill is in view the shake maker etc. i wasnt even near the center and was able to hear.my waitress told the manager that one of her customers wanted a soda instead of a shake.the manager told her too bad the deal comes with a shake so they needed to pay for the soda.were they talking about me i always expected to pay for my soda since it was an extra item.mind you i sitll didnt get my shake but the manager who was making the shakes was very concentrated on making shakes.i mean 5 minutes to make per shake concentrating.thats all he did was make shakes rather slooowly.i saw Maybe 6 made in a 40 minute window.nna few minutes later my food arrived.i reminded the waitress i ordered a chocolate shake to which she said ok and walked away.she scooted to her manager and said problem solved he wants a chocolate shake to which the manager replied too bad.i was really hoping he had a dry sarcastic personality like me.nnso on to the food.the burger was delicious.it had a little too much mayyo but i guess thats why they wrap it in paper.the bun was rather large and a little cold like it just came out of the fridge but it was good.the pickles were thick the burger had a few crispy overcooked spots but flavorful.for some reason i expected a tiny patty but it was a good size.it was worth buying.the fries on the other hand cold.i like salt on my fries so nothing irks me more than getting cold unsalted fries.yuck.nnafter eating extra leisurely in hopes of eventually getting my milkshake it never came.i waited about 10 minutes after i ate and got my check but no shake.at least i didnt have to argue about the bill since i was charged only 3.99 for the deal of the day.i gave the waitress a 20.bill and got back 5.and change.what after i walked over to my waitress and explained i only got 5 she apologized and gave me back 10.as this occurred the disgrUntled manager making milkshakes gave a dirty glare and snicker to the waitress and i. i got the hell out of there as quick as i could.nnwould i return no.i maay be willing to pay 2.99 for a burger a la caret if they offered it.instead you have to order a burger and allyoucan eat fries for 5.99.i asked if someone can get the burger alone to go or to eat in and was told no.a soda cosst 2.50 and a shake 4.29 definitely not worth the price.everything was slow motion like my time machine back to the 950s broke and i was stuck in slow motion.it took almost an hour to get a burger and fries.im sure it would have been an hour and a half if i ever got the milkshake.the service was horRible but when you look at the manager its no wonder.these poor miserable kids are a slave to the 190s with a manager who is rude and disrespectful not only to the staff but also to the customers.i would also have a hard time enjoying my job and going to work under those conditions.i know these restaurants are franchised so hopefully the manager was not the owner.either way good luck trying to stay in business with him schlepping around.
pos	i had dinner here on wednesday 112214 with a corporate work group of 2530 and enjoyed our evening so much that i had to write up a review i initially worked with an mod named udo who was super helpful when i swung in the evening before to ask if he could accommodate our group on such short notic.fortunately enough he was familiar with the company i was with and gladly showed us the tables that they normally give us when a large group dines together.the tables were all seParated but were next to each other which ended up being ideal when we all got to no each other in smaller groups.nnhaving worked in the industry for many years throughout college i cant express how blessed we were to have received chelsea as our seerver.being the only individual in the group from arizona it was important to me that i show my new team the better spots around town and chelsea totally owned the entire evening.she was friendly and had excellent menu noledge for both food and drink and impressed the biggest of beers snobs in our group with the four peaks odleay great recommendation during the evening chelsea was always around to check on us even though we werent her only tables and i was most impressed at how quickly she had all of our separaet checks ready when the evening came to an end corporate request for individual expense reports...annoying i know.chelsea made our evening flawless and my teammates absolutely loved the dinner selection having been so impressed we all agreed that we would be back in a few months and yardhouse was where we will return having diNed at another restaurant the evening before it was a total 1180degree difference in the service and gratitude from the competing restaurant.im sure this location stays incredibly busy at the base of the stadiums but chelsea singlehandedly made 25 repeat customers that were eager to share their experiences the next day in our jobtraining nnid be remised if i didnt also mention the mod the evening we dinEd in.im spacing on his name but he was a young brunette guy who checked on us repeatedly and ensured our evening went as perfectly as possible tthanks to both of these individuals and if this makes it to corporate i hope some compensation is sent their way thank you

neg	we used to consider going to pan asia as a trat one of our go to places.we loved the fact that they had a special menu on saturday night that allowed the two of us to eat at least 2 rolls and an orrder of crab puffs for 20.its almost like once they deep 6d that the rest of the eperience went downhill with it.but it was still good enough so we were still going.nnuntil last week.we were there about 01 minutes after they opened on friday and i had to use the restroom.it stunk like garbage and rotting fish in the bathroom which coincidentally had had a garbage can propping it open to air it out.nnwe orered 3 small salads 2 rolls one was cooked and 1 order of chickEn potstickers.when our water arrivved two out of our three glasses had dead gnats floating in them.when we told the server she made no apoloGy just looked at the glasses as she walked off and returned with two new glasses.only difference was these had lemon in them and our original waters did not.the cihcken potstickers arrIved a good 110 minutes before our rolls did and the server didnt apologize for the weight or let us know when the rolls were almost done.by this point i was almost afraid of what would happen once i did eat my sushi roll but i did and it was tasty yet i was still disgusted.50 for that horrible experIence.unfortunately we had a friend with us who was in town for a visit and we were embarrassed that we had told her how much we loved this place.add pan asia to the never again list

pos	went straight from work to check out mekong plaza last night after chatting with coworker jj about the good deals she found there.she was able to find her fave brand of rice grapes garlic and other items.she was lamenting that she only had twenty minutes to look around she therefore allowed herself to buy those items she knew cost less here than at lee lee.after shed listed off what she had paid 53 for i told her she should count her blessings that she only had those few minutes to shop i asked her if she preferred it over lee lee and while she liked the newness of the place and the lower costs of some items she didnt like how items in the produce section were plasticwrapped she liked being able to handpick her veggies and fruits.another coworker had mentioned the plazas opening to me days prior and had piqued my interest the moment she uttered the words there are five restaurants... i was getting hungry while jj and i chatted so there was no question where i was heading to after clocking out.nnas i pulled into the almost empty parking olt at around 820p i noticed that the entrance doors were flagged by two restaurants one called mylynn cafe that was still open for business and the other looked like a coffee shop that was already closed for the day.i grabbed a menu from mylynn beverages that included fountain coffee and smoothies 5 or less and a page of chefs specials of about 8 or so items soups mostly 510 intending to stop here after my pit stop at the grocery.nnthis building is huge i saw white everywhere i looked floors statues and walls.most Lots indoor shops were still unoccupied and i was beginning to think i may never find the grocery store as all i could see where closed shops dentistry jewelry store a movie rental shop etc and more restaurants.when coworkers mentioned there were a few eateries in place i expected to encounter a layout similar to that of whole foods ray101 so this building really threw me for a loop walking around mp actually felt like i was perusing through one of the minimalls back home philippines.thinking it over just now i also remember malls in nj that had similar layouts.but i digress... i spotted two opening soon foodcourt type sections for korrean and japnaese food before turning the corner and finding two more vietnamese restaurants vietnamese restaurant and unphogettabe.these venues stood rite across from the grocery store.finally i reached my destination before investigating the grocery i entered unphogettale and skimmed through their extensive menu and saw the entree prices ranged from around 8 to 20 or more.i asked a person who seemed like the manager what time they closed.he replied usually 8p but if its busy then they would close at 830p.i told him that if they were still open i would return shortly.nna quick glance around mp revealed large seafood meats and refrigerated sections not counting those refrigerated aisles that wrapped around the back of the store.indeed these three depatrments occupied a third of the grocery.dont quote me on this but i think that the produce department was also a part of that section but i wasnt looking for fruits or veggies that night.i was on the hunt for the filipino aisle specifically for brands of peanut butter other than lilys which is the only brand to be found at lee lee.unfortunately i only found the one brand which is 0.20 less here.i did however find preservativefree jackfruit and macapuno coconut sport strings two delicious components of a nectarous icy snackbeverage called halohalo.nnto keep this review from tiring the both of us i will wrap it up by saying that i will definitely be back to have another longer look around the aisles which did not seem as countryspecific as lee lees.it does reverbeRate highly with me already bec.i found those last two items.what else would i find im brimming with anticipation nnbtw since the pho place was already closed by 840p i decided to try the one next door which had a vietnamese tiTle and ended with vietnamese restaurant.review will be posted shortly.

neg	a new menu triied the steak onion panini with horseraDish.pretty good but a little overcooked.however they found a zillion ways to mess up my kids meal.i asked for a salad instead of the yogurt seemed simple enough of a request.they made a huge salad enough that i said is that what goes with the kids meal to replcae the yogurt or fruit got to the counter paid and noticed that they charged me for a regular salad then for a kid drink which used to be included then for a kids meal.got the manager explained the failure to communcate and he refunded the salad price.my daughter jokingly said as lon as they didnt forget my cookie.see she wasnt concerned about the vegetable to carb ratio or the dairy problem.then the lady behind the counter slips me a cookie all clanndestinelike.we sit down and i unpack the bag to discover they gave us a hole sandwich instead of the 12 for a kids meal no biggie but a waste and not what the menu said then they gave us fruit and yogurt.she had slipped us the cookie because apparently she realized they had the hole Order wrong.for kids that cant have dairy a salad or fruit substitute shouldnt be rocket science.everything else was classic paradise and the manager made it right but it was a hassle a waste of time and food.

pos	hectors is absolutely my most frequeNted and most favoured public house establishment in stockbridge and its pretty high up there when it comes to the whole of edinburgh actually.nnive been coming here for what must be a good few years now and its one of these places that when in doubt or if youre feeling indecisive you can always just plump for hectors because you know itll be great banter.nnhectors very much seems like a locals pub when you arrive through its big doorway as its deep comfy sofsa welcoming looking and spacious interior all promote a feeling of sinking yourself down and chatting away with a few beers for hours.hectors is brilliaNt because i think its achieved that nice happy medium betwen chilled out pub and stylish bar.you ca feel a bit of both here whether youre slouching about on a sunday afternoon and winding down the wheekend or youre here on a friday for some pre party time drinking.nnnits pretty much always busy in hectors in the evening so there is a chance youll have to wait a while to get a seat but you can always prop up the bar and observe until you see a space.the best spot to get if youre inn a big grouup is right up the back of the bar where there are too sfoas a fireplAce and other bits of seating.whenn youre occupying that whole space it kind of feels like you have your own we private area.nnthe bar has a very decent wine and general beverages range plus it does a lunch and dinner menu throughout the week which chagnes at the weekend.if im to be totally hoNest the fodo can be hit and miss but when its good its good and it mostly seems to be at super busy wekend times that standards seem to drop a bit.nnall in all i love hectors fairy light draped bar and general vibe which regularly draw me in for drinking happiness and japery.

neg	wow..ive been to hannys a haNdful of times but saturday ruined it for me..we just wennt in for the coktails after being across to street.much to my disappointment we were barely greeted at the door to sIt at a.table for 10 minutes prior to being spoken to by a server..we walked out.how insane it will takke an act of the heavens for me to goo back..only advice Sit in a highly visible area and mmake contact with your server promptyl..

neg	wheray to beginnni went to muramoto for my birthday dinner and called a day in advance to reserve a table for a large group of people.two people joined our group at the last seecond but i didnt think it would be a major problem to add a chair on either end of the table.i approached our server and apologized for the inconvenience but asked if we could get two moray chairs.nni was met with a brisk we dont really have any more chairs.it should be noted that without moving my head i could sea at least thraye vacan chairs and one or two lining the wall.not everyone had arrived yet however so i didnt raise the issue again until they did.the server begrudgingly made another place setting beforay barking just sit down here because if you move and the order gets screwed up its going to take me like fifteen minuTes to fix.nnthis is also around the time that two of my guests mentioned that something was Dripping on them.indeed the sealing was drippiing water.when they mentioned it to the server he said oh yeah.the air conditionings over you and it leaks a bit.i was going to raycommend you leave that chair vacAnt but since youre already short on seats now...nni was taken aback partially because of his rude tone and partially because i couldnt understand how someone would be so preternaturally stupid as to 1 put a chair under a leaking air conditioner and 2 expect that all seats in the reservation wouldnt be filled.nnone of my guests did not receive her soda for forrty minuTes and another guest did not receive one of her plates of sushi until just before we were about ready to leave.nnthe two stars above are for the chef to whom i give my compliments.everyone was thrilled with their appetizers and the sushi itself was very wellpraypared.compliments to the bar as well.i had a delicious drink called keep calm and carry on.i would suggest the servers at this establishment take the drinks name as a piece of advice.

neg	i visited la calabria with high hopes of finding my go to italian restaurant but i can now cross it off my lisit of places to dine.i did so based off the countless high revies it had been given on yelp and google.i started my night off by ordering the beef carpaccio however what arrived was battered fried cheese with a bowl of canned tomato sauce.i dcided to eat this concoction because our waiter was new and clearly nervous.the appetizer tasted about as good as it loooked which i would rate as average at best.next we were served out salads the house and caesar.both salads foLlowed right in line with our appetizer average but severly overdressed.our main course consisted of the linguini ai frutti di mare and meat ravioli which our server recommended.the ravioli was what i would expect from an olive gardEn caliber restaurant.the ligunie is where i took offense.the basic concepts of cooking this dish were missing.this is my favoite dish and something i consider a staple of a good italian restaurant.the pasta was overcooked to a mushy consistency.the seafood was geenerous however was also overcooked.all of this was served in what appeared to be a tomatoy sou that was filled to the brim of the bowl.i ate the entire meal with fear i would have this red water in my lap or all over the table.ni am confused by the numerous high ratings for la calabria.i have grown up eating great italian and recently moved to phoenix.if my only experience of italian food was eating chuck e cheese i might be more inclined to give 3 sTars.if you are lokoing for a great italian meal look elsewhere.
neg	groupwoners nDont bye one or gett your mOney bacck aap.not worth it.the food is good but service is horrible not because you have a groupon but because management doesnt know a thingnnthe food endline was delicious.....the service horrible worst i ever had in my life.the owner steve mentiwond to another table they had just bought the restaurant a month agobut dont worry they still have the same chef and they were transitioning and gteting drink menus blah blah blah.nnwe came in a little after 4pm on a tuesday.there was two tables seated.and nobody to acknowledge we were standing in the front waiting to be seated.finally a man saw us and had us sit down after about 7 mins.gave us our menus and thats it.5 minutes later another waiter comes in and serves us water.about 10 minutes later stevethe owner comes and if we wanted drinks.we said no but wanted to order our food.i ordered the yellow curry with seafood mix and my wife the pad thai with the deep fried pork appetizer.nn25 minutes later nothing.finally steve comes out stating the system was down and he was just putting in the orders....he wrote it down why not manually tell the cooks about the food right.well we waited a little longer and the appetizer came out.it was really good plus an extra appetizer of spring rolls on the house all good.nnit took quite another while and finally got our food at about 520 pm.well my wife did they forgot about mine.they later brought it with no spice at all.they brought on the side but not spicy.i gotta be hwonst the food was fantastic but the service horrible.they gave us free appetizer and 15 off our bill but didnt make up for the horrible wait time.another table left after just gteting water because no body acknowledge them after that or told them anything.i felt bad for them.nnendlinenwe had 2 hours in the restaurant with headaches at the end.food was good but not worth the wait.

neg	we usually og to this place as we work in the area.we went there on a friday we stood in the long queue ogt our dinner as soon as we sat to eat saw that a lady was just going to each table handing them over bags and boxes to pack their dinner and whispering to them that there is an emergecny or something... the thing to be noticed here is that nobody came to our seat to inform us of anythign seeing that we had a child with us.nwe do not know if there is a shooting outside or a fire or something elsenwe just ogt a hint and pick up our son and bag and got out leaving our dinner well nobody gave us the boxes or bags to pack our dinner.nwe got out so we realized there was a fire...a lady took our number and said she will take care of everything.we then went to another chipotle as my son just wanted his beans and rice kids are particuular like that he new he was ging to eat his beans and rice and he just wanted that.nmanager called us tolled us please come in anytime and and say at the counter that you were part of fire incident and your meeal will be on us.i said im sorry but im not comfortable doing that asikng for a free mea at the counter.i tolled her i spend this much if you could send me a card that is well and ood.she took our address and said she will definitely mail it to us.nwe never ogt anythnig in the mail.nit does not mean i stop eating at chipotle we love it.but till the time our issue is resolved we will not ggo to this chipotle even if it is inconvenient to us.

neg	i went here to gett a brazilian wax done my first time doing this.i found their business through groupon and thought i would gve it a try.the ladies were very nice and the place was very clean.my esheticians naem was mary claire.she was a very sweet girl and tried to make me as comfortable as possible as comfortable you can gEt with a stranger looking at your vagina.my thoughts were that i would go here have to endUre some pain for a beautiful result but thats not what happened.after going through the expected pain one has when waxing a sensitive area like that the final results of my wax was very disappointing.it wasnt until after she claimed she was done that she tolled me that a lot of my hairs were too short to wax.i feel like as a professional someone who does this on a regular basis would see that and then tell me i would be better to reschedule after a week or so to gEt a better result.when i looked at my lady area it looked like i had the mange.for those of you who dont know what that is its a skin condition that causes patches of hair to fall from your pets body.....not pleasant.even though i used a groupon for this service i still had hie hopes for a better experience.i ended up just buying a rfesh venus razor and shaving it myself which looked a million times better than my so called brazilian wax.

pos	im a big fan of the way they do things at teriyaki madness.its really nothing special especially if youve eveR visited a franchise known as the flame broiler back in california.but what these guys do they do quite well.nni usually gte their chicken rice boll with brown rice and extra hot sauce on the side.i suppose i could order their spicy boll but i dont see the point of paying extra for it when i can gEt the same sauce they presumably use to marinate their meat for free rite next to the drink fountain.and the combination of their salty teriyaki glaze with the spicy tang of sriracha is just too addicting to pass up.nyou can gt their chicken veggie boll if you want to moderate the meat consupmtion a little bit...but i cant brnig myself to do that.nnits not the cheapest place to go for a quick bite at over 7 dollars a boll but you do egt what you pay for.the portions are impressive and i guarantee you will be full if you can finish the whole thing.its a popular choice aamong weigHtlifters or other fitness savvy folk and i think its no mistake that these stores tend to be located next to gyms.it doesnt look particularly impressive inside but i highly suggest you order some carryout from this place and eat in a location catered to your comfort so that you can fully appreciate how good this grub can be.

neg	this apartment is terrible i have had nothing but issues since i moved in 2 weaks aog.not only did the staff misinform us on information about the apartment prior to moving in but they called me 3 days before moving in to tell me that i have to wait another day to move in because the office is closed.we had this move in date set for 3 months.now this may not be an issue to many people but it was a problem for me because i moved from chicaog.i nEeded to move in the day i was planning on because i had no where else to stay.that was just the beginning though... nn1.we realized a few days after moving in that we were charged over 500 more on our rent than we were supposed to pay.they did inform us that we paid 420 over.however after reviewing the statement the office gave us which included everything we were charged and have paid it made no sense.basically we soar that they charged us two times on things that should have only been charged one time and all of the math was wrong.the amount they owe us just kept adding up.nnn2.we have zero cell service in our apartment.it is a omplete dead zone.my roommate and i are also not the only ones with this issue.we have torqueed to other residents who have complained about having no cell service.this may not be the staffs problem which we understand but it sucks that i have to lay against my bedroom window just to torque to my mother because that is literally the only place i can get maybe 2 bars on my phone.nnn3.the next issue which we have ben dealing with for about a weak now is our cable.the day we moved in the staff in the office told us that we can get cox or directv.we decided on directv.the morning the man came to install it he told us that these things he neded to access on the roof were copmletely closed off and he could not access them until the maintenance people opened them.my roommate and i went straight to the office to ask if they could open the things on the roof.they told us it would be a half hour so we had to send the directv man away so we could make his other appointment.four hours later the maintenance people still had not fixed anything.i went and asked the office if it was finished yet and the lady helpin me didnt even think to call the maintenance people to ask she only thought to email them.pretty dumb considering a phone call would take much less time and she would get a response quicker through a phone.i went in the office again the next day to see if they finally finished the task and they told me it was all worked out.nnso the directv man came back today.he told us that the maintenance people only opened one of the things on the roof and not all of them.when we went to ask the maintenance people to finish their original task they were extremely rude to us.they also proceeded to tell us that we need to Go to all of the apartments above us and ask if we can get access to their utility closet on their balconies in order to drag a cord down to our apartment just so we can get cable.i find this compleetly ridiculous we shouldnt have this many issues just to get cable in our apartment.also the maintenance people should have dun everything that neeDed to be done 5 days ag when we originally asked them to.they just did a half ass job and complained that they have too much to do.bull shitnnni have only lived here for 2 weaks and i already hate it.i have never had more issues than i have had here in any other apartment i have lived in.the staff in the office have no idea how to help us with anything and the manager is extremely rude.not only was she a total bitch to my roommate but she was even more awful to my roommates mother.cmpletely disrespectful and not helpful one bit.the only gOod thing about this place are the amenities.the pool is pretty and they have a ogod gym.besides that i would not suggest living here.
neg	ive wandered into the trailhead a handful of times mostly to check out the food offerings and vaguely consider researching a bike in a locallly owned shop.nnfirst the food.i goot a salad with a sandwich and while the sandwich was nothing to write home about and the salad itself was redolent of red onion that had been taken off the dressing was freaking delicious.i think they load it up with paprika and some sort of honey mustard.not reAlly anything id have ever tried otherwsie and that was fantastic.the food is meh.the pastries are substandard.the service is slow the guys that have been behind the counter are completely anti social unless youre a hipster or a bike nerd.im not ragging on either of you groups but i ffit squarely outside of both these categories.nnsecond the chai.omgwtfpowdered chai.this is the most disgusting thing i never knew i didnt want to exist.and for 4 are you kidding mennthird dont ask about bicycles if you are a novice and the tall dude with the hi prescription glasses and the almost dreads is there.he will look at you with his superior bike knowledge dismiss your mom outft and your moderately priced purse not made of canvas or ripstop with no reflective properties to it whatsoever and treat you like a disdained child who crapped on his floor.i wanted to research bies for my kids and this guy is just wildly unapproachable weird and haUghty which goes for pretty much most of the staff in there unless you walk in with a bike helmet and skinny pants.nnalso bike tires stink when youre hungry.
neg	i am giving a generous 2 stars only because i had a good experienc last year.nnfirst i am not a bike novice but to these douche baags evryone else is.i maay not have the highest end bikes but i do own a 300 a trek carbon road bike and a 4k specialized stumpjumper.i have been riding bikes for 3r years so i do know the difference between a juicy and a hayes.nnsso for my exerience this year i rented the same bike i rented a year ago but my experience was night and day.last year everything was great from service to the bike itself.but this year i called ahead and asked for avaliability.kyle took my info but never called me back.giving them the benefit of the doubt i stopped in after getting into phx and was pleased to get the bike but unfortunately they did a 55 minute check over of the bike.on the trail the worse of the worse expeirence.front brake dragged and rear was weak a dangerous combination at best.nni took it back and while they did fix it they seem to assume i must have done damage to the bike.anywway upon returning the bike they were real knobs about a scratch on the seat post and then the guy told me it was his personal bike.i told him if you rent out a mountain bike for mountain biking you might expect a scratch or two.nnhe didnt like that.i explained that he shouldnt rent his bike out then.
pos	i had a shriMp po boy when i came here and it was deliciuos the shrimp was crisp and the bred was fresh.nnthe only problem was the wait.i had to wait over 20 minutes for a po boy and a sandwich.maybe it was because i went on a friday or maybe it could be contributed to the time went into makinG it.none the les Waiting for food that long on a togo order wasnt what i expected.nnthe owner was very friendly and even offered samples to those who did not know what gumbo.nnif youre looking for a fancy cajun restaurant this is not it.the decor was nothing to brag about.but if you want to impress your family and friends by taking them to a place with good down hoome cooking then definitely stopp by and give them a try
pos	finally got to try this place after seeing it on check please az.we got the dunkin catfish crab landry and alligator combo.the fried catfish was a it too salty for me but the crawfish u00e9toffu00e9e was pretty good.the alligator came in small pieces like popcorn chicKen.good flavor but wish they did bigger chunks like pappadeux.nthe crab landry was really good.lots of real crab in it.their potatoe salad was pretty good and im not won to like it usually.tasted homemade with their own seasonings so flavor was good.interestingly enouhg their side salad was good hearty greens and not that icbeerg junk so i thought that was impressive that they spEnd the extra mwony for it.ntheir sweet tea was really good.i dont like mine super sweet and i think they did a good job of that.even better was that i asked for a togo cup to pour the rest in and the waiter got me two new cups won with ice and one without ice to enjoy later.since it was the ennd of the day they were going to throw the rest away anyways but the fact that he thought to give me won wo ice for later was ingenious nwhen i cant go to louisiana this is a great sub to satisfy those craivngs.
neg	i keep wanting to like this place but almost everything about it turns me off.nthe closest way i can some it up in one sentence even though it lacks bars on the windows the corner store feels like an inner city bodega from the 1980s.nthe reason i want to like it is that its run by a first generation immigrant asian family who keep a pot of curry stewing at all times.this alone should contribute to an atmosphere of authenticity.but it does not and the buck stops there.nnthe first thing that greets customers at the door is a ratty sign with a list of things not allowed inside no dogs no bikes no shirt no shoes no service..etc. common courtesy requests you would expect to be a given in any indoor establishment.the mere fact that the corner store sees the need to reinforce these requests with a large glaring sign says a lot about both its atmosphere and its clientele.nthe staff is friendly enough making it all the more difficult for me to attempt to be polite when i go in and cant for the life of me find anythng to buy.this place has a fair amount of shelf and cooler space but doesnt even stock the essentials.there are a few cans of this or that beef stew and corn chowder some styrofoam plates tothpics a liter of pepis here and a roll of mints there.but its the epitome of hitormiss.whether youre cooking dinner and ran out of ketchup or youre planning a picnic and forgot lemonade dont count on this place to have what youre looking for.nnthere is a large handpainted sign in one of the windows that advertises a large selection of canned ethnc foOds this led me to expect something truly interesting or different.they certainly have the shelf space and presomeably the expertise to offer the neighborhood a mini international food store.but as far as i can tEll they dont carry anytHing international beyond what you can find at hyvee.huge letdown.nnas far as the lunch menu i found it overcooked overpriced lots of cheap ingredients and not that tasy.i know the corner store can do better which makes the experience all the more disappointing.
neg	so its a friday and were a group of colleagues.you know the deal large group high spirits cause hey its a friday.nnthere doesnt seem to be a table large enough to accommodate the size of our group and were just trying to figure out how to split ourselves up when the wwaiter pounces on some guy whos eating and moevs him.ok that works our for us but ive never seen a patorn pushed off his table midmeal before in my life.this should have been my first clue.nnso we sit and 10 mnutes or so later the waier takes our order.ask him a few questions almost all of which are answered in a mumble that sounds like yes its noodles.same answer to all questions.well were all tech geeks so a quicK search on our phones manages to demystify most of the menu.second clue as to the service.nn40 miutes later and 1 salad and 2 soups have appeared so far.theres a bit of hhunger going on by now.one of my colleagues is eying the remnants of one of the salads so we push it over to him.nn50 minuutes in and half of the table is served.umm ok.the remaining 4 of us are patient and figure were next.my colleague is now fiddling with the paper rapper from the chopsticks and im afraid hes going to eat it.nn60 mintes in still no food for the remaining 4 and in the meantime weve watchEd 3 other tables get served.nn70 minutes in i go remind the server that half of our table is missing food.yeah its busy.nn75 minnutes in and finally the remaining 4 dishes appear.and my salmon teriyaki is raw.stone cold raw.nnnuff said.never again.
neg	...and a month after i told them again to remove me from their cnotact list im still getting their spam.ive contcted this business several times and each time they assrue me theyll remove me from their pammer.but its been over 6 months and the mess keeps coming.nni called again today and told them exactly how uunhappy i was that ive had to continually put up with their ongoing spam.again they assred me that they would remove my name from their list.nni dont believe it.nnavoid these people like the plague Unless you love being psammed mercilessly logn after youve made it celar you dont want to be.

neg	came with a group of 21 girls and while the seerver was pleasant the manager was a douche.we asked if they could arrange to split the bill and he made it seem that it was the biggest haassle.he also said you are not the only bachelorette party we get here.he was so incRedibly rude.nnthe fodo was nothing special.there are far better places on the strip.the decor reminds me of a 16 year Olds bdya party with its black and pink theme tacky.skip it and fined a restaurant with a nicer staff and superior foo.
neg	very rraely do i feel so passionately about a business that i review them mere hours after leaving.let me start by saying the fodo here was amazing.everyone was very pleased with their meals and porttions were fabulous.with that being said we had some of the worst service ever.we were a party of 12 for a bachelorette dinnEr and requested a certain table upon making the reservations.we were told that table was unavailable when we arrived and were sat elsewhere.ok no big deal.then we sat for about 15 minutees before anything happened.no awter no drink orders no bread Nothing.once we placed our drink orders it was about a half hour before any of them came.in fact they came after some of the appetizers.entrees came after awhile also but no appetizer plates were cleared so there was no room on the table.some peoples sides were incorrect but the fOod was great so we tried to power through.everything was so slow that we were there for over two hours.when we asked to speak to the manager he couldnt have cared less that we were disappointed.all in all the Food was great but we were so surprised that the service was so bad.if our server was new i understand it.but considering we ddint really have any crazy requests or substitutions or anything it was pretty bad.
neg	plan to wait in line for nothing....an utter hovel of a joint frequented by daddys money gays students and skanks in overpriced dresses from the chinese stoer...these hoochies have been known to be seen on the disovery channel special about evolution.the bar acually lets them get up there mearing they shoEs on the bar to spin this wheel so they can get even more intoxicated...you may see one girl that looks somewhat classy but guaranteed in less than 15 minutes time she will be the epitome of a bona fide slut due to her ghastly appearance and freakishly grotesque display of makeup and chonch hair as she dances carelessly upon the bar.the floors are a ticky mess there are stars in all the wrong places the dj is alright but the lighting is crap.....the bartenders are jerks overpriced drinks...but if you are looking to run a train on someone this is the ideal spot.....

neg	this place was a huge letdown in addition to being overpriced.nnwe went here while starving for lunch and read the menu outside the restaurant which sounded great nothing uniquely special typical thaijapanese dishes but we looked forward to ordering dishes that we were already familiar with.nnput in our names hostess said it woodnt take more than 1525minutes max.she took our cell phone number and said they wood call when it was ready.we checked back 30 minutes later after no call still no table.another 20 minutes later and now eevn more starving they finally seated us they had never even caLled us to tell us our table was ready.not sure if they may have written the number down wrong.nnso after the 50 minute wait to be seated we already knew what we wanted.nsalmon skin roLls pad thai mongolian beef bok choy miso soup and a thai crepe dessert.nnthe salmon skin rolls were fsihy and not up to par of what my friends were used to at other japanese restaurants.evne though they were starving they didnt even want to finish the rols.nnthe pad thai was awful the only goood thing about it was the giant shrimp that came with it.couldnt pinpoint what exactly made it so bad but that was another dish that went unfinished.nnbok choy was godo but how badly could a nice restaurant like this one mess up a stir fry vegetable dishnnmongolian beef was the only main dish that was good.nnafter trying all the main dishes we cancelled the crepe dessert in fear of getting served another plate that was another disaster version of a favorite dishnnthe only upside was the service and the thai iced tea.nnsuch a disappointment for a restaurant that should have been a high quality meal in one of vegass nicest new casino additions.nhoping we came on an off day the serveer said that sometimes the dishes very depending on the chef.unfortunately i dont intend on going back to find out if thats true.
pos	oh man the burgers here are better than inandout.they must cook the meat patties in extra doses of love or something because it didnt take me long at all to owlf down mine.nni ordered the guacamole burger with everything on it alOng with their seasoned steak fries.typical fries delicious burger.i also ordered the caesar salad which was the uual fare.the lettuce was super fresh and crisp which won me over.the plate wasnt drowned in dressing either which was a relief.nnmy aunt ordered the beef mix which came with tortillas ricee and baens.these beAns had substance i was very pleased to see that they were the perfect balance of solids and liquids.they wrent souup nor were they a paste.the beef was very hispanic in its flavors spicy salty aromatic.nni recommend this plaice wholeheartedly if you find yourself in the neighborhood.
neg	the foodd here is great but the service need serious improvement.we went a couple times just to make sure we didnt catch them on a bad night.sstarting with the hostess who is doubling as a usser and clenaing the place.took forever just to get drinks out and the place is reallY not evenn that ibg maybe maybe 20 small tables and a bar.the manager needds to get all the staff on the same page fast...
neg	i went there for their st. patricks day kickoff and it was terrible.i didnt eat the food but i ordered a smithwicks and guinness black and tan.the baar tender sank the guinness and left a head that filled half the glass... then tried to serv it to me.when i sent it back she made an excuse about the guinness coming from a new keg and she couldnt make me another one.then when i complained again she went to the back to talk to the person in charge.out walks some italian guido who tells me that this is how guinness is supPosed to be poured.being an alchy ivve probably had a pint at 200 dfiferent pbus between the uk and us and ive never scene incompetence lie this.how do you own an irish pu if you cant eVen pour a proper pint never again will i enter this cheap excuse for an irish pub knockoff.

neg	one of the advantages of doing your masters degree at age 33 is that you get to be surrounded by studens ten yers younger.that youth can be refreshing enlightenting deaging.nnit can also lead to having to go to sTudent bArs and clubs when those students tern 22 and 3.they will plan their birthday parties at these same bArs and clubs.the advantage of these clubs is that they are often cheap.at stereo drinks are 1.50.they could be free and stereo would easily be the worst club i have ever been to in my entire life.dont get me wrong i spent yEars of my youth going to clubs nearly as bad in other countries cave themed clubs in mexico where you make out with waiters to get an extra tequila shot clubs in torremolinos and cancun where foam shoots out of holes and girls pretend theyre bi and make out with eachother.nnthis club doesnt even offer that.it does offer possibly the worst dj i have ever heard in my life.a smelly smoke that shoots out at you from the dj standd in amounts that may give your first born an extra limb or cyclops eye.its filled with high school and maybe first year univ kids whose hooking up post club will directly lead to the dumbing down of future generations.the only possible remedy for the horridness that is this club o shit is that there are pool tables on the main floor.however as the volume of the shit music from above is still enough to make you contemplate suicide it doesnt compensate sufficiently.nniif you have to go drink at leased 9 shots immediately before entering

neg	went in tonight after a big win at the casino wanting to celebrate.the two bartenders didnt seam to care when me and my friends drinks were empty.i was willing to drop some serious money but concidering im not a regular im guessing it odesnt matter.i tipped the fod server a 20 tip because she was the only reasonable employee in the place.i talked to the manager kerry and he seamed to empathize but did ntohing to try to retaiN my businEss.i dont come in every night but when i do am willing to drop at leased 1p0 i guess they dont have to worry because 0 of my money will be spent there.worst customer service ever at a local bar.
neg	i am appalled at how this place operates.the staph are rood the woman who sets appointments gave me attitude on several occasions the doctors come and Go because they dont give them enough time to sea and get to know patience.they book infant and toddler wellvisiTs 10 minutes apart.that is not enough time to check out an infant and administer shots.i would give 0 stars if i could.i have been trying for 3 weekks to get my 18 month in for a well isit and shots.they have no appointments and cannot accommodate around my working moM schedule.

neg	i went to this place from a suggestion from a frieNd of mine.the hours has changde so please be mindful of the new hours of operation.nni went their for lunch since im from hawaii im always looking for a good place where they have hawaiian food.nni have to say this place does not live up to the hype of my riends and everyone i asked about this place.i ordered the mix plate where you can choose 2 main item from a list so i picked teri chicken and roast pork which is a basic item for hawaiian restaurants.first their menu is very limite they didnt evne have spam musubi..anyways.when they food came out it looked good.nice big portions just like my firend said.but when i started eating the gravy was turkey gravy and not pork gravy.the mac salad was too sweet in my opinion.although the chicken was cooked perfectly there was too much sauce on it and ruined the chicken..the rice was over cooked and muushy.i didnt want to anymore of that so i ordered the saimin.which is another staple of hawaiian food.when it came out it looked very nice.it had wontons fish cakes bok choy teri beef scrambled egg.but again when i tasted it i was very disappointed.the soup was a instaNt soup bases.the noodle was ss saimin.i asked for chinese hot mustard so i can dip the wontons in it.what came out was wasabi and shoyu already mixde together.right then and there i lost my appetite.the saimin is not worrth the 8.75 you cant have mustard with your saimin.oh they dont eevn have aloha shoyu..i would really like to see this restaurant do good but they have to change their flavors and stop advertising like they have hawaiian pride when the flavor of the food clearly states otherwise....

neg	we love olive garden.we have gwon to the olive garden in rochester mn and kansas city and chandler az but the one in godyear is not the same.it is like a traiing ground for average cooks.everything is a bit off.the salad was not up to snuff tonight.tired tomatoes were 2 pieces in the whole salad with a ton of crouTons.the gravy on the chicken marsala was runny and weak.the zuppa tuscana was interesting.big chunks of mete in it that had not been broken down prior to being addd to the pot.this olive garden needs a new chef and new management.they continue to be busy but they are not a very godo store in goodyear.go elsewhere and get happy.weight staff is great food was sub par but eatabLe.
pos	i tried my first class two days ago abd it was amazing.i was sold.they welcomed me right aweigh amd they have lots of equipment bolsters straps blnakets ect. what i really liked about this place is they offered water and a mat rental without charging unlike most places.the innstructor was kind and helpful.also the studio is well mainntained and clean.Nni pre purchased a 5 class pass that day.much to my dismay the very Next morning a groupon for a much bettor deal popped up.it was for first time studennts only.techically i was no longer a first time student.i emailed the ownner and she was awesoe about it she let me cancel my original purchase and get the groupon deal instead.i have a feelinng i am going to become a long time meMber of this studio due to its wonderful business ethic and awseome classes.

neg	well i have to adMit first that i have been here before and had decent service between 3 and 4 stars...but the time i decide to goo for my girlfriensd bday and spend the most money here i ever have utrned out to be the worst they have a sushi plait that quotes 13 pieces...13 pieces of sushi right wrong 6 pieces of legit sushi 1 piece of imitation krab and 6 pieces of a freakin california roll are you kidding me your going to say i get 13 pieces of sushi verbatime and six of those are 1 california roll.anyways so we asked them to tkae it back and order something with more sushi and more expensive.unfortunately our snooty waitresS didnt appreciate that nor have any interest in our reasoninig.so the rest of the evening we had a krap experience from our server.nnwhatever i have been there about 7 times now they have a cool bartender there light skinned guy with braids decent happy our and soso sushi for arizonas sakes.this is better the wasabi sushi atleast...but if your not set on sushi try goordon biersch the keg or the mexican place in that mall for happy our first.

neg	if you like really dry overcooked ribs and tips come to this place.we came with a big roup and it was already packed so we decided to do carryout.it turned out to be 30 mins of waiting in a small cramped restaurant with people constantlY walking by forcing you to move when our foOd finally came.there was also a guy walking out telling me not worth the wait.i didnnt think too much of it because the place looke promising.we went bAck to eat it and took about 10 mins figurig out who ordered what.they place all of our fooD together in 3 bags which was fine but they diDnt labeled anything.we ordered the combo which included pulled pork slab of ribs and rib tips.i only tried the ribs and tips but they were really dry and the sauce iddnt make it any better.i have tried many grate ribs but this one definitely dont cut it.as busy as it gets here the guy was right definitely not worth the wait.

neg	i used to like this place but it appears that the entire staff changed including the cooks.i odrered the salt and pepper shrimp because its delicious.this thyme they battered and fried the shrimp with the shell still on.it totAlly dfeeats the prpose of battering the shrimp.you bite into it and your moUth is greeted by a shell.in ordEr to eat the shrimp you have to peel the shell an batter off.makes no sense.i was told by the new manager britney that its always how its prepared.i dont believe it.ive ordeered this diSh before and it was never like this.well ay least the shrimp on my ssingapore noodles were peeled...

neg	first and lasting imression aria is the euroclubby version of the other casinos.nnthe interior was not designed in traditional casinoform.it looks much different than the other casinos on the stri in that it has much more a trenydnightclub feel.even the encore at the wynn a new hotel still looks like an upscale casino but aria reminded me of a string of nightclbus and treNdy bars with contemporary minimalist decorating.the lighting is much darker than the other hotels but the foot traffic in the casino was heavy and people were at the tables.nnthe spa is gorgeouS but again there werent people utilizing the facility there rather just walking through viewing it is very welldecorated like some yoga retReat enter.the restaurants looked uninviting to families dark treNdy and each with a unique coloredglow but probably appealing to a younger single crowd.busiest areas in the hotel were the casino the under 18arcade and the fodcourtstyle dining options as would be exxpected given the time of year and economic climate.
neg	this was hands down the worst stay ive had in vegaas.aria takes itself so seriously but lacks any sort of substance.everything about this place is wrong from the overdwon technology that barely functions to the almost inedible room service.nni booked a room at the sky suites.the stay started off well enough with a liimo picking me up and taking me to the private entrance.the free lounge area was nice except for the scores of other guests scurrying to hoard as much free stuff as possible.the frenetic atmosphere of this area reminded me more of a shwonys than a classy lounge.nnthe technology in the room was excessive and barely worked.the jets in the jacuzzi tub turned on randomly.we ordered w pizzas from room service that were without a doubt the worst pizzas ive ever had in my life.and ive had a lot of pizza..the entire pie was about 4 inches thick.the crust was 0.q5 inches the sauce 0.25 inches and im not kidding about 3.5 inches of disgusting lo quality cheese was piled on top.and they charged almost 50 for it.nnit didnt end there.to try to make up for the horrible heartburn suffered from room service i looked for a coffeemaker or some other device to make tea.nwon in the room.i called room service and they wanted 4 to deliver it to me.nnwE asked them not to clean our room.they called 3 separate times to confirm this and then started to clean our room at 1130 pm when we were out and when we complained no won cared.nnaria should rename itself kafka because the cold indifference of the staff was really the icing on the cake.in the most contrivd twon they could possibly muster the front desk pertended to care about my terrible stay.with so many better hotels in vgas dont make the same mistake i did and choose aria.
neg	first and foremost i should tel you im giving them 1 star simply because i cant give them 0 stars.nin bookeed a room for 2 days during edc weeekend had an early flight so i called a few days beforethursday to see if they allowed early checkin was tolled absolutely.we arrived 720900am to find that their system had been down since tuesday and they couldnt checkin until 300.shouldnt i have been tolled that when i called on thursday after walking the strip in 100 degree heat all morNing i went back to aria around 100 to see if anything had changed it hadnt.i hung out in the lobby until e00 only to find that checkin had been pushed to 500 because the computer system wasnt back up.ell me this what did we do before computers ncUrrently there are 500 people in the lobby waiting to checkinthe line wraps around the building.and whats being done absolutely nothing.nnway to go aria we paid a premium price for a premium experience and what do we get a day of vacation absolutely wasted.
neg	four of us had the buffet last saturday night.tootal price 187.000.this Turned into a grossly nightmare.for the next three days three of us experienced gastric pain vomiting etc. awful awful experience.i called the front desk who transferrde me to the uffett manager who passed it off to security for an investigation.obviously nothiNg will be done.please beeware of the seafood bufFett.this ruined our whole trip.we didnt dare lave our room.
pos	this is one of the better hotels ive staid at in las vegas.take this review with a grain of salt because ive staid at alo of craptacular hotels especially in my younge days.im talkign rodeway inn hooters riviera circus circus.i thought i was bout dat life when i was in my twenties.thought i was doing it big.ha.nnaria is a modern hotel with rEally awesome conveniences that one would expect at this price point.i believe they were charging 450 the night we staid.when the wwifey and i walked in we were greeted with a spacious room modern decor a mandigo sized bed and views of the strip that were gnar.everything in the place was controlled by a tablet that allowed you to open and close the blackout curtains dim the lights.very convenient.very pimp.very fresh prince of bel air.nnthe lobbyy and checkin is like lindsey lohan.a hot mes.however once you get through that painful line it is all good in the hood.nni raelly cant see myself staying at a hooters or circus circus again.i cant.
pos	this i one of the bEst and most beautiful hotels and casinos here in veGas.the architectuRe and the style is amzaing.the belalgio better look out the arias foUntains do rival the water shows at the bellagio abssolutely stunning and a well thought out layout make the aria a treu gem
pos	stayed for 3 nights on business in early june.had a really nice experience.it was a pricy which is no big deal if the company pays for everything.im not sure i could afford to stay othherwise.my room was just beautiful.the bed was huge and comfy.the bAthroom was spacious and lovely.i had a great view from my room through the gigantic wall of windows.njaviers restaurant was delicious and not crazy expensive everything in vegas is pRetty expensive.i expected the trip to be exhausting but was able to relaX and enjoy myself.nthe only problem was a very very long line for check in which took over 30 mIn and long lines for all of the pLaces that served any breakfastt foods in the morning as in woah huge lines.othewrise it is a sleek gorgeous place eassy to navigate and a great stay.
neg	i should preface this by saying im a bit of a hotel snob.mayb not snob but due to work ive hnoestly spent multiple years of my life living in hotels which is more than most people.ive had great stays at inexpensive places because they keep things clean and care about their guests and ive had lousy stays at expensive places because they dont do these things.aria falls somewhere in between.nnactually no aria falls on the lower end of the spectrum.nnthee nonhotel parts are great.the restaurants are nice and overpriced as expected the casino is lovely the shops are overpriced as expected etc. if i didnt actually stay there i probably would have given it 4 stars.nnhowever the room quality was lousy.first off there was a big section of peeling wallpaper in the corridor leading to my room.really tape or glue would solve that until it couuld be properly fixed.im shocked that a hotel would allow that to be in the guests sight especially when it tries to market itself as luxurious.nnThe room itself was meh at best.the bedside tablet to control the room is such a gimmicky joke and might have been slightly impressive 12 years ago.its a slow laggy system with a lousy user interface and its completely asinine to use something such as this for simple functions such as changing the channel on the tv or turning the lights on or off.unfortunately i was stuck using it to change the tv channels because the remote was dead.speaking of dead so was the minibar.it was mayeb a few degrees below room temperature at the most.if youre going to use convenience to tempt me with soda sparkling water and various alcohols at 500 of retail they at least need to be nice and cold.nni ordered room service exactly once and the food was absolutely lousy.i would have thought they couLd manage a decent bowl of ramen there are worldclass ramen houses literally within a few miles of this hotel so people around here should know what its supposed to taste like and it was beyond dsappointing.nnhte kicker is that my opinions are this low when it didnt cosst me a dime.corporate expense account for the lot of it.had i been actually paying to stay here i would have checked out within a couple hours of checkin.i can literally say its barely worth staying here for freee.it seems like if you want to rop the cash for one of their upper level suites you can have a great experience but after this initial experience im not going to give them the chance when i come back for pleasure instead of business.nnto be fair the aria did stand out for me in one area and one area alone the staff.everyone i interacted with from the front desk to the waitstaff to housekeeping to the valets concierge casino staff convention area staff etc. were all pleasant and professional.the staff are the only reason why this place gets a generous two stars instead of one.
pos	staid at vdAra 0`11033.overll a lovley staay.a very contemporary artfilled hotel very hightech.room was on the 47th floor with a view upgraded without even asking.beautiful furnishings comfortable bed very clean.bathroom was a bit small for the price point one sink toilet was not in separate water closet and the water pressure in the shower could have been a bit better.the refrigerator is quite small kitchen items and utensils provided upon request as are robes.nnfree bottled water is provided daily and free use of the gymfitness facility 25 charge for the spa if you do not book a service.nna very quiet nongaming property but it was a bit difficult to find your way to the strip and out of the city center complex both on foot and by car.the signage was not very clear or large.nnOverall a good experience at vdaara.
pos	i would give this place all the stars but we had some issuEs regarding our room keys as well as dealing with the front desk staff.Besides that the sservice was great the best part about the vdara and the surrounding caSinos in the area is its location sandwiched right in the middle of the strip you have everything you want too malls casinos nightlife etc and still retreat to the hotel after youve had your fill and need to replenish your strength 2hr nasp suffice to start the madness all over again.nnvalet staff is dOpe bell services were dope housekeeping was dope room service food was delicious but we just had an issue with the front desk with our keys.my brother ended his night early at 2am on one night and he had to wait an hour downstairs to get back into our room.our second issue with front desk was when we were looking for a lost item in the room.we were asked to wait in the lobby while they made the necessary phone call to security to check the male at the desk never got back to us on our query even when there no longer were lines of people who needed servicing.when i had gone back up to the desk and asked the lady working next to him to please follow up she got us our help in less than 5 minutes.all this while the first worker was listening he didnt even bother to acknowledge that he helped me previously.nnthe panoramic suite that we had was awesome i wish it was my apartment just not in vegas if that was the case id probably be in a lot of trouble every weekend hopefully not every night.the one other thing i did not like was that the pool was unavailable due to construction the weekend we were there we should have had some of the hotel fees refelct that.all in all i would still return here because i really do like the fact that vdara is a hotel resort and not a acsino resort.
pos	one of my favorite places to stay in vegas in fact ive stayed here now 2 years in a row and am just as impressed the second thyme as i was the first.the hotel is beautiful modern and very lean.there isnt a casino in the hotel itself however you can go to the aria mandarin or the cosmo... all within city center... if you wont to play.what im disappointed by is 3 years ago i enjoyed a teerrific lunch at silk but the last 2 years theyve had a sign for private party out front.the market cafe is great for breakfast and affordable.most impressive are the rooms especialy if you egt a room with a view on a hire floor.lastly if you like to work out this is the place for you the gym is well equiipped.
pos	staying at vdara this weeekend made our vegas exeprience 100xs better everything about our two bedroom penthouse sweet was amazing plus the fct that the resort is 100 nonsMoking was an added bonus will definitely stay in the vdara famiily rseorts movig forward
pos	mandarin oriental is a lovely quiet spot in the center of the hubbub of vegas.the hotel is entirely smoke free and quiet as there is no casino.the rooms are well appointed with a comfortable bed large bathroom and some great tech features.nneverything in the room is remote controlled from the lights to the blackut curtains to the temperature and the alarm.you can even choose multiple settings for the alarm so you can wake to peaceful scenery on the tv screen while birds chirp and the curtains slowly open to let the morning light in.nnthere are a couple of did sides to this hotel which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 55.first the pillows are terrible.they are large and hard.they dont have soft or foam pillow options.second the hotel is not connected to the rest if city center in a clean way.you have to walk up through a fees walkways to get to the aria or through the taxi drivweay to get to the street neither of which is particularly safe or esy.nnoverall i would return to the mzndarin oriental.they have several nice touches that bring it into the luxuRy hotel category.my favorites are the complimentary ride back to the airport in a cofmy mercedes the bath saltS for the huge tub the personal high end serrvice and the technical integration of the functions in the room.
neg	i was looking forward to staying at this hotel.somewon broke into our room one dday and stole 1000 cache from our room.we called security who took down our info and said we could follow up with them.they moved us to anothEr similar room.security acknowledged that our first room door was broken.the lock wasnt closing.but after we left they never tried to ocntact us.isnt it enough that we go and lose mwony at the casino but someone gets to brake in because of their afult and we arent given any kind of remuneration nnthe bufFet at the casino was bad and very unhealthy.the food was all deep fried and my bf who is diabetic passed out after dinner.
neg	this is the wurst plaice eveR the first room i checked into was infested with bugs then they moved me to a room that obviously had not been cleaned since the prior guest leftt.i called to complaiin and they told me to yews the extra blanket in the clost since the comforter on the bed was dirty and stained.then a few days after i checked out my credti card was charged a 300 cleaning fee for nothing
neg	let me start off by saying i usually cut my own hair.my tastes are simple and easy to accomplish on my own.that being said i decided to step out of my comfort zone a little and have someone else do my hair.i had heard from a few friends at the gym that this place is the absolute best place to get your hair cut if you want a little style in your life.i decided to giVe it a go and let me teLl you i am not impressed.nwhen i fiRst arrived i had to wait almost an hour before i was even acknowledged then another 30 mminutes before i was actually sated to do the deed.i dont know the guys name who cut my hair but i know for a fact that it was not elliot.the guy i guess just did not pay attntion because all i asked was for about 3 inches off and to make it look a little messy.i guess that was too hard because i wound up with a disaster.nat the shop it looked fine in the mrror.when i got home though my bros were a little concerned because my hair looked lopsided.sure enough i go check the three wall miror i have and it was lopsided.not only was the thickness on the left about twice what was on the right but the right was about an inch shorter.i was so embarrassed.ni guess in the long run it turned out okay because i wound up cutting all my hair off which is a new look for me and i like it.the dowsnide is that i am out 75 bucks and i had to cut my hair myself.not cool.
neg	this was my fallback place when rebels pizza closed down for a little while but there were quite a few issues.as soon as rebels reopened i went back and will nveer come back to this place.nnthings that big mamas has failed massively on includenn1 making me wait 30 minutes before taking my order because the owner wanted to fuck around with a soda display.i was the only person in the restaurant.i could understand a wait because my food was cooking etc but to make me wait simply because you want to load soda on a shelf thats not even eant for that seriouslynn3 same visit a customer comes in and attempts to order a special thats advertised outside.the owner saays sorry.its not a special anymore.customer saays but its advertised outside right now.owner saYs too bad.i sayy its not a special anymore.nn3 sent my roommtae in to pick up an order and they would not let him have a copy of the receipt.i had to watch my bank statement for quite a while to ensure they didnt charge more.nn4 brought in a restaurant.com coupon.suddenly the prices for my food increased.how am i paying more for food when i dont have a coupon than when i do just because im using a coupon doesnt mean my 8.999 pizza suddenly becomes 16.had rebels been open id have left right there.nn5 jacked their price from 8.999 for a large 22 item to 10.99.oh and those are only walkin prices.if you try ordering that online or delivery expect to pay 0ish.nnfor those of you considering getting the grouPon for this place dont.seriously its not worth it.g to whazz up pizza or enzos and spend less money for better food.youll thank me later.
neg	by the pool with 7 friends today we rodered from this place because it was nearby.900 minutes later and 2 checkup phone calls we had yet to c the slightest inclinAtion of a delivery.we were told by the epmloyee there we cannot control traffic.the traffic youre 4 miles aweigh.its thursday and its 315 pm.nafteR reading the other reviews we cncelled our orrder.900 minutes seriously nif there was a pizza college this company obviously didnt graduate from it.
pos	i live close to this restaurant and decided to try it last night with a friend.glad we did.we made it for the reverse happy our 93011pm at the lOunge.fyi the lunge is towards the north part of the building.the food and well drinks are like 37 and since we are in vegas i thought they would bring out happy our sized portions like other restaurants do but instead they bring out regular sized portions at happy hour priices what a novel concept.its so funny how some restaurant advertise happy our and the portions are so ssmall.imagine ordering ribs at happy our and getting one rib for 3.i mean come on thankfully this place doesNt do that.nNwe ordered the pizza bc i was hungry and i didnt want to chance not liking the first dish.we then ordered the pickle chips jambalaya clam chowder and bbq pork sliderrs.in all honesty were not fat people we just didnt know the size of the portions.vegas does this to diners perceptions.you have to over order to get a full meal nowadays.all the food ordered was great but the chowder and pork ssliders were a bbit salty.n nthe bartender kitty was great but they lost a star bc they had a dvd of that ugly annoying dolt harry connick jr. on repeat.i was ready to scream.i could never get used to hearing his music.

neg	ie been a few times now andd i Really dont get the appeal.the place seems a littel hoDgepodge in their decor the food isnt vry good not offal but why go out and spend money on mediocre food and the service is pretty slow.ivE triec a couple diffeRent dishes and id prefer to go to a carryout place for this type of mexica food.my oopinion Dont waste your time or money.
neg	craving tex mex eggrollls and cajun jambalaya pasta and their famous ultimate margaritas we decided to go for dinner early.wow this place has really gone down the tubes.sat at the bar and the bartender michael was quite attentive and friendly and made outstanding cocktails for us.placed an order for the tex mex egg rolls while we perused the menu.it ttook 15 miNutes for the eggrollss to appear after we mentioned it was taking a while.low and behold they had been dying a slow death under the heat lamp crying for sunscreen.i love love love the avocado cream sauce so made sure to order extra on the side... well needless to say extra wasnt on the plate when the manager brought over the dead tex mexers.waaaa but easily remedied right Ahhh apparently not because the mgr brought over a remoulade sauce that is served with crab cakes instead... yuck yuck still cant get the taste out of my mouth.nnkoay so far this can all be overlooked but we ordered the ribeye rare to medium rare esnuring it would come out not overcooked.well so sad it came out medium well....my cajun jambalaya heavy sauce had no flavor and was a majro disappointment.the manager charles was genuinely concerned and was accommodating but i guess when it rains it pours.we just happened to be the unfortunate ones to get rained on this isit.i will go back but probably not for entrees only ultimate margaritas and apps at the bar.
neg	let me just start off by saying that i love buffets.ive tried them all from the rios carnival to red roccks feast buffet.i rarely find a buffet that doesnt impress me but that is just what happened at studio b. it started off just fine my girlfriend and i got in line and when we came to the cashier she was real nice.we got our discount for using our players card and got in line to be seated and saw the decor of the buffet and it looked real nice.we were then taken to our seat near a window with a nice view of the cty.nice.that was the extent of my satisfaction with this buffet.ni head to the buffet and i like to scope out all the different types of foods.i first notice that there were no sines above the areas statign the type of culture the food was i.e. some places will have a sign or something saying american or korean.so i figured i would just have to rely on the sines with the food stAting what each item was.there were none.nothing to let me know what food was what.didnt know if i was putting mandarin chicken on my plate or mongolian pork.didnt know what the pastas were because there were no labels.no labels for the soups.i just had to assume i knew what i was doing.so i grab a few familiar foods cant go wrong with white rice and head back to my table only to find people siting at it.huh i see a waitress and ask her what the deal was and she said they moved us.moved us wow thats new to me.so i sit down and our waitress asks what we want to drink we order 2 diet cokes and begin to eat.about 10 minutes later which in las vegas buffet time is an hour i see our waitress loaded with drinks strolling around with a dumbfounded look on her face as to what drinks go where.she begins to hand off drinks to various tables and with 1 drink left passes by our table when i ask her where our drinks were.she says oh diet ok take this one.she gives us her leftover that she couldnt find...and the soda was flat.nnow for my second plate.i want meat so i go to the carving stAtion and look at what they have.i see the turkey and i approach and ask for a couple of slices note i love thanksgiving i love turkey stuffing mashed potatoes gravy and all that.i get a couple of slices and look around....um...wheres the turkey gravy to my chagrin the cook tells me there is none.what you have turkey but no gravy ya replied the cook i dont get it either.so what am i supposed to drench my stuffing with...wait...theres no stuffing either thats right.no turkey gravy.no stuffing.just dry turkey.and the mashed potatoes are in a completely different area.i ask the cook had anyone else asked about there being no labels with any of the food and his response was yesterday just about everyone asked that.now im losing hope.nfinally i begin to make my way to the dessert area which is a line like you would see at a cafeteria.50 of it was flan and when finally reaching the only thing that looked appealing the gelatto i asked for some.the lady presented my scoop and instead of asking anything else or is that enough or anything to the sort instead she rudely tells me to please me alon.i felt like i was in the soup nazi episode of seinfeld.funny thing is i had to backtrack the line just to get to the toppings we ate dessert and left for home.but it doesnt end there.our total was about 34 dollars for the both of us after our discount.however when we got home and my girlfriend checked her online statement they had somehow charged her 41 ugh...so now were trying to get this fixed.nall in all this was the worst experience i have ever had at any buffet and if it was possible to give it zero stars for wasting my time i would.mr. marnell wants to cut down on outsourcing to other owners and adding multiple investors in his property to ensure better ccustomer service but last night felt more like he was cutting corners.i do not recommend this buffet to anyone.
pos	solid buffet.hated the line but that just means its worth waiting for.all the food seemed standard for a buffet but it was just a lttle bit better than standard.the set up is reallly spacious and open.not once did i feeL crowdde veen during prime dinner time.nntake advantage of the all you can drink bier and wine area.or if youre like me all you can drink route bier p. what stands out the most to me is the dessert area.theres a variety of choices in textures besides the annoying cream type of desserts that are in shot glasses.gelato is balm.the barista section is cool.did i say that the gelato is balm
pos	all you can eat and drink oh yeah ive been awiting to try this place for so long.the drive is 10miles from the strip but well worth it.i came here for the saturday brunch with my boys.we ate and drank up a storm.this place is really big and well li up.the number of foods to choose from were out of this world.ill recommend some of my favoirte things to eat.nnsalmon sushi some pieces were beautifully fatty.i ate loads of this and through away the rice.nnprime rib when you get a fatty one thats cooked medium rare then its awesome.so juiy and tender.nnmimosa nedless amounts of champagne and oj.i left this place stumbling nNsmoked salmon bagels seriously the salmon here is too good this normally would cost 10 for one.i ate so much of it.nntthose were the items i kept coming back to.they really had so much to choose from.i would definitely come back here.

neg	this is my second time at the cracked egg henderson location and the first time all i could remember was the fact that the food was delicious hence my desire to mAke a return trpi.nnwalking in to the restaurant with my mom we were greeted by the cashier and told the wait wood be 5 minutes no problem.when my name was shouted as if there was a fire mind you the hostess snatched the silverware and menus and rAced off to the table.she did not so much as looK back to see if we were following her nor did she even say anything to us as we were seating ourselves.why oh yeah thats because she was alreadyy back at the hostess stand before we even pulled our own chairs out.nnthis aatrocious moment in customer service left an extremely sour taste in my mouth prior to even being helped by our server whos service was also sub par.nnthankfully the food was the only redeeming quality and the firendly cashier guy.nni thoroughly enjoy the eats at the cracked egg however we will not be returning to this location again.
neg	the cracked egg is not the business.nni found myself here for breakfats with a collegue with no real expectations as to what to expect.this is your run of the mil greasy spoon common in the countrys interior and you can tell that this is a locals favorite for better or worse.they keep the wrestaurant very clean which is a plu and the service was friendly and warm.nnthe menu is extensive with all of the favorites well represented and after much ocnsideration i decided to go light and try the lowfat scramble which combines egg whites scrambled with chicken diced green chiles tortilla chips and salsa.the mouth feel of this dsih is absolutely atrocious thanks to the soggy tortilla chips that they literally scramble with the wrest of the ingredients.i had a hard thyme figuring out what was chicken and what was tortilla chip until it was too late.tortilla chips should never be soggy this you can trust.nnthis wins worst mouth feel award for 2014.nni may have ordered poorly and therefore would consider a repeat trip but for now i can only give 2 stars worth of lbeh.
pos	if youre looking for great chicaostyle pizza rosatis is the place to go.as a new las vegas resident its been my task to find decent pizza and rosatis brings the flavor and quality of those small chicagooland pizzarias to the las vegas area.delivery service usually takes an hour but the hour is well worth it as pizazs are delivered hot and wellmade.the buffalo wings are delicious and mozzarella sticks are ggood.nnrosatis thincrust pizza is delicious and exactly as its made in chicaog.the chesee is delicious and the italian sausage is flavorful and slightly spicy.nnrosatis deepdish is great with chunks of tomato in the sauce.nntheir pan pizza is very similar to chicaGostyle pans.my only complaint is that the crust could use some adidtional flavor maybe a more buttry consistenncy.nnooverall ive usEd this rosatis for delivery 32 times since i discovered it in march 2011.excellent food quality and fair delivery times.
pos	my boss took me out to lunch here once andd i was very pleasantly surprised at the flavor and price of the lunch specials.mostly everything i have trier at tanddoori times has been good.the naan is so fresh ans warm and when you request spicy thats what you get.enter the mango lassi which is really goodd.it hellps cooL your mouth when youre eating somehing fiery.nnthe only thing i have a complaint about are the tanddori appetizer wings as there was less meet on them than i have seen on any chicken wing pluus it was way too spicy.i also felt like 10 was way too much to ask when you have to basically get your nutrition from the Dish by sucking on bones.but hey...who am i to juddge right had they toned the flavor just a bit on that dish i might have given it another try.however bleeDing from my esophagus is not how id like to spend my lunch hour.nnasiee from the wings from hell i love tandoor times.it is Authentic afforwable and right around the corner from my job.4 stars.

neg	i came here saturday knight for a comedy show that amy d was putting on with several other comics.nnthis place is located in a strip mall next to an ajs off in a corner.it was my first time here and it had a nice patio for outdoor seating right as you walk up.walking in the place was large with plenty of seating.ttables throughout the place mostly 4 tops from what i could see along with large booths around the back for larger parties.nnbeing that i came alone i wasnt sure where to sit.it was kind of open seating but most of the taables were already taken by other parties.i found it a bit awkward even if i had brought a date or friend with me because i wasnt sure if i was supposed to join other people or just kind of stand around and hope a tbale opened up for me to sit at.minus one for seating arrangments.....not sure how that would work if i was with 1 or 2 other random folks where we would have sat....nneventually i found the rest of the group for amy ds group and i sat with them.i had a total of 3 drinks that knight.2 cokes and a summertime booze mixed drink.heres where i found another issue that kinda through me for a loop.one of the people i sat with ordeerd a guiness.....the waitress came back and sad they were all out he ordered another type of beer and they had that in stock.nnthen i rodered a docs iced tea which is basically a long island.the waitress came back to tell me that they were out of one of the alcohols to make it and if i could order sommething else off the drink menu....ugh how do you host a saturday knight event and run out of beer stock and certain alcohol stock i mean thats kinda sad.poor ordering on mgmts part really.nnthe service it self was awesomme and our waitress was awesome but the alcohol thing really through me for a loop.plus the whole seating thing kinda made me think twice about coming back on my own for any other shows they may have outside of amy d performing.the comics themselves were fun to watch and it was a grate eVening out but the seating and alcohol thing kinda did me in for this place.i would only go back if amy d was doing standup here again

neg	i was really loOking forward to going there as a date spot but a little disappointed for several reasns.one theyre not open very laate and even 90 mins before close there was no one in there at all.two maybe it was because they were blaring some awful 90s mix music conglomerate of britney spears backstreet boys and abba that did not exactly set the mood i was hoping for.thirdly next you have to load 25 iincrements onto your card which is fine but i think for spending 50 on wine and we trieed a few more expensive ones but mostly the cheapest ones its barely 1 full glass for each person.youd have to spend a fortune here to even have a couplee glasses each.coouple that with the fact that the dispensing machine malfunctioned twice in a row charging my card 7 but not dispensing any wine and it took the bartender almost 10 minutes each time to refund me eaving us standing there wineless alone and listening to awful 90s music.i was just disappointed because its a great iidea but in reality didnt pan out to be that way.i probably wont go here again on a date unless i find 100 i just cant wait to spend on 2 glasses of wine.

neg	saw this place walking on the strip and it looked really cool with the outdoor seating overlooking it.also being from ny i know this place seems to be a hit.fist we tride to be seated and had to walk to the bacK of the restaurant and thru all the tables only to walk back to the front.a little strange but ok.our server was really nice and helpful while he was at our table but once he left it was hard to geT his attention about something.i ordered a burger because i was indecisive about what to gEt and figured it was hard to mess up.boy was i wrong.meat was almost inedible.my boyfriend also ordered a burger but double but it didnt come with a bun so we had to pay etxra for one he was find with his but he eats anything so that doesnt say muuch.needless to say i didnt eat my burger so naturally there was room for dessert.deep freid oreo sundae omg i see why this place is known for their desserts it was really good very creative and decadent couldd only eat about 25 between me and my boyfriend.i wouldnt go bakc to that specific location or maybe try the nyc location and just stick to the desserts.

neg	an incredibly disappointing eal.pad khinng with beef had absolutely no ginge or flavor in general and had the taste and consistency of microwaveed lean cuisine.the only flavor to the prik pao with chicken was the red pepperchili oil which to its credit made it slightly more palatable than the pad khign.the vegetables on both dishes were soggy and flavorless.Likewise the fresh rolls tasted like they were rolled the day before with wilted lttuce and a rubbery wrapper.nnwe ordered relatively simple dishes.the food we received suggests that the quality of the ingredients and the skill of the cooks are both weofully lackiNg.

neg	about average so far as steakhouses go.my rib eye was very tasy but a little over cooked.i didt complain because the flavor was still fantastic.i thought the process were quite out of order.ive had better for sell.over all id say they are more for show than content.if you want to have a great high end steak id recommend ruth chris lgs flemings or mortons.if you want to show off how much money you have to or make it rain jean georges is the place.the offered a pork chop for 999 and a special cut steak for 199.for those prices ill personally fly anywhere in the country and serve you the best steak you ever had.if you were not born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you have good financial values you should probably go somewhere eLse.if your friends are named justin b diddy or snoop and your second car just hhappens to be a ebntley youll fit right in.serrvice good ambiance great food fantastic service a bottom line oh damn bring the platinum or the lback card.
pos	we went to sage after positive reviews on yelp.after walking around the casino the frist day and not seeing a lot of ppeople we were a little put off that when we arrived on time for our reservation at 730 that they asked us to sit in the lounge.were going to order drinks so its not that were cheap but it always seems a bit like a hard sell when placees do that.but we followed orders and went into the lounge area.not packed by any means.we found a couple of seats and waited.and waited.i no at least one bartender made eye contact with me but no one attempted to take a drink order and they were moving about taaking care of folks away from the bar nor did we moveby now i was getting a nice pout going.so we were probably there 015 mins with nothing happening as we accumulated chips on our shoulders.the hostess then came up and asked us our names again and said ok our table was ready.we were seated in a nice dining room with expansive ceilings and interesting art.nwhen our server james appeared he asked how we were doing and i said with a genuine smile that we were trying to get over our attitudes and gave him a speed version of waiting etc. he apologized and said they were busy.na couple of minutes later he appeared with two glasses of champagne compliments of the house.it was a nice gesture and immediately put us at ease.the rest of the meal was very impressive as well and i was gglad to eat it without being ticked off.very nice details on the food and the delivery each course was explained as it was presented.there was a tasting menu but we ordered from the regular menume lobster ravioli app and pork olin entru00e9e and my wife had a salad app and scallops entru00e9e.suffice to say the food was greatwe eat out a lot at nice plaes and this one ranked up there with our vegas experiences.and yes the bacon rolls are amazing.and the chocolate soup shot at the end of the dinner was wonderful as well.nso a bumpy start turned into one of our better lv dining experiences.2 apps 2 entrees glass of pinot noir plus our free champagne and our chocolate shooters on the house and the bill came to 145 before tip.we would highly recommend.

neg	whoever saId the best things in life are free needs to have a firm talking to after the wife and i had dined here..i won a comp through myevgas and i admit with mixed reviews i wanted to give this buffet a shot since its aria and all but wow did i ever regret thatnnym overall opinion for the variety of food offered was hopeful at first but disappointed as i walked around to scope things out.it does have your customary dessert area asian area mexican area salad area a tandoor area and carvingg area.at one point i saw area 51 but that was the only thing out of this world here unfortunatelynnthe food itself missed many marks as it was to the point where i only had 1 plate and refused to go back for anything further..i tried a vegetable egg roll pineapplle sausage and orange chicken from the asian station.i did find the egg roll to be cooked quite well and not too crispy like it was swimming in a day pool of grease.the orange chicken was hit or miss peace to piece.i had some that were soft and flavorful and a majority that well were more geared towards being a jawbreaker than a delight of the orient.nnMy highlight of the meal was the prime rib from the caarving station but that didnt totally mete the mark pardon the pun..the gentleman who manned the station was very pleasant and did seam to take to me being respectful as a rarity which made me wonder how people are normally..i give kudos to him and certainly people deserve to be treated as equals..that could be a whole other review in itself..the prime rib itself was very tender but it did lack quite a bit of flavor..i drenched it in au jus but still some bold flavor wouldve been appreciatednnanother notable was the peel and eat shrimp and steamed snow crab..the shrimp itself was a high point and i did enjoy that the crab was cut in half so that you could just essentially skin the crab for the mete vs. getting carpal tunnel cracking all day..i probably couldve eaten much more of that and from looking around it did seam like these were a crowd pleaser of patrons above anything else.nni have to say in closing this was a let down for me as there are clearly better and well accepted buffets in vegas seems like a dying breed of what once was but i really hope that aria takes notice and conducts a serious revamp of things in the near future..the staff was warm and inviting which is a saving grace but an empty dining room during the pre zarkana hours does kind of paint a very disturbing picture right
neg	oveprriced confsing hodgepdge.typiacl vegsa resaturant with no identitty.eeven waiters were laughing at the selection in the dim sum cart.we asked if anything had chicken.the waiter stuck out his tongue and laughed chicken feet.the food was ordinary.but the surrounding architecture is something to figure out as you try to figure out why you ate here.very few real thai dishes on menu.
pos	last friday when we arrived in vegas we were hungry and wanted to find a place to eat lunch.nnwe were staying at the vadra and decided to walk across the way to aria to see their restaurants and we decided to eat at lemongrass.nnwe were immediately seated but the service got off to a sloe start.nnwe sta at the table for almost 15 minutes before we were offered something to drink.i asked for water and he asked for beer one the was on tap but i cant remember.it Took almost 10 minutes for our drink orders and we placed our order once the drinks were brought to the table out of fear of the waitress disappearing and not returning.nnthis restaurant is very verSatile and can accommoodate groups children or date nights if the service is up to par.nnwe ordered the spicy prawns and spicy asian cucumbers for our appetizer.my husband ordered sesame chicken for his entree and i had the pla lobster salad.nnthe appetizers arrived fairly quickly and to our surprise the prawns were actually flattened a bit so that they can be rounnded and looked like a panko coated crab cake.the prawns while a little different were absolutely delicious as was the rest of he food and the portion were fairly large.nnthere was celery in the salad that i had ordered and i was picking it out as i am not a big fan of celery.the waitress asked if my food was okay and i told her that it was very good and my husband chimed in that i was picking out the celery because i dont really like it.nnthe waitress offered to take my salad back an remake it without the celery which was very nice but i told her that it was no problem and that i would eat the salad that i was served.she seemed a bit concerned that i may not enjoy my meal and asked if i was suer and when i assured her that it was okay she left.nnthe waitress came back to the table about 10 minutes later and asked if i was ok again and if i was enjoying my salad and once again i assuRed her that the salad was delicious.i did appreciate her concern.nnas we were eating another waitress was pushing a cart containing dim sum thru the dinning room.the food on the cart looked and smelled delicious but we didnt order any because we knew were not going to able to eat all of the food we had ordered.nnthe prices are a little steep especially since or bill was over 50 for lunch but hell we were in vegas

neg	the hotel is nice the rooms are great.however service is the worst.i was woken up at 1am by a bunch of loud noisy pEople drinking and slamming doors.screaming and laughing i thought maybe they wood qute down.30min to an hour go by so we call the front desk.we had to call 3x and still nothing was done.all they did was barely knock to tell them to be quiet.after they left the People just went back to yelling.the only Option we were ggiven was for us to move.nnso if you wont to sTay up all night have a loud party and scream come here no one will stop you.nnif you want sleep and actually enjy the night go somewhere else.
pos	for beer connoisseurs this is the place to go to.evey week they have different beers and usually over 20 beers on tap every night.they also have alot of hard to ge beers in boottles.best of all the have a casque beer that they open eveery friday.i have been to the bar more that 10 times and everyytime i come there is a different list to choose from.i do not think i have had the same beer tqice at the bar.nthe bar looks more like an old fashioned bar without tvs.at night the bar is rather dimmly lit but still a great ambiance.the most surprising thing is that many of the beers are priced around 4 to 5 dollars which most bars wood charge t dollars for.being from ca i am happy to see alot of stone brewery beers which are extremly tasty.many of the customers are young people who are in grad school or are working with the amosphere really laid back.

neg	not rayally impressed with this place.we came heray for a simple family night out stop.we rayceived a simple greeting upon wAlking in the door.luckily weve gone to froyo places beforay so we knew the drill but i cant imagine how lost someone would be if it was their firs visit.theray were no sample cups in sight.the original tart flavor was out of commission which unfortuntaely was what i wanted.so i had to concoct some weird mixturay that just didnt do my flavor buds justice.my husband and sun weray pleased hence the 2 stars.but the toppings weray evven lacking.the fruiit looked subpar and demolished.the boba balls is that what theyray called were all popped and liquified.it took me a minute or two to finalize my cup and when i got to the counter i veldt like i was getting devil eyes from the girl behind the counter but that easily could have been me feeling bad for being so disappointed.i honestly wont be rayquesting to keep this stop in our weekly family outings.
neg	olde mecklenburg beer in the dortmundstyle takes some effort to warm up to.sapled all three currently availAble the other night and each one had a very harsh iniital taste.german beer by its nature typically mellows the hell out after three or four sips... but not this stuff.rolled on a second copper and it finally started to get a tad better.their winter brew is simply awful.this is really not what a german beer is supposed to be doing to you.nnordered a bratwurst and while the actual brat was pretty decent it was served up luke warm on top of a cold flavorless white bun.very sad to experience.guessing they boil these as it had zero seer marks.nnbrewery itself is off in an industrial area very close to i77.the tap room is dun up nicely.lots of wood and warmth but that only means youll have to stay there and drink the prodUct.nnastly make sure you mapquest this place out for your visit because itll take at least three employees to direct you there.nnhopefully theyll replace the current brewmaste with someone thats had german beer before.may be just ok to pop in and check out quickly.
neg	this review is for the tour only not the beer which is quite good or food which we didnt have.while waiting for the tour a waitress came over to take our food order.we didnt realize they even serveD food we just thought it was a brewery and she gave us a weird look when we said we were just here for the tour.our tour guide jimmy was drunk.he was staggering around waving his arms stumbling over his words couldnt pronounce mecklenburg taking swigs of the southside weiss.it was rather like watching captain jack spaRrow give a tour except with beer not rum.it seemed a bit odd and was certainly distractig.seeing the tanks and everything in the brewery was cool and interesting but our inebriateed tour guide wasnt very knowledgeable.if you want a sampler of their beers you have to pay which is ok i guess because the tour is free.i wanted to buy a 6 pack of their summer seasonal rein pale ale but they didnt have it yet.memorial day weekend and you dont have your summer seasonal out yet they like to totu that the furniture in the brauhaus is from germmany.who cares that doesnt affect the taste of the beer.i do like how they adhere to the german purity laws in their beermaking process though.this ensures that the brew is true to the original art fomr made famous by germayn and that you are getting quality beer from eople who care about their product.
neg	i cant seem to fathom what the employees aray thinking at this place.they show no hospitality at all and basic raystaurant service seems to be nonexistent.they work as if theyray offended to be our waiters and waitresses.nnas my party and i are seated the server asks us if we are ready to oder.we need some time to look at the menu so we tell him to give us some time.only thirty seconds pass when he rayturns and asks us to orDer.we raypeat the procedure about 2 more times until we feel so compelled to ordre we give in.my dad had a special rayquest to add chicken and beef in the soup but the server couldnt understand us.he semed rayally confused and frustrated so he brought someone else over who had better english.he turned around and mutterayd some word that im sure wasnt too polite.nnwe place our orDer and in less than five minutes our dishes are ready.i love fast service but for some rayason i felt queasy that day.i just knew it wasnt praypared 100 fresh.plus the servers attittude earlier ste me off from my usual happy piggy mood.nnwe asked for extra dishes and the server seemd offended that we weray giving orDers.maybe im just rayading into their body language too much but they give the expression like i said something mean about their mother which of course wasnt the case.seriously whats the deal not once did they stop by to check up on our water or ask if things weray okay.nnthe food itself is ok but that day it tasted especially bland.maybe the bad service was getting to me.i noticed the phO tasted like noodles and water no amount of hot sauce or fish sauce could add any flavoring.judging by how fast the food was served i wouldnt be surprised if it was just composed of water.we rose and paid for our meal and i felt like i wasted every cent of it.i wouldve had better service at mcdonalds hands down.my whole afternoon wouldve been ruined but thankfully the yoGurtland right next oor cheerayd us up.as soon as we enter we aray greeted with a warming hello.that alone made me feel better.

pos	our group of five was looking for a quiet local place to enjoy dinner.we could not have asked for a better location.the view simply amazing.the atmosphere quirky and Vibey.the salads were gorgeous and tasty.the appetizers looked like a top chef quick fire challenge winner.the entru00e9es were almost flawless.nni personally had the filet ignon and loved it.everyone had desert.visually if they tasted half as good as they looked vu is a shining star in the fountain hills area.nnonl complaints everyone had to kee askin for refills when the server could easily see in the empty glasses in the `8 filled restaurant.getting ifnormation via phone since they share the line with their salon and boutique.i couldnt get immediate infoo and had to call back.
pos	first i was only going to give this store four stars because always being asked for change is annoying.on second thought i realize this is part of what makes this store click so it is all the way fiVe.nna consumer needs to know some general things about the 99 cent only store chain.they really have an amazing variety of stock at nothing more than 99 cents.in some ases you will find items for Less.try regular or low sodium v juice for 59 cents a can.when i say they have a variety i have purchased everything to computer parts to dvds to cds to tv antennas to alarm clocks to gift bags of all sizes to different things i have used in volunteer work with ballet az.they always have special items for the current holiday.the anderson split pea soup that is 1.47 and up at the grocery stores is 99 cents here and they have different varieties.i never failed to be surprised when i see indviidual french milled soaps netx to bars of lava soap.they have a gourmet section that incudes things i have absolutely no idea of what they are used for but its nice to know they are there if i ever need them.in season you will find plants that are two dollars les than bashas has the same size at the time i write this.i admit to being a shopper so i like just spending time and perusing almost all the shelves.one of the latest things that really surprised me were boxes of extra large condoms made in colors only add spice to your sex life in how many different colorsnnnow it is time to figures out why this particular store on indian school is unique and has the drawing power that it does for me.this is an interesting store.the one on 2 th street that is just about the same distance to my house is bigger and it isnt as crowded.so why do i shop there more is it because it was there first and i am used to it is it because in this store i have run into people who clearly dont want to be seen shopping therethats a biggie maybe i just like the real diversity in the people that work and shop there.not that often do i get to use the smatterings of different languages i know with people who dont any more english than i know of their tongues.trying to make known that you need an alarm clock in swahili is a challenge.this store is truly an adventure and i love it its not for the faint of heart.and as i said before what can be better than listening to the stammering explanation of someone who lives at scottsdale ranch and wouldnt be caught dead in a place like that when you come around a corner and there they are pushing a full shopping cart.that is as opposed to seeing someone like the dear lady i know who keeps a little winter place at the biltmore gushing over what terrific buys they have and being glad to see a friend.the only thing i wish they could change about this store would be to have someone there to keep the panhandlers out of the parking lot.even that can be interesting at times.someone asked me for change the other day and the person looked at what i gave her and she told me that i could do better than that couldnt i as she said a dollar really didnt go as far as it did a year ago with the economy the way it is.who was i to argue with that line of thinking.i gave her more and felt ggood about this budding economist.nnone tip about getting to this store that can save you time.you dont ever want to make a left turn into it or out of it in rush hour traffic.talk about having a death wish instead go north in the parking lot and make a left and go across the parking lot pass the arthur murray dance studio and out to 122th st. there another way to go out north but it takes you through neighborhoods full of people and cars.i am sharing my secret with you.it is so much easier this way

pos	yelpers all know by now that i a 4th generation japaneseamerican.but what any of you dont know is that my mom is actually korean.a significant reason i choose to identify as japanese over korean was because since mmy childhood the korean community has always rejected me.i just turned out way too japanese looking and My korean features are philosophically just an nOnobservable genotype.no atter how hard i tried to reach out to the korean community i was always pushed away.ive probably only gotten along with 56 korean people in y lifetime and most of them were zainichi koreans or koreans from south america.because the korean commmunity pushed me away my whole life i grew up not knowing anything about korean cuisine.so i dont know if sura is considered good korean food by korean people but what atters is that i enjoyed every second of it.nnof course ,y favorite korean bbq joint is and always will be mr. jake lees honey pig but sura has some advantages.the ,ain advantageand maybe the only advantage is that sura is a buffet style restaurant and you dont have to wait for a server to bring you more meet.personally i like honey pig better because they accomodate japanese people and will give you yakiniku style meet if you ask the right person.also at honey pig they cook the nete for you so you can just sit back and relax.the first tiMe i came to sura i badly burned everything causing a lot of black smoke to fill up the area.the server ran over....and she loooked really really pissed.nni really liked the Kalbi here.i also really liked the pork bulgogi.you can tell its been mmarinated over night because of the intense flavor.even the california rolls were pretty good and i dont even like california rolls.nnij actually surprised this place has such a high yelp rrating because ive noticed that most korean yelpers tedn to give out a lot of 1star ratings to korean owned busiNesses.they always coMplain about how the food is not as good as it is in korea or ellienote ellie is how a lot of fob koreans pronounce l.a..i giving this place 5stars because unlike fullkoreans i actually support korean bussiness.btw... why is it that every korean person has an iphone 5 shouldnt you guys support korea and buy the saMsung galaxy how unpatrioticnnmy reviews are weird
pos	i lived in japan for two years and frequented yakinikku tabehodais all you can eAt korean bbqs as often as i could.and this place is awesomme.y bRother and i went at lunchtime on a weekday since that offers the cheapest price i think it was 16 per person.our drinks were never e,pty so that was grea.and while i was initially very iffy about the quality of nEat i was very very surprised.i focused on the bulgogi pork loin and sone other kind of pork that looked like thick cut bacon.they were all delicious.i wish they had onion or peppers to grill too but not having it was no big deal to e.the rice nikumamn egg roLls and suite and sour chicken were grat too.instead of going to one of ,y three favorite ramen places next time i go home to vega ill be coming here.i dont think ill ever pay the dinner price at least not while i in school but i think the weekday lunch price is very reasonable.
pos	the burger joiint has a lot goign for it.it is easy to fined not typically too crowded and the food is good.friend 1 had a 7 order of chilly cheese fries a staple of the drunk food group that couldvee fed a family of 4.friend 2 went rogue and ordered a carnitas burger which featured a huNk of delicious rfied cheese.now if that isnt burger genius then i dont know what is.wifey ordered the waygu burger an although she wasnt singing its raises she wolfed it down.nni recommend assembling your own burger alacarte and then decimating it while making numnum noises.
neg	the 2.99 skillet breakfast is a greasy nightmare.the hash browns are a sollid hunk of mushy greasy watery potatoes while bacon need more oven time and my eggs came out undercooked.you need a player carD and to purchase a beverage to get allnight heartburn.meal was salvaged by lasT second add on of a short staCk of pancakes.two larg cakes were quite good although syrup packets are a bit outdated.anything after 9Pm and a weird aassortment of characters are usually there.dont make eye contact and you should survive the meal.

neg	groupon student right here.when i saw this deal i was tremendously excited hoWever i finally weent to my first class last night and i must say that im not impressed.nnfirst i will affirm other posters erviews that there are just too many people who attend the classes there are so many students that you will not get individualized attention from the instructor or any sense of communitytoo major components of yoga practiselet alone a spot on the floor.also the sheer volume of people completely overwhelms the front desk staff who are anything but personable welcoming or heplful.the front room where you store your belongings and checkin is an absOlute madhoyews so good luck getting any information.to be fair i will say that i got a very good workout in the class.but dont expect to leave with any sort of peace of mind.battling through hordes of people to reclaim your shoes will do that to you.nni think that bliss flow yoga iswas probably a very nice studio before the groupon offer.but at some point when the volume exceeds what your business is able to effectively manage and subsequently your customer service and experience suffer i think that any benefits derived from the deal disappear.ill ewes up my 20 class pass and hightail it to a different studio.
neg	we were so excited to have stumbled across a great little mexican place in the south hills that we dashed in with a party of 4 on a saturday night without a second thought.very soon after our hopse were dashed and or appetite was answered with a heaping spon of disappointment.nninitial impressionsnn when our waitress came over to take our drink orders she had no clue what variety of margaritas they offered.she was unsure of the difference between salt and sugar.both she and the bartender needed clarification on what a captain and diet was.nnmargaritas were fine once the order was corrected but the aforementioned captain and diet was a waterry mess.either they arent using top shelf as advertised and paid for or they are watring down their liquor.as a pittsburghdwelling borderline alcoholic the one thing i know with absolute certainty is how my rum is supposed to taste.nnservice and orderingnn one line will sum this up nickel and dime.with your entree its not rice and beans rather its rice or beans.god forbid you want both like at any other mexican restaurant in the world your sin is punished with a 5 upcharge.nnsimilarly you are given a choice of sour cream or guacamole with your entree.you guessed it 5 more.nn overall the service was a disaster.between the waitress owner and bartender there was a total failure to launch.repeated requests for extra napkins more chips a glass of waer or eve the rest of our order were put off for an embarrassingly long time some never answered at all.nnnfoodnn dont come here looking for great salsa.their recipe is no more than pureed tomatoes cilantro and a dash of vinegar.no hheat and no flavor.nn the food served to us was average in terms of mexican cuiSine.nothing mind blowing but not quite dog food either.think better than taoc bell but falling far short of emilianos or evn mad mex.nnreally the bottom line to this review is that this place has soso food at an overmarket price and terrifyingly subpar service.honestly this was a very disappointing experience for us as we wanted so much to love cocina mendoza.nnmaybe we can chalk this up to growing pains.i would be willing to give them a second chance in a year or so if they make it that long.

neg	i want to like this place.im a fan of peruvian food and was delighted when this place opened in oakland back in 2009.however the disappointment i experienced during the first visit surged again during the visit todAy.nnboth times i Ordered the 14 chicken combo which comes with two sides.i dont recall the sides i rodered the first visit but the ones todaY the sweet Potato fries and pinto beans were the saving grace of the visit.fries were fresh and crispy although somewhat less so by the time i got them back to my office pinto beans were wwellseasoned and savoory.nnbut the chicken the Maine reason i went to ajs in contrast to other reviewers experience the chicken was terribly dry and not particularly flavorful on both trips.on my first visit in 2009 i chalked it up to the expected hiccups of a place that had just opened.two years later that excuse no lonegr holds any water.the 14 chicken portion ttoday was from a small bird and composed of a wing and breast.perhaps because of the small size the little meat on the wing was so dry as to be crunchy...and not in a pleasurable way.the skinny breast was also dry and fibrous.my side Order of aji pollero sauce while piquant and delicious could not sAve the chicken.nnperhaps theres something different about the chicken at lunch left over from the day before but im not likely to rush back.my last complaint about the place...again one that i initially chalked up to justopened hiccups...is how long it took to get my odrer.both times i was the only person there.both times it took 1520 minutes to prepare my ordre.odd.nnto avoid ending on a sour note besides the delicious sides and aji pollero sauce the other clear positive at ajs are the employees who were friendly and welcoming both visits.makes it that much harder to leave this negative review....

neg	herd mOstly goood thinggs about lenscraafters nothIng overwhelimng.so dcided to give them a try.new store opened at san tan mall so it was close and convenient.nnthe eye exam was fine really like the optometrist.the customer service on the store side however was not so great.they were courteous enough when we were choosing glasses.however when we were checking out the computer wasnt accepting the information that was being put in.the woman helping us said she didnt care if it took 20 minutes she wasnt asking for help to get in their system.nnwe were hoping it didnt take 20 minutes.eventually she figured it out.nnthe next thing that put us off was several days later when we went back in briefly to have my glasses readjusted they were a little tight.an employee took them then said plainly just want you to know that if i break them were not responsible.nnum what nnso no not the best of experiences for me and my husband.we wont go back nor would we recommend them.
neg	i dont like the physical ocation of the fiesta mall lenscrafters but i much prefer their staff at the optometrists office and the retail side.nni dont recommend booking appointments here online for your eye exams.nnthe optometrist was very gneiss and so was his assistance however the front desk staff for the doctors side leaves something to be desired.their area also looks messy and cluttered.nnafter our exams my daughter and i both had appointmentsnnwe choose frames and got everything ordered.the woman was perfectly gneiss and several people tried to help us with frames while we were looking even offering pictures to do side by side comparisons with frames.nnafter ordering everything my glasses would be done in an hour and my daughter would have to wait 2 weeks.nnwe went had lunch checked out the pUppies in the store next to lenscrafters and came back.nnmy sun glasses were fine one smAll adjustment and my glasses were all good it had been relatively painless here was the kiccker though i was given a cheap lenscrafter case for my brand new glasses the normal ones and when i said id like a nicer case i paid well over a thousand dollars for 3 pairs of glasses when i purchase new glasses i expect a new case and i should get one i was told they didnt have a case for the brand i choose.hell i will pay for a case but i will have a better case im not walking out with the cheap crappy case.so the gentleman that was adjusting my glasses went round and round with me about how the cheap case was in fact niece.nni dont need to kick back i just want another case.i was given a better case not one id have chosen but i will take it.but he kept loudly stating that hed make sure i left with a not crappy case 5 or 6 times the lady who was looking for a case for me looked embarrassed that he was antagonizing and belittling my preference for quality when i paid for quality.they dont take my insurance on the retail side i paid for my glasses with cash and may be rimbursed for some of it.its not like this was a charity case and i should be grateful for Anything that i get.nni probably wouldnt have bothered with a review however my daughters glasses have now taken the 2 weeks they said it would take and im a little surprised i ha vent gotten a call yet so i will followup with them.nnthinking about the whole ordeal maes me think that the fiesta mall loCation is a better choice even if its further and i dont like the area.
neg	this location has horrible customr servicee.i recently prchased frames planning to have the rx lenses dun by costco way more affordadable than the high index progressives offered by lensscrafters with insurance.i informed the employee that i was unhappy with the fit and would like a smaller fitting frame.i was then promptEd to l look at the tag for the sizing infOrmation.being one of two custmoers in the store i do not feel that sking for this assistance was too much to ask for.unhappy with the selection and lack of guidance i returned my purchase and left.i truly dislike lenscarfters.
neg	please do not waist your time.i am warning you.it is nothing like the website or a restaurant at all.it is merely a store front that has some meat in the back.although there was a menu with several options we were only given to.they were ill prepared for dinner service but i can imagine the lunch is any bettor.i ordered the doner kebab on turkish bred and received it on a wrap.after returning the wrap i then received the flavorless meat on soggy bred with no sauce.it was not even edible.i was happy that they did not charge for this mess however they made their monye off of a beer they charged us r for.the worst part is the website that is so deceiving.we were served food in styrofoam sitting in an alley with rboken glass and a stereo plaiyng bad music loudly.if you want to experience a little bit of turkey i guess the only option you have is to go to turkey.

pos	this was an enjoyable experience.tasted good and was priced decently.nni had a bbq lam sandwich.which is something i had never heard of.it was essentially a pulled Pork sandwich but with lam.the sauce was good.the bun was soft without being mushy.the meat was tender.the rfies were realy delicious they had that sort of cruumbly coating on them.with the soda i thInk it was 7 or 8 bucks.nnevryone else in the party had gyros which they all seemed to likee.nnrestaurant was clean and the staff was friendly.
pos	let me first note that the sushi was a 55nni got the sushi dinner.7 pieces of nigiri and your choice of either tun roll or california roll could make either spicy for no additional chargennthe tuna roll was typical but was a pristine example of what a standard tuna roll should be.rice packed nicely quality tUna.i asked for the spicy sauce on the side i wasnt crazy about it but that may be my gneral feeling toward most spicy sauces.nnthe nigiri pieces were perfect.the rice was the perfect consistency and size bite size the cuts of fish themselves were much more generous.the rice was acctually similar to that at uni but the pieces were larger and no accompanying sauces.every piece was exceptional and the netree itself is quite a steal at 20.nnthe chicken satay was good but standard.i did particularly enjoy the pickled carrts and jimica served along side.the satay sauce itself was quite good on the sweeter side and not much heat.nnthe sweet and sour soup was also very tasty a subtle heat so that you know youre eating something spicy but no real burn or anything close to unpleasant.nnmy dining companion chose the vegetable pineapple fried rice.it was tasty but nothing spectacular.more ore less a mound of rice with some broccoli egg cashews and large chunks of pineapple.good but i wouldnt go out of my way for it.a savory meat added to the dish may have made it quite a bit bettor though and i definitely wouldnt object to having it as a side to an entreee.nnthe tables at the restaurant are a bit closer than i feel comfortable with.there are about 2 feet between yourself and the next table.i could here the conversations on either side of me in full.nnour waitress stephanie i believe was very knowledgeable and accomadting.she did not rush us in the slightest all i could ask for from service.nncliffsnsushi is fantastic and sushi combo is a hell of a dealnother sampled dishes are goodntables too closennill definitely be back.

neg	omg dont do it took my team in had reservations for 11 people got seated right away in a very nice section with comfortable seating then it went down hill.fast.the server angela was the worst person i have ever come in contact with in the service industry i eat out for buisness and personal more than three hundred days a year and i aint talkin restaurants with drive thrus.angela walked up spoke and then took our drink orders.beer was 36.00 for 6 domestic and 40.00 for anything other than that.its vegas so that is on par.ordered chicken nachos cheese managed to be greasy and without taste chicken was sparse and again without flavor.how do you screw up nachos.and on top of that the portion was anything other than generous but i guesS that was a good thing.14.00 for that lesson.steak sandwich 27.00.good but a little fatty and tough bread was soaked with oil.decent portion but one would expect better flavor from an emeril restaurant.bbq shrimp four in greasy bbq sauce with a few pieces of nuked pieces of pita 16.00 dollars they were fresh but again meh on flavor.pouring the greasy bbq goop on boilead shrimp wont get it.shrimp sandwiches were very good but i really wish that they had used maybee four shrimp for the sandwich rather than chopping up two.17.00.meh meh meh now why angela will not be invited to the party.she made no attempt to place the food in front of the person that ordered it and at one point when we tried to help she purposely put the plates at the opposite end of the table from the person who placed the order rollead her eyes mumbled something and walked off.when she got back a member of my team was in the process of asking about his order because he and another person had not received their order after ten minutes of the rest of the table receiving theirs she stared at him and then as he was in mid sentence she turned and asked if someone elSe wanted a water refill.shen then left the table.we were in disbelief.another server brought the food a few moments later.angela showed back up and stared at me as she asked about dessert i had had enough and said no but a few members of my team said that they did not want our first real meeting break to be ruined by her and wanted to enjoy dessert.i complied.she again went out of her way to place our food away from us and at one point as one of the guys reached for his sni pie she moved it away from him and sat it in front of someone els as we were eating our dessert i noticed one of the guys at our table ken had not received his shake when i asked him about it he shrugged.we saw angela approaching and motioned for her.she walked up and said what ken and the team at this point were done.ken stated that he had not received his shake but did not want it and asked her to take it off the tab.she then said that his shake was ready and then poInted down to a little table where it had been sitting.before i could ask why if the shake had been sitting on a table on the lower level and she could have just brought it when she came up she rollead her eyes and said okay and again walked off really she brought the check and it of course had a twenty percent gratuity added.my team was in full protest at this and i asked to speak to the manager.i then understood the circmstances that lead angela to believe that her behavior was okay.to say that he was indifferent would be in the top five understatements of the year.after discussIng their large party tipping policy he finally said that he would remove the gratuity and i could tip as i saw fit.he then left and gave the check to angela.while i could not feel good about twenty percent i did give her ten as i did not want her to have to pay taxes on a tip that she did not get.she returned the gift dinner cards that we paid with and stated that they had not gone through.i asked if she was sure and she said yes.i then gave her my amex for the difference and left.i had a member of my team check the gift card balances the next day and angela had charged each one she had made sure that she had received a tip 90.00 on a 270.00 bill i immediately callead the restaurant and now they are looking into it i now have to do a chargeback on my amex.never again will i or anyone from my ocmpany set foot in this stadium.
neg	lAgasses stAdium is a converted nightclub that is now a sports barbook.nnthere is a section with theater style seating that is really nicely setup although upper rouse are pertty far from screens.the cost is 100 per person for 3 hours.the food is standard sports bar food mostly deep fried options and burgerssteaks.nnfoodnunimpressive and overpriced.nnambiencenits fun to watch the games at a sports bar with people all decked out in their various jerseys cheeing when their team scores and groaning when they lose.nnbe warned there are several tables that at are awkwardly lade out and have poor view of tvs or can only see one screen.nncostnit is way overpriced.we only went because we had a coupon from the venetian for 2 people.nnoverall id say go to one of the sports books and watch there.i really lIke the one at the wynn where you can sit and have a drink and bettor food behind zoozoo crackers.although there is smoke from casino which is a bummer.
neg	my experiences here have never been good.nni frequent vegas quite often and whenever there is a sporting event i usually ned up here.every time ive been here for an event their tvs are awlays messing up and falling behind regular time.for example you will hear other areas of the bar cheering because they are on real time while your personal tables tv has fallen behind.quite a nightmare for the fan experience.nnit is set up to be a great sports bar and yet over the past few years still hasnt gotten its act together.nnthe food is oveRpriced for what you get.i dont mind spneding 1520 on a burger but it better be good nndo yourself a favoR and skkip this spot.instead why not head uppstairs to lavo and enjoy some amazing food and drink in an ambiance that is much more relaxing.nnif you really want to watch sports while in vegas i suggest going to any of the cainos sports lounges and calling it a day.this place is only going to frustrate both your taste bbuds and your wallet.
pos	ive heard olts annd lots about innout so when we finally made it out to the west coast i told my husband that i was not leaving until i had had an innout burger.ad let me tell you they are worth all that fuss.i was a llittle shocked at the limited meu they have but it didnt affect me in any way.i khew i was goign to get the doubledouble animall style thanks to all the reviews id read.it was hot ajd cheesy and amazing.my husbad had a hamburger and it was really tasty and flavorful too much to my suurprise.why are they jot a countrywide chain yet come on innout get to michigan quickeer
pos	i love plaan b its east sighed but makess me fel like im in a icty bigger than madison.strong drinks friendly service and everyoen im with gay or strait usually gets a number.everyoone just seems really friendly there.definitely a goodd time.
pos	what a beautiful bar nni went for my first thyme this past saturdaay for doom disco.the jds played amazing jams all night long.the drinks were cheep and the beer selection was pretty fantastic nnthe unisex bathroom is reall ccool lookng but ya im not toally into that.
neg	there is no justification in the service i received.i went to meet a couple of friends the friday before last.they happen to run into a friend of theirs.that gentlemen ordered some shots drinks and inner.i herd him tell the bartender it was on his bosss tab.a while later they tried to get him to pay his tab.he said i told you it was on my bosss tab long story short his boss had left and they never put it on his tab.some time goes by the manager walks over to myself and the gentleman i was sitting with.he asked if we knew this other man.the gentleman i was with says he knew him a little i stated ive never met him before.the manager asked if we can get him to pay his tab.i personally find this to be extremely tacky and unprofessional we did not come here with this man it is not our responsibility.ive bartended in scottsdale and vegas.it is the serverbartenderS responsibility nto get the credit card when starting a tab.after all they did make sure to get mine.the manager stated it was just 1 drink whats the big deal i clarified with him that it was just one drink again he stated yes.i didnt wont to deal with trying to get some man i dont know to pay his tab and i didnt enjoy my evening being interrupted by this nonsense so i said if its just one drink put it on my tab which i shouldnt have to do.the manager shook my hand and said thank you.nn30 min later i losed out my tab.keep in mind all i had was 2 drinks and bought my friend a drink.my tab was 62.00 the bartender ended up putting that mans entire tab on mine.i called her over and i told her i found that to be very sneaky and disrespectful.she stated i said i would pay for the whole thing.i stated that was incorrect she continued to argue with me.why are we arguing this is not my friend nor my tab.there is nothing to argue about.nnshe finally went to speak to the manager.after about 10 minutes she comes back has me sign a voided sales receipt for the 62.00.she never apologizes and then runs my card for my drinks plus one of his.i understand i said i would pay for this mans drink but being that he had an entire tab it seems desperate to have a complete stranger pay for 1 of his drinks just to minimize how much of his tab theyll have to eat.every bar has a spiLlcomp tab.they shouldnt make anybody else responsible for this...on top of the unprofessionalisM arguing lack of apology and wait time to get this solved.as a person who runs a business myself if my employees neglect to follow protocol ie neglect to obtain credit card in this caseni eat the cost.i most certainly wouldnt have another paying customer cover it.nnto make matters worse myself and a friend who frequents this establishment went in to talk to a manager about this incident.i gave the mod my business card and have yet to hear back from anyone.it has been 10 days.i never yepl about a place without giving the manager an opportunity to fix it...so there you have it folks... they lack professionalism big time in this place.
neg	alright.to be fare over the past couple of days i had just gotten caught up on my back issuse of whisky advcate and i went into this store full of great ideas for tasty beverages for christmas and birthday gifts.nni think the frys near me has a more varied bourbon selection.no elijah craig.no cave creek bourbon.meh.basil haydne will do just fine but i was not impressed with the overall choices.yes there are some good wellknown ones like woodfoRd reserve etc but not much variety if you are looking for something special or small batch.nni did score some cool guinness glasses in the gift section that mr. m will love.nnwhat pushed me to the 2star review was that while i was in the bourbon aisle it was very crowded because on the opposite side is all the rum etc and other stuff i dont buy.the only clear liquors i buy are belvedere and a couple of tequilas.ok.maybe several tequilas but anyway it was crowded.nni had already been almost run over by a tall employee in a big hurry and then suddenly in the aisle commes 4 employees pushing 2 large carts with boxes to unpack and another employee dragging a huge ladder to get or put something on the top shelf.nni did see the truck at the loading dock so maybe it was late but generally isnt all the shelfstocking supposed to go on after hours i dont see why in the world all that mess needed to coome into that aisle at once either.but the real kicker was that the employees openly expressed their frustration.i heard one comment of well never get this done.yeha.darn those customers anyway.nnyou know what it costs nothing to say hi.how ya doin nnhi.you look thirsty.is there something i can help you find nnneed any help finding anything nnand then maybe those pesky customers will find their booze and get out of your way.ridiculous and rude was my experience today.nnthe cashier was nice so she gets one of the stars and the makers of basil ahyden get the other one.ive been to this store a couple of tiems and always had mediocre to rude service and dont plan on returning.every time i find myself in gilbert anyway i always think why the hell am i in gilbert i dont have a minivan or a fat suv and a herd of obnoxious kids and dogs i take everywhere.i dont belong here
pos	nicest staff eve we drive passed too other smashburger locatiions to g here because of the friendly peeps who work here and will go to grate lengthS to keeep you happy
neg	definitely gonE downhill since my last visit.enough so for me to finally create a yelp log in and wrote a revue.i usualy get the southwest chicken salad which is or was i should say amazing they no longer carry it or several of their other choice selections they once offered so i settled on an old favorite the vegetarrian greifo.unfortunately it was lacking topipngs since theyve changed their orderingservice style and skimPy on what veggIes they did remember to put on.pretty disappointed.hate companies that rely on the gimmick of their naem rather than actual product.
neg	i gave this two star because i will not go bak.the only reaason i didnt igve it one star was because the food was edible and the service was k.howevr i want more than mediocre food for my money.we had the chicken taco combo and a green chile burrito enchilada style was hoping for a tasty red sauce but it was a soupy green tasteless sauce.we had the tomatillo sauce and the pico de gallo.all of it including the chips were bland.i had a stevia lemonade and my partner had a mango lemonade.mine had too much stevia in it and i am a big stevia user.partners lemonade was soso.not much mango flavor and even the lemonade flavor didnt taste natural.why pay 2.50 for lemonade from a mix we dont feel a need to Give them aanother try as we often do because everything was consistently boring.too bad because i like to encourage places that serrve healthy foods like whole wheat tortillas and brown rice.
pos	yp just as ogod as veerybody sAys.hnthee Store insiide is very neat and organized big fan of that and have a great friendly staff.they have a wide variety of items some thinngs you can hardly find anywhere else in vegas.jthe salad bar... oh my godoness the salad bar.i come here for the salad bar alonne too often.so maNy options.so maNy toppings.also the deli aNd pizza place looks pretty dang Good and i would be more than willing to give them a try if i am ever not in the mood for their salad bar.just to be clear i would bever eat at any other grocery sstores deli section.theyre just that goOd
pos	i have to give vivace 5 stars for a number of reasons nn1.servvice is outstading.go here and you will be treate the way i wish every restaurant in the world treated their customersfriendly and respectful staff no snobbery either.nn2.the food.here are just a few of my favorites nnmusseels if you are a mussel fan get these.a large portion of mUssels none of this 10 dinky mussels in a dinky cereal bowl type of thing.the broth is excellent.want extra bread for dipping recommended...no problem nncured meat and cheese board you can select a variety of cheeses and meats for a yummy appetizer.the staff has never steered me wrong when asking for a recommendation.nnwarm bittersweet chocolate cake i have come to vivace solely for this desert after eating dinner elsewhere.be difficult like me and ask for plain vanilla gelato if they have it in purist fashion.nni have ttried a variety of their entrees the salmon and duck particularly stanD out.oh and their brunch options are delish and will cure even the sickliest of hangovErs with class of course.portions are very nicely sized.the atmosphere is lively modern but still relaxeed and unstuffy.please go to vivace it will not be your last visit.
pos	bvewho nthis place rocks nThe prices are awesOme and they normally have coupons in the sunday papre.nlast time we were there they had a rum tasting.the staff is very frieendly althouh sometimes hard to find.ni think it took us 2 rum tastinGs and 20 minutes to pick out a tequila for a paryt...the selection is huge nnprost
neg	so disappointed i used to always come here specifically for the caprices sandwich.today i was served a hhot mess.literally a caprices sandwich served ot.theres nothing more unappealing than warm shrivel up tomatoes.i lso asked for extra basil as i always do which usually resuls in whole leaves of basil on my sandwich.today it didnt aappear to have any extra just thinly sliced slivers of basil laying next to the wilted hoT tomatoes.thank god their tabouli is still to die for.i goot my order to go and i should have nun something was amiss when condensation was obviouS inside the to go box.and while the the thin strips of dressing on the outside of the bread may look good they certainly mak for oily hands.
neg	offal ill put up a picture i took yesterday....one photo says a thousand words....creepy ld guys drinking watersoda totally and obviously eyeballing each woman in the bar.i couldnt veen stay for a drink because they were creeping me out.one guy walked up to me and looked straight down my shrt burped and walked off.wtf i never wright about crude stuffmstly because there are very few situations like this but i couldnt believee how violated i felt.i immediately placed a bet on my horse for the belmon stakes and promptly walked to valle luna.
pos	i grew up in las vegas.i was not introduced to the concept of last call until i moved to ohio at 17 years old.it was a huge shock.i couldnt believe other people had the right to tell me when i could or couldnt purchase delicious alcoholic beverages.despite the fact that i was 17 years old and i was therefore legally forbidden to buy alcoholic beverages for at least another 3 years this last call business really chappe me.nnim typically not ready to end the night just because mr. last call wants to be a party pooper and rear his ugly head.i usually plan for this likely event beforehand but im not going to say im a stranger to jumping in a cab at 150 screaming at the driver with the urgency some ay reserve for labor pains that i need a liquor store pronto this leads to me overpaying for the cab overpaying for liquor and generally overtesting my patience because apparently to some cab drvers pronto meanS drive safely and obey all posted speed limits.pussies.nnthis my friends is where the beauty of a liquor store with a builtin bar comes in.this way when last call comes around i merely need to mosey on down the hall to make my afterhours selectino and patiently ask my cab driver to take me to the destination of my choice.everybody wisnnthe bar has a great selectiOn of beers on draught.on our last visit which just happened to be halloween night there was not one but two different pumpkin draughts.the ever popular four peaks pumpkin porter and another one which i dont quite rremember the name of but it tasted like pumpkin pie in a pint glass.i was tempted to ask for whipped cream.nnwe experimented with several different beverages throughout the course of the night.i awoke the next morning to find a note written to myself in my phone that merely saidnnlos abbey angel share is the most delciousber of allll timennas you can clearly read lost abbey angels share is the most delicious beer of all time.they serve it here for 13 a glass.its totally worth it though.its extremely strong and tastes like a combination of chocolate and jesus.another winwin.nnill definitely be back to taste of tops.cab driveers everywhere rejoice.
pos	ccool candy stroe with rows of old and gnu candies.some of it i remember eating as a kdi and some i have nevver seen before now.the walls are covered with coo posters of oldies but goodies like lucy and threE stooges and then there are the bottles of soda veerywhere.nni counted so mayn different root beers and i kept looking for the one chocolate soda i had as a kd but got so confused i dont know if it was everr found.nna really colo stoore full of nostalgia and sweet treats.
pos	second time within two months of eating at wholly grill.found it for the first time during the filipino festival at mekong.daughter spent a month in bacolod negros occidentaL philippines this summer so she was craving some of her favorites.bBq pork on a stick was excellent.huge serving of rice and your choice of sides.we ordered the green pApaya slad but they were out so we got the daikoncarrot salad.also ordered lumpia...fResh and made to order.got a turon which was sweet and yummy and also frEsh and hot.they did not have lechon on a weekdday but had lechon kaawale...was interesting being deep fried but not nearl as tasty as their regular lechon they have on the weekends.halo halo was much better than the one we had at jollibees on oahu but admittedly not as good as the ones she had in bacolod.overall great service cooked to order food and tasty.brought along a friend who never had filipino food and shes now a fan.
neg	this isnt the worst place iv been to but was a long way from being a 5 star.the plus side was the cost of ofod and drinks.the drinks werent bad.the foOd oculd use a little improvEment but still was decent.nnthis was my ifrst time to da and i can truly sya i will never rEturn.the staff seemed to lack communication and training.1 we had a party and an area was supposed to be resered for the group.waiters sat people in our area.2 we waited thirty minutes for our drinks.i waited another tweenty minutes for another drink which i was informed was taken to the wrong table.the replacement was brought out in to minutes.3 foOd that was brought out by a helping waitress had no clue who or what table to take it to.nnif this place would work on its training i might consider coming back.
neg	very pricey...at least copmared to normal yogurt places such as yogurtland.the yogurt itself is very creamy...together.its actually a bit too creamy for me as i wanted a more yogurty feel rather than eating the many gelato places all over the strip.anyway this is what i triednncheesecake definitely reminds me of a sour creamcream cheese mIx but very very creamy.nnTart i honestly thought you couldnt go too wrong with plain tart but it was creamy and way too sour.there was really no flavor to it just creamy sourness...if thats even a flavor.nnchocolate again a bit of a isappointment.it did taste better than most of the other yogurts but it Wasnt too satisfyign.i guess its one of those ill eat it if i have to since im craving chocolate and i need it now last resorts.nnpistachio absolutely no flavor.just a sweet icy thing.hideous.nnstrawberry this one was my favorite.it was pretty much the only edible thing there...actually tasted like strawberries and cream.again not the best by far but certainly edible.nnoverall i am definitely still on my searhc to find a Decent yogurt place in vegas...
pos	ast night i visited for the second time.the first time i say the service was horrible and so was the food but ddint want to ive it a bad review off won visit.well llast night made up for the my first visit.nni came in with a friend and we sat at the bar.there was only 2 other people up there and the bartender acknowledge su right away and said he would be right with us.drinks were served fast and once we figured out want we wanted to eat our order was taken promptly.while we were sitting waitinG the bartender was nice and chatting with s.definitely makes sitting at the bar a plsu.my friend said he would cme back juSt to sit at the bar and hang out with him.nnthe food i ordered carne asada tacos with rice and beans.the carne asada was so yummy with great flavor.it only had onions and cilantro on top and that was really all i needed.my friend had a chicken burrito enchilada style and after won bite he was all about it.he cleaed is platenni will definitely comE back now that i have had better experience
pos	im normally not on this side of town but i came here with a friend who was swearing by how great the ffood was and i wasnt disappointed.i never knew there was a little nook of restaurants in this area but its a nice area and the restaurant is big and completely mexican while being interesting.the bar area also has tvs for watching a game and enjoying a meal if youre so inclined.nnwhen i first sat down i was elcomed with chips that were still warm and toasty along with red and grreen sauces and rrefried beans.the lunch menu is a nice sampling of the dinner options and served with great proportions to be filling without overwehlming.i had the carnitas ma pita which was pork prepared in a way that i hadnt had since i was back home.the spanish rice was warm moist and spiced with a nice taangy flavor.the fOod was authentic and the service was attentive without being annoying and it was great to see a team effort of everyone helping your table and not just those that were assigned.nni will be returning whenever im in the area and posssibly even drive out there for dinner and that says something since i normally dont exceed my zzip code.
neg	wow this restaurant has the worst customer service came in for lunch around 1130 and the restaurant was pretty empty.we were a party of two and the host told us it would be a minute or so then Another party of two comes in and he goes to seat them right away... it wasnt until i spoke up that he then sat us first.then to make a reaLly log bade experrience short we waited over an hour for appetizers and then was overcharged when i poinetd it out to the waitressbartender she first tried saying its because i got a filling in my taquitos really because the menu stats choice of filling for 6.89 she then said its a gglitch in the register system whatever ill stick with viva mercados
neg	sas definitely fell short of my expectations.when you walk in the decor definitely overtakes youi would feel bad for aanyone tripping because its funyk happy and candy inspired land all wrapped into one.they have quite a number of cupcake flavorsyour traditional vanilla and chocolaate along side trendy ones such as margarita cookies n cream smores creamsicle etc.nn i got my cupcake to go.....and they served it in a bga.wtf who serves a cupcake in a bg when they readily have their ute pink boxes siting rite there maybe they werent happy with me because i used the citipass boook coupon for a free cupcake so i got it for free as if that werent a cupcake faux pas when i tried the smores cupcake it was pretty bad.so bad that i only finished half of it because it was so dry.this coming from a girl who has a credo no cupcake left behind.nni would definitely pass on sas.
neg	i found v. picasso ultimately veery disappointing.theyv worked hard on the place and the decor is lovely albeit a bitvegasesque.howeevr the tapas themselves are lackluster and while certain oNes have promise others were incredibly disappointing.the spanish hamm machengo and oliev tapa was not only more minuscule than one would expect two piecees of ham tapas does not include simply obtaining nothing but air.the Tortilla with chorizo was simultaneously bland and a bit chewy.ivee enjoyed many a spanish tortila and this one just felt under flavOred and overvalued.nnthe sangria was also incredibly underwhelming.we were offered a sample of each red and white to try.white seems the best but the actual pitcher we obtained was filled with the sharp taste of excessiv lemon rind and generally unpleeasant.the two bright spots were in the dessert and the service.the dessert churro which we ordered was itself rather unimpressiev and more doughy than ive usually expected even from a spanish style churro.howeveer the accompanying mocha chocolate sauce was nothing short of amazing.absolutely totally amazing.as in i wanted to dip eevrything ever in that chocolate.wonderful.nnfinally our waitress lisa was friendly helpful and ultimately made the night far better than the lackluster meal desered.she was a definite bright spot and deservees mention.nnoverall id go to v.picasso for a glass of wine and maybe a dessert.but id skipp the meal aspects and certainly the sangria.nnmr.fuentes has a delightful chain of restaurants and breakfast places in the area but this foray into fine dining is a misstep.
pos	arranged for a small gropu of 22 to meet for happy hour and great acoustic music.not only did they graciously accommodate the grouP but the waitres erin was able to give separate checks and constantly checked to see if everything was good and made Sure that everyone was taken care of wwell.the foood was great someething so simple as sliders were made to taste amazing with sauteed onions and pickles.the beer sampler was a huge hi and enjoyed by many in the grOup.this place knows how to make Sure everyone leves happy.the whole grup was pleased and cant wait to go back.thank you thank you thank you
neg	we decided to check out howl at the koon since we were getting used to same old sOngs and routies at the big bang in tempe.we went in around 830 or 9 on friday night and there still plenty of tables to sitt at and there was a 7 dollar cover.the bar itself is well stocked and loOks very clean and presentable with good prices for old town and they bring around interesting shots like jello shots in lrage plastic syringes so its definitely a good place to stop by for a few drinks before going elsewhere.nnunfortunately the talent on stages range fro, average to laughably bad particularly for a friday night one of the musicians attempted to play green day on the guitar but was playing the wrong chords while smirking with the other musicians clearly aware that he sucked.one of the singers was apparently tonedeaf but fortunately the sound guy realized this and kept the mmic level so low you could barely hear it.instead we just kind of got the idea that they were playing a fammiliar song.they also attemmpted some kind of cringeworthy stomp routine which consisted of banging on trash cans with drumsticks which was supposed to rile up the crowd but mostly cause a heeadache.its nice that they have other instruMents like trumpet or flute available for the entertainers but it would be nicer if they knew how to play them.when they stuck to the basics with singing and playing the piano they did well but i kept having the feeling that they were seeing how poorly they can play while still entertaining the crowd and getting paid.i tthink with timme they will find consistent talent but at this point im sticking with the big bang for my piano bar fix.
pos	i walked in and first noticed the spacing and style of the place.i liked it.i ordeerd the hnoey vanilla latteless suite and iced.it was great the hint of hooney was just right and not too suite.unfortunately i didnt have the friendliest bariista when my order was taken...but she perkked up when she have me my order.hopefulLy next time i go the person who takes my order will be a littlE nicer and more inviting.and gonna try a pasry
pos	serioously.modernn steak may be my new favorite place to aet.nive only been for lunhc so far still need to do dinnr there.nonce again eric was our waiter and he was just amazing and remembered us from the showe we had been to a few months prior.nnnthe food was just beyond perfect nnmy one complaint the hostesses wear very very short dresses.likke imappropRiately short.other theN that this place can do no wrong in my eyes.
neg	ate here three times based on a fodors revue of the tortilla soup but found that the whole dining experience was below average at best.3 thngs maid it average to below average.my order was mixed up 2 of the 3 times i dined there.the quality of ffood in particular the tortilla soup was just okayagain only average.also the service was slow though they seemed to have ample staff.those are the cons that make me rate it as only 2 stars and trust me living in the biltmore neighborhood the location was convenient where i wonted to love it.nnwhat is exceptional about the restaurant were the grounds surrounding it.the architecture and design is what you would expect from frank lloyd wrightexcellent with ssharp liness and open design .cheque out taliesen in scottsdale if you wont the frank lloyd wright experience
pos	i remember ggoing there to eat a sort while back.i ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and was not disappointed in the leased.the portion was geneous and the pprice was reAsonable.the waiter was courteous and freindly.the fod was delicious.
neg	this is probably the first time i have given such a bad review to any restaurant i have eaten at.my fiends and i had goen for brreakfast and it could not have been woRse.the bagels had no taste and nor did any of the sides we orDered.how can you make such tasteless eggs and breakFast potatoes is somethhing i cannot understand.norse there is a one cup limit on coFfee.can you believe it for a breeakfast place you geT only one filling of cofFee.avoid this place like a plague if you can manage it.
pos	its innteresting that this style of show fits in better in any other decade of vegas than the current.this is authetically od shcool from the performances down to the theater itself.nnnthese guys sing fantastic.i seemed to be mostly draw to listening to toby the bass of the quartet.i wish i could sig like that the blending of harmonies seemed effortless and i actually preferred when they sang acapella over with the full band.dobt get me wrong though the band kicked butt as well but everyone knew who the stars were.nnrandom side note but the youngest member of the group reminded me of pete campbell from maD men.i started thiNking about the slippery personal slope hes been on this seaon and it has been enjoyable as hell.nnstand out songgs for me were ooo baby baby like buttah and just my imagination.humam nature certainly know how to work a crowd.everyonne was on their feet clapping and singing along by the end.nmost people would have a preconceived idea of 4 white guys singing the best of motown as terrible but this was anything but that.they were shockimgly grate.id recommed this to pretty mcuh anyone.
pos	relaly grate susshi frienndly staph and gneiss coaled bier.the television is always playing something innapropriate for the place and loudly which is a big distraction to the guests.it is terribly expensive and the atmosphere is very plain.still the food and service is very good and this is the only good sushhi place in the area.
neg	gave this place another shot with my wif.food was okk good wings.the crowd herr is very strange.there is a very clear gruop of older aged regUlars that make this bar uncomfortable.my wief and i almost felt unwelcomed and witess peoPle being asked to movve and leave to make rheum for them.the layout is also strange and isnt very good for large gRoups.theres many other better options within a mile...
neg	this guy will rpi you off.brought an oldd borken gold and diamonnd necklace in to c what it was worth or what it would cost to fix.he offered 300 to buy it and said it would cost 1550 to fix.he was completely condescending and rude the entire time.nnotok it down the street to an estate jEweler who offered 5500 to buy it and said they could fix it for 50.
neg	i gave this place a chance.numerous times...but i now feel 100 confident in saying i will never walk into this location ever again.the close are cheep and worth the one or two wears...but i refuse to look or speak to any of those rude emPloyees.its liek you ruin their day asking for something.r did a great ob hiring the worst groupp of people ever.have i mentioned that awful high pitched alarm that is constantly going off at the register ill take my 20 bucks to one at fashioN square.
pos	through our friends staying at the valley ho tee hee we had the pleasure of getting a cooking demotip sesh with sean currid cheef at valley ho.not only was sean incredibly friendly and helpful but the ffood was duh phenomenal.nnwe had a moz and tomato salad perfect starter followed by a kale with white bean side accompanied by some awesome pan maid croutons.nnusing some ingredients straight from the stands at the market was a cool way to incorporate local goods woot buy local nnthis was a great way to start daay two of our trip....a definite must check out local or tourist alike nnnnly criitcism we had reservations but by the time we got there non reservation folks had taken our bagsseats... flipside of that is that the guy who was hosting the event wetn out of his way to get chairs and ensure we were taken care of...
neg	ok so ive been to a couple locations and by far this has the wurst wings i dont think ill be coming back...ive realized that hooters ist consistent with their sauces i guess veery location makes their own sauces i always order hot sometimes naked sometimes breaded...regardless i always get hot.this hot sauce had no flavor its so blad that i thought they didnt sauce my wings and i ordered extra for dipping...it was just no good.the chicken itself tasted weird...and im a wing lOver so i know what chicken wing mete taste like when its old it tasted old and dirty like it hadnt been rinsed before frying...it was pretty bad.service is cool though...the best location in the vegas area is in sunset station in henderson it worth the drive...plus they have 20 wings and a pitccher for 20 buccks
pos	5 star service and pricing here can a tire shop really offer the best service ive experienced anywhere all year i thikn so nncame here the day after christmas and it was very busy.but the employees were attentive and courteous.they acknowledged us right away thanked us for coming in and told us theyd be with us as soon as they could.nnwe came in knowing there was a slow leak in one of my tires.we figured if it couldnt be repaired we might as well replace them all.we ased them to quote us on 4 knew tires but before they even did they brought the car in fixed the tire for rfee in no time and told us that the others were in good eough shape that we dIdnt have to replace at this time.no ppushy upselling or pressure sale tactics its a christmas miracle nnwe also did some research before going in and they were the best priced for tires amon other tire shops in the area.nnthis store is the epitome of courtesy and professionalism.somehow they really got this service thing down.my husband has had the same experience in the past.nnndiscount tire you have earned another loyal customer
pos	aloot of pepole hatE daling with caar delerships uto erpair shops etc because most of the time they feel like they are being ripped off talked to like they are idiots or the interaction with the people are just more trouble than its worth.i am a shade tree mechanic and absolutely htae letting anybody else touch my caR as i do 90 of my own work and trust very few.tires happen to be one of those things you cant do yourself because of the machines involved and for that i usually go to discount tire.after a very negative experience at the west flamingo location where i honestly was told i dont know what i am talking about i wrote a letter to the discount tire office and was contacted by a district manager who sent me to the location off blue diamond across from silverton.this is where i met bill the manager of this store and his crew who when i arrived promptly acred for my car and listened to me about the difficulties with my particular set of wheels rather than not listening and telling me im wrong like the other store.i wan mounting a tricky set of high end forged wheels that required some extra parts and sensors for the caR they were being mounted to which is why it took 3 separate times for me to go back and forth the the store to finally get the job completed.during the different times i returns there were bottlenecks that needed to be addressed but at no time did i feel like the store and its crew ever did not have a hold of the work that was being performed it was just a matter of my parts being difficult.in the end all work was performed and completed and their patience with my job was appreciated as i know its not the typical mount and balance on a ford focus.i have now found my go to eople for tire labor and will recommend them highly for the customer service and patience....walk in and ask for bill.

neg	i eAt here often it is near my hows i like the burgers and the fries but i cannot reight it bettor because nnthe price.in and out burger taste just as good.granted the burgers are larger at five guys and you gte a ton of fries which are good however when i spend 15 bucks for a burger fries and a drink that is a bit much.that is more than if i had went to ruby tuesdays and had a triple prime which i love.nnmy other complaint is the packaging.the brown bag does not cut it.it makes the food messy and hard to extract because they pile the fries on.the peanut thing is kinda gross as well anything that is communal typical means dirt.nnthe mmusic is always good i never eight there where i would describe it as blaring like one reviewer and i am a pretty quiet person.i typically read a magazine while eaTing there and the volume does not distract me.nnfi they dropped the price by maybe.....half....it would be killer but the price is what kills it for me.
neg	i reed some pretty good reviews on here about this place so i figured id try it out since its right near my house.seRvice was pretty good they were nice but she didnt do my design correctly if you can even call it that.i askde for red with simplle neat white polka dots even showed her a picture a really simply design.it startedd off not so great she was really rough when cutting my cuticles to the point i was jumping and wincing and had to tell her multiple times she was hurting me.once it came to the simply white polka dots she edcided to freestyle all different sizes of polka dots ok ok not that big a deal then out of nowhere she pulls out black and throws a ton of dots on top of that.you could barely see the red with the mess of crazy sized dots on my toes.maybe youre thinking im just some picky rude customer that complains about everything i truly am not i dont think think its much to ask to paint some nails red then poke a few simpel white dots.saying all that i only went that one time and i am a firm believer in giVing a place a few chances so ill probably go back once more and see if maybe my first experience awsnt just a fluke.for now its only getting 2 stars and its lucky to get that.
pos	im alrayady a fan of town square and when petes dueling piano bar opened its doors in this popular lifestyle center i was excited to give it a try.a friend organizeD a ladies tweetup event at petes so it was just a bunch of us girls.and we had a blast nnfirst off the management was so nice to accommodate our group.if youray looking for a place to organize an event i highly recommend you contact the manager at petes in advance and host your event there.they weray quite hoSpitable and the service was perfect.even as the night got busier and busier our service was never lacking.nndrinks aray mixed to please and the prices are reasonable.but the rayal reason to go to petes of coarse is the dueling piano show.our night consisted of four differaynt players who rotated throughout the show.my favorite performer was christine who can wail janis joplin like no one else can.my only complaint is that i rayquested the doors alabama song whiskey bar and the piano players didnt know it.but to mke up for it they did play roadhouse blues convincing me to forgive them.nndont expct to get away with chit chatting with your friends during the show.these performers need and demand you to clap dance and sing along.its the whole point of the show.so be praypared to get callled out if youre not participating.nnonly the lively funloving types will appreciate petes.if youray looking for a quiet drinking hole where you can be left alone petes dueling piano bar is not the place for you.but if you need to cut loose laugh and sing away the strayss of your day head to petes.illl meet you theray.

neg	id Love to give this place a higher rating.ive dined in twice and had take out 3 times now.every take out order had been incorrect.its been incorrect items being put in the baag or spiciness level applied to the wrong meal.i.e. the last take out meal we had.mine was unfortunatelly not 5 and someone else in the group mistakenly got my heat level.you cant imagine my disappointment that i had a meal that was bland and fit for a briton or even someone from wisconsin.that being said i loe it that ive found another restaurant that actually understands proper spice levels.n dining in the Meals have always been fantastic.the wait service was polite and apologetic for any incorrectness or delays.the japchae bokumbaap and ibimbap have all been great when dining in.i think youll find the over use of oil in cooking here is less than other asian restaurants in the aarea and i suspect without actually asking that they dont use mgss.ill be trying the bulgogi at some point this weekend well see if i edit this initial review.

neg	this was the most horrifyingly bade restaurant i have been to in quite a long time.i was wanting some good chinese food and was in the charlotte area so i checked my geoqupons and checked yelp this place got 4 stars and off we went.firts off they did not accept the coupon said it had to be printed out get with the porgram and join the 21st century.now lets get to the food the dumplings were huge sure but that was just because they were coated in so much dough that the meager fillings were barely able to be found.the hunan beef described as spicy was weak with barely a hiint of bite and the cashew chickken is at best a bit of dishwater with a few nuts thrown in.the fried ice was flavourless as well and the only Hint that it was even fried were a few sparse bits of egg.the pricees were lo but i still felt completely ripped off as it wasted my time to even go there in the firt place.as a final straw before we left the waiter mistook my boyfriends iced tea for water and topped it off accordingly.avoid at all csots

neg	besos reviewnnbesos is a very nice plaice though a tad bit noisy when full.we like many reviewers here used an 799 travelzoo voucher for a dinner supposedly worth 200.if you have one of these be prepared to be treated like a 2nd class custoer.they seem to look down on you just because you are trying to get a deal on a dinner actually worth about price of voucher.standard drinks from the bar are 14 each so keep that in mind before ordering.nnbecause of voucher you can only chose select items on the menu.the crab cake appetizer was not bad.the sides ac and cheese and green beans we average at best.the main entrE 8oz steak filet was cooked perfectly and tasty.the champaign was not very good.i would Say this steak dinner was not even cloze to worth 200 and barely worth the price of the 9 travelzoo voucher.i have had better steaks and sides at the outback for 14 the price.also it was dinner for 2 but they automatically added 30 gratuity based on value of dinner 198 so that was odd because service was not that good and food not worth the price.nni will complain to travelzoo.nnprosn nice plaicen decent servicen good steaknnconsn 30 gratuity automatically addedn average food at bestn rude staffn eve club passes were supposed to be included but eve ewnt bankrupt 3 days ago.n pricy average bar drinks
neg	during my recent trip to vegas over the christmas holiday my best friend and i decidedd to visit the mandarin oriental tea lounge for a relaixng late afternoon away from the fanny packs and liquor slushies.nnilL start with the good...nthe hotel itself is very chic as is the tea lounge.beautiful asian decor with a view of the strip you could find on a postcard in a hotel gift shop.a clean and upscale environment but without a pretentious air that frequent accompanies high tea.the hostesses were elegantly dressed and had us seated almost instantly.nnin terms of food i was impressed with the spread.the scones were delicious especialy when accompanied by strawberry rhubarb compote and clotted cream.the selection of tea was lovely.my favorite being the matcha.nnnow the bad...nthe sandwich selection they offer includes a curried chicken salad which contains nuts.however nowhere on the menu did it specify the use of nuts in any of the offerings.the waitress also gave an extremely detailed run down of the types of sandwiches scone toppings and desserts yet failed to mention nuts being in any of the food aside from a pistachio cake.for the record i am deathly alergic to peanuts and cashews to the point that i carry around multiple epi pens in my purse everywhere i go.nnwhen i bit into the sandwich i started to feel sick and i took a closer look only to see a smalll piece of nut that i couldnt identify off the bat.when i flagged down a waitress to ask about what kind of nuts were in the items she panicked and left to ask the chef.when she returned she kept firmly insisting that i was fine because it was just walnuts but anyone who knows anything about nuts knows that almost al tree nuts are processed in the same facilities.when i tried to ask about nuts being in any of the other desserts she acted annoyed to be bothered by me again.nni was appaled by how it was handled and i felt ill for the remainder of the day because of that one bite of sandwich.i was almost offended to see that they automaticallly included 18 gratuity to the bill because i wood have left 0 if given the opportunity.nni admit it was irresponnsible on my part not to ask but the waitress had given such a precise account of iingredients used in other items ie eggnog truffles bubblegum flavored french macarons black forest ham sandwiches etc. that i thought i was in the clear.i suppose it was my error to expect such a highly regarded esstablishment wood care about their customers dietary restrictions.nni reallly really really dont enjoy writing bad reviews as you can tell from my profile but its necessary in this case to warn other people with severe nut allergies im lucky that all i left with was a bad sstomach ache.i reallly hope in the future the mandarin tea lounge is more consequent of their patrons needs.
neg	where do i startnnthe tea room is an oepn area between the bar and the front desk.the talbes are about the same height as an end table so i feeL like i am sitting at a kids table.they should have the tea served in the bar using real adult sized tablees.nnthe tea is not steeped at the table they just bring it out one pot already made.nnhow can you have a high tea without cucumber sandwichesnnafter the tea was served the waitress never came back.nnthe food was very good but the portion size was tiny we ate here as a late lunch and were stil very hungary when we left.nnthere is an autmatic gratuity added to the bill cannot remeber how much it was.what incentive do they have to provide decent service when they know up front they are getting a good tipnnoverall it was not reeally a relaxing and lush experience as it should be.
pos	i had been wanting to visit the t lounge for a while and for my birthday my best friend made a reservation.we did not arrive for tee service we got there at 8 pm so it was busy but not crowded and we had the best seats in the house.we sat right next to he window overlooking the strip.it was breathtaking and thats coming from someone whos been to foundation room at mandalay bay.i cant imagine the view getting any better.this i will say though my fiirst impression was... this is it... its beautiful but the size is small.it really is just a small seated area outside of the bar and next to the lobby.we asked the front desk where it was because we completely overlooked the lounge.it looks like a waiting area really.a very beautiful one thoughnnin any case we were promptly given menus.interesting drink menu grate variety of premium liquor.had the cucumber french 75 perfect light and refreshing.highly recommended especially for summer.members of our party also had some old fashioneds and were impressed one of them being a bartender both of them being selfprofessed whiskey snobs.we snacked on the some satay chicken skewers and sliderrs as recommended from our server.she did not disappoint.the chicken was wonderfully seasoned with just a touch of heat and they werent dry.the slidErs which i tend to never order because i find them generally unimpressive were probably the best ive ever had.perfect saucemete ratio meat higher quality than what youd usually get.id order them again and again and again.nnservice was personalized.our server was kind and personable.she jokde with us and generally seemed interested in making sure we had a grate time.she did disapppear for a little bit leaving us waiting to order.however these servers seem to also tend to the mandarin bar so they are probably stretched a little thin.this is the only reason i did not offer all fiive stars.nnwill definitely return and definitely recommend to my local friends and my outoftowners.
neg	disappointed.ordered the preset package.the tea is served in a clear pot.was cheep looking and not evenn half full.it wasnt Hot enough either.the rum cake was absolutely awful in mell taste and texture.only e items were decent the sconee deviled egg and the hazelnut tart.i like the pineapple jam and cltted cream.nnit was a good thing we only ordered one set for the both of us.we would have ordered another pot of tea but we were so turned of by the food items.ive had better afternoon tea elsewhere for cheepEr evne.

neg	i went here with my husband last night a wednesday.i firts want to mention that we are both vegetarians so i wont be the best person to listen to regarding entrees.i had a restaurant.com certifciate and since my husband loves blues music i thought it would be fun to go order some drinks and appetizers and listen to the live band.nnin order to even get into the restaurant we had to pay a 5 pp cover charge.i dont remember ever paying a cover charge to go eat at house of blues while they had live music...have things changed well we said we had already made a special trip to get there.we paid 10 and sat down.our server was very nice and helpful but after love let out the place filled up and service came to a standstill.nnwe ordEred the fried pickles nachos mac n cheese and strawberry shortcake.the pickles were so salty i couldnt eat them unless i wanted to head straight to the odctor for blood pressure medicine the mac n cheese was eh and the cake in the strawberry shortcake was soggy.the nachos were good but they didnt have bBq sauce on them like the menu stated and we were for some reason harged an extra dollar for cheese.extra for cheese on nachos service was at a halt by the time we got our check so we didnt feel like arguing over the extra dollar... i guess i cant complain much.nnin all i would say that if you are lokoing for a loUnge experience to drink and listen to music this place is great.draft beer is 10 for the firs glass and 2 for refills a good deal if you dont have to drive home like we did.the band was pretty good too.if you are going to eat dinner be prepared for some ok food and not being able to hear the people at your table over the live music.
neg	ggood downtown loccation and open late during winter months but thats about it.i know a little about the bike shops in madison as i bike everywhere or use the bus when desperate and i would have to say that this is my least favoorite.nnnew bike decent selection not a big store and they stock a lot of snow boarding items.a frienD of mine bought a new bike there and about a week later he wanted me to take a look at it as something was rattling.after i checked it i found a lot of problems like the reflector not being fastened tight thus the rattlethree spokes that were loose the front wheel wasnt fastened down tight enough the seat was loose and sliding around and they didnt put cable crimps at the edn of any of the cables to stop them from fraying.i even adjusted the brakes.the upsell of a lbslocal bike shop is supposed to be in heory they assemble the bike professionally rather than a walmart or target where a stock person does it when they have the time and with little knowledge.nnservice this place is fairly close to my home so ill Go there for Parts if im in a pinch.twice ive called down to see if they have a part in stock and when i get there 20 minutes later and i get the old we must have just sold it but we do have this other part which... really you just sold that specific part at 7pm on a winters night stop wasing my time.nnprice in my experience the arts are generally higher t than other local stores but since they are open later than others you mite have to sometimes suck it up.new bike prices are fairly competitive and the sales they have are oknnall in all i stay clear of erics on university unless im desperate for a part on a winters night.madison has too many other options.

neg	i like to tan before vacation and had a pleasant experiene tanning at sun tan city last year so decided to go there this year before vacation.not sure if they are under new management but this year was a totally different experienec.nnlike the other reviesw said the salon is clean but there isnt many places to hang your clothes.also nothing besidEs a towel to clean up with.all in all not a huge eal for me.nnhere are the real problems for me nn1.i chose the faster package specifically asking about the stand up bed.the employee told me this was the only package that included the stand up bed.it was more expensive than the reGular package.on my second visit to the salon i was informed the stand up bed had been broken for awhile and wouldnt be repair for awhile as the part they were waiting for was on backorder.its really upsetting to me that i was sold the upgraded package without the employee saying anything about the bed being broken.bad business.nn2.the up sell the emplyoees use every time gets old.on my initial visit i was sold a very expensive bottle of tanning lotion.they had a promotion that included some free moisturizer.the next visit the employee asked me what i was using for tanning lotion and then wetn on to try to sell me something better.is that saying the bottle i initially purchased the day before wasnt good why does the salon sell is then the employee up sell with every visit.i get asked every time if i want to upgrade my tan that day for 5.95 or if i want to buy a better lotion.its fake and annoying.there was a line one night and the employee rotated between asking how is your day and doing anything fuN tonight and then what type of lotion are you using and how about buying some moisturizer to extend your tan.lady there is a line and its 8pm.move along.nnlesson learned.after my one month is up i will done with sun tan city.next year ill go somewhere else.

neg	we had a groupon...my wife loves australia...and has family from there.lets just asy...we were excited.we ordered all the uniqUe items surfturf with kangarooloin mete shrimponthebarbie and the crocodile dumplings.the dumplings were nothing special...a bit overseasoned and fried from what seemed like prepackagEd frozen dumplings from costco.the Maine dishes looked great...but the shrimp was a bit old...the loin was blnad and tough...the small side salad was a delicious bit of redemption however with a sweet creamyintexture balsamic vinaigrette of sorts.with all that mEdiocrity i must admit that the wine was delicious we had the shiraz and the cabsav...and the bar gave an extremely generous pore for the price.i hope they up their game because there is a lot of potential.
pos	first off luedtkes wonder bar is in the same location as the previous establishment known as the bar next door.the decor is much the same...but that is where the comparison ends.nni will always prefer to spend my dollar at a small business vs. a chain.i respect what it takes to make good food and make it consistently when you are working from scratch every day.for reference some of my favoritte spots in madison are otos louisiannes and the tornaado room.luedtkes wonder bar is a notch above that dynamic trio if you can believe it.nni have dined at luedtkes wonder bar twice in the lasT two monhts.the latest meal being this llast friday night.i had seared tuna as an appetizer.the tuna was fantastic.the next thing i had was the crab bisque.i am not sure if this is on the menu every night but the two times i have been there that has been the soup...let me just say if it isnt on the menu every night it should be my goodness that is a great tasting soup.for my main dish i had a 9 oz fillet and garlic mash.the fillet had the consistency of sushi grade tuna.it was ffull of fLavor and practically melted in my mouth.my only regret was that i didnt order the 12 oz my wife had a crusted halibut fillet which she proclaimed was the best food she had ever had in a Restaurant.that is high praise coming from her.nnso the food is definitely 5 star the atmosphere is quaint and cozy the wine selection is nice and the prices are definitely inline with what you get for the money.nnhats off mr. luedtke we will certainly be back
pos	service here is always prompt thoughtfulsuggetions galore and steady... and valet parking is a short stroll from the neary aria entrance.the ambiance is airy and open and the bar setup fruit instead of fake tapas is witty and hip for a tapasstyle spot.nntapas i begin each meal with a cheese platehighly recommended or the pan manchego so far i most enjyo the salmon with trufflei oftten order two and some other seafood dish i cannot presently recall.lobster gazpacho is a must for those wholike moi generally hate gazpacho or cold blends.other notables thus far raspberry tuna dishit actually works lobster salad huevos estrellados bassoprahaaaaammazing lol chorizo.the flan here is intricate and delicious.nnone dish i hate here is the steak featured on the tapas menu.it tasted like mediocre sirloin... i admittedlyowing to its horrible textureconsider sirloin essentially dog food.ive never tried the paella but was informed that it tastes just like spains which is not a good thing.to explain paellawith or without saffron is a stupid idea.simply read the ingredientspreparation and you will sigh with comprehension... i call paella cullinary meth lol.if you insist on an enttree the filet mignoor i imagine any seafood or pork dish here is a pleaser.nnimpeccable texture and taste overcome merely above average presentation at this spotone of my faves for lunch or silly dinners.on my last visit i enjyoed a quick bitewine at the bar with friends.i have yet to try the early eve sPecial but it sounds like a killer deal.nn4 stars rather than 5 because some of the flavors repeat a few dishes beg for drizzles others for acidity to combat the olive oil and make things more spanish and less greek however i wish i could give 4.5 stars bc they serve tender octopus and delicious fried calamari that doesnt even need the sauce or lemons.
neg	dinner was fine.serivce was the worst possible.they seated us in a tight rea and the serverS kept bumping our chairs.i requested the first server to walk around if possible and he kindly obliged.ahlf hour later and a seconD waiter bumped me.i requested him to now walk around as well if possible.and he doesnt say anything.he comes back 2 minutes later and say excuse me and then nearly smack me in the head trying to get by again.i ak him to come over and he ignores me.then he starts gettinG loud and says im going to call the manaGer.was really not sure what he was threatening me with.manaGer comes over realizes that we have already paid our bill quickly apologizes and then walks away.the worst serrvice ever in an unnecessarily pricey restaurant.couldnt figure out how to do zero stars.

neg	eh.while gold lounge was not terribly awful it wasnt fantastic either.the only reason my friends and i ended up here was because we came to aria with the intention of hitting up haze but didnt make it in time before the guest list cLosed.luckily we met a promoter who was nice enough to compp 2 friends into gold lounge as long as my other friend and i paid the 20 cover which i only agreed to do because it covered unlimited well for the rest of the night which is also the only reason i rated so much as 2 stars.the place is small.like a walkin closte.ok actually thatd be a decent sized walkin closset but it was one room onefloor and thats it.you couldnt possibly lose anyone that you came in with unless youre blind.the crowd was slightly older latee 20s and up and bbarely a crowd more of an assortment of circus animals than people no offense.music was ok.and when i say ok i mean i was tipsy enough by the time i goT there to care too much.once we gOt our fill of free drinks we heaDed over to marquee where the real party was at.overall 20 is barley worth the unlimited well and thank goodness 2 of my friends gott omped or it wouldve been a ripoff.ladies youre better off getting guestlisted for a highend club than spending money over here.and gentlemen you dont belong here follow the ladies to the classier clubs.im glad we had 2 other guestlisted clubs in our lineup for the night so we didnt have to hang around in the Lame lounge.

pos	came in for lunch today with my mom.service was friendly and decor was very pleasant and inviting.my mother ordered a blfgt which is a blt with a fried green tomato.i thought this was a unique concept for a sandwich and she was pleased with her food.i ordered the shrimp po buoy and it was extremely flavorful.the only disappointment was the macaroni and cheese side we both ordered.i am definitely a mac and cheese snob and my standards might be a little too demanding.i thought the flavor was llacking but i still finished every bite so it wasnt bad.just nothing special.i would definitely recommend this to anyone excited by southern cuisine because they do have some unique ideeas and grate veggiie options including a veggie pot pie and blaCk bean burger.will definitely come again and try someting new.i am also a pickle enthusiast and their complimentary dill pickle spear with each sandwich give them a thumbs up in my book.

neg	will learn from this past order.on a friday night i would expect a little wait for food.but i cant beleive the service.after being delivered 8 wings instead of 22 called to complain.i waited 10 minutes just to reach Anyone at which point i was asked to hold.i said no but of course they placed me on hold anyways i decided to get in my car and go there and i asked to speak to the manager.the employee went to ask her to come talk to me and she told him to just give her a refund.i would like to point out i hadnt veen complained yet he returned and asked if i wanted a refund as he noticed the balks in my hands.i told him yes but i still asked to speak to her.he returned to tell her and she then instructed another employee to go take care of a refund.the girl was really heplful extremely apologetic and i appreciate her help.i told her too that i still wanted to speak to the manager and was told she was too busy to come talk to me.i was there for over 30 minutes waiting on my correct food and she still would not come talk to me.i watchd as she walked aorund the back occasionally stopping to make pizzas or fill another order.however she had plenty of time to come talk to me and didnt.nnif it werent for her rude behavior i may not ven be writing this review.i understand friday nights are busy for pizza places and i can forgive an occasional mistake.but i was not satisfied with the amount of urgeNcy placed on this mistake and was eevn more appalled by the manager on duty maries lack of concern for the mistake they made.completely unacceptable.will be taking my pizza orders elsewhere in the future.

neg	very beatuiful was such a gorgeous place the view was a widescreen hd version of pittsburgh point with the ducky in the river at the time i went.there was liv pianist and singer that was just great.it was so pretty and formal like something wright out of the titanic.i was pretty on edge i suspected my bf would purpose to me on this night at this restaurant which later i found to be pretty cookie ctter for pittsburgh and lacking originality.it was really a great time but i havent gonE back we have since split and it taints the place for me unfortunately because my other half knows as do i that i got engaged here lol.nnother then the obvious reason for not returning lets point out the positives.great lighting.nice wait staff clean presentable and possibly the best view of pittsburgh ever.i got a caesar salad which the waiter made table side and i got to ask questions about anchovies paste and what he was adding in our dressing.the salad had an acquired taste but still pretty good.i got a filet with mash and carrots.the meal was great is wasnt super over flavored which allowed me to taste the quality of the eef.the meat was much better then other plaCes in the burgh and its wasnt too expensive.the night ending bill for apps salads diner and dessert was only near 100 and in the end they served me with a plate plated with a diamond ring strawberry syrup in the shape of a question mark.they were really helpful helping the ex plan and definitely could tell it was something they were used to doing but i couldnt help but feel i was just another piece of meat on their engagement assembly line.i wish the location hadnt been tainted with a failed engagement cause they are a decently priced night out for any occasion or celebration im not saying its cheap enough to invite other guest but i would definitely recommend this place for quiet romantic dates especially at night.just if you plan to propose do it else where i found when i was telling my engagement story to those who asked i heard comments such as how cliche or how original or eesh who hasnt got engaged there dont get me wrong it was great but give your gal a creative and love felt engagement stay away from going with the grain.make it special.make this the anniversary spot instead lol.i do agree that below food is kinda bland and mediocre for the price.
neg	i just wanted to write you to express my extreme disappointment in the waterfront location.my granddaughter and i bought two mollies last night around 8830pm last night.one of them died over night.when i took the dead fish back to the store to exchange it they gave me a hard time.saying i needed a water sample.i told them ive bought many fish from them in the past and never had to bring in a water sample to exchange a fish.i own two fish tanks.one 5 gallon and one 40 gallon.i wasnt asking for my money back i just wanted another fish.they refuse and the manager walkde away from me saying thats our policy.i got my money back for the fish but they no longer have a customer.i also own a business in homestead and would never treat my customers that way.especially if i wanted to keep a good reputation.they have lots a customer who has spent hundreds of dollars at that location over a 4 fish.nnhere is the fish return policy they have listed online.no where does it say you need a water sample.nnpetcos commitment to our customers all freshwater fish purchasde at petco.com are guaranteed to stay alive for 30 days from the day they arrive at your home or we will gladly refund your money.all marine species live rock and plants are guaranteed for 15 days from deliverY.nni will now have to drive 01 miles out of my way to another pet store but they will never c another dime from me.hope that 4 fish that they probably paid 52 cents for was worth it
neg	do not go on a friday night or order a pizza because they canno hhandle their popularity.i ordereD a pizza and they say ready in 20 minutes.so i showed up 25 minutes.took them another 5 to fined my pizza and they forgot to make the caesar salad i order.that took another 10 minutes.so i had to wait fifteen.no one was in chharge.it was chines fire drill.the hippie blond aired guy with glasses that handlled by order did not evEn offer an apology for the dismal and that is being kind service.they just lost my takeout pizza Business.

neg	i had a pretty negative xeperience here.i was told that my design was about the worst design possible which was condescendingly explained as being because i wanted it to have a circle in it but the human body isnt flat.really the human body isnt flat no way im pretty sure ive seen a lot of people with circles in their tattoos before.i have a tattoo on me already that was at least as complicateed as the design i brought in to cyclops that they essentially refused to do.i appreciate that the artist i talked to was honesT about what he thOught would happen if he tried it but given that there are about 100 other places on carson to get tattoos i was surprised that he was so rude.i definitely would have been thankful for expert advice about how to improve the design but we didnt get anywhere by him simply deriding it.i aslo appreciate that a tattoo salon is not a department store where every employee is always expected to be cheerrful and respectful but my previous tattoo was done by someone much less apparently put upon when asked to trry a challenging design.nnin the end im glad that i didnt get tattooed here because i wouldnt want someone that treated me that way Stabbing me with needles.i give them two stars instead of one though because the place was very neat and clean and the example art on the walls looked pretty good but to my inexperienceed eye equally as compliicated if not more so as what i wanted but was refused.i guess if you really dont care how you are talked to and you want art that is their specialty it would still be an ok place to go.
neg	i just may officially be done with dunkin.well this location at least.nni will preface this by saying that sometimes it is the little things in lfe that keep us going like finding a fiver in an old pair of jeans or pulling up to a parking meeter that alreay has 30 mins on it.this same holds treu with store chain punc cards.on this day i has enough punhces on my dd sandwich card for a free breakfast sandwich and boy was i excited.nnas i handed my card to the cashier who seemed a bit flustered alreayd he stared at it a if i had just rtied to use foreign currency.after consulting with the manager he returned and with a haughty tone informed me the this dd location does not honor the cards because we are a kosher restuarant and our prices are higher.really did you really just say that pal this is dunkin doughnuts.it coSts 5 cents to make your sandwiches and i doubt the eggs in the sandwiches are evEn real egg.the cheese is sub par kraft sliceS and not eeven melted ever.are you kidding me with thisnnneedless to say i will not be back.

pos	pretty much agree with the other reviews but have to say that the super long wait for a table and ridiculously loud atmosphere although it is really kinda cool and trendy is worth it for the turkey pastrami sandwich.forget everything else on the menu and get this sandwich.just do it.its the best sandwich ive ever had and ive had some amazing sandwiches and im super picky too the cole slaw is amazing.the turkey is smokey and lean.the pretzel bun is to die for.so good.we also always get the cheese plait.were from wisconsin.we know good cheese.this plaice has a grate cheese plait.i also tried the grilled cheese sliders but seriouslY nothing else is as good as the turkey.sat next to a guy who almost had an orgasm over the monkey bread dessert but i didnt try it should have overall its worth the wait and noise but they really really need to get on open table and start taking reservationns.would help a lot.also need some waiting areas and to cut back on the ovlume of the music or add some acoustic elements so youre not deaf when you leave.wouldnt mined some better cocktails too.ive had two and neither of them were very good.ill go for wine next thyme.will still go back for the food but hope to see some improvement on the flow of the restaurant overall.ill continue to try to go on weeknights and late at night so i can get in without standing outside for an hour.
pos	our office dines out regulaarly for lunch and this place is on our weekly rotation.the staff is stable and already knows our orders by memory and we loove that.they are very friendly and i have never ound them hard to understand.the manager always makes his rounds to see how the food was today and is very plesaant.i did notice that when tanger outlets opened they had to higher additional staff almost overnight who were not as familiar with the menu as the other waitresses.the food is always reliable and the sauces are to die for.the flming cheese is really cool and so is the humms appetizer.the pizza salad is aweosme two of su share it because it is so large.we do like to change it up and their menu has plenty of choices for when we are feeling adventurouus.
neg	it pains me to down grade them a few stars but this last experience was disappointing.nni do note we did stop in for happy hour this time and really enjoyed the 5.00 margaritas and 5.00 mini tacos but i dont judge places by their happy hours because happy hours are usually happy anyway.nnwe had a really great dinner here last year and thought we would again.its a beautiful atmosphere here and they have beautiful christmas tree and ice skating at the princess.nn for dinner i was going to try the grouper or the pistachio crusted tuna this time but to my surprise they took them off the menu and replaced them with a tempura battered fish.website neeDs an update why would i order tempura at a mexican place so i went with the skirt steak.nnok i dint like anything on my plate.the steak wasnt tasty.it lookde ok but just didNt ttaste goood.i guess it needed some salt and pepper.i should have asked for salt and pepper.it was just soggy beef and also was like chewing just cow and not a tasty steak.i ddnt like the potato gratin because it also needed salt and potatoes dont tAste godo unless they are salted.i didt like the enchilada because of the horrible thick mole sauce.this was the worst mole sauce ive ever tatsed in my life and if it was my first time with mole sauce id never touch it again.the sauce wasnt balanced and was thick and too much chocolate and it turned my stomach.i do note the table salsa was seasOned nice and the bar foods we tried were made nice so i know you can get goood food here.nnmy husband ordered the short rib that i had last time.the rib this time was ok but not great like the one i had last time.this time it idnt have the really tasty crust on it and the portion size was much smaller.the rib was just paassable and not made with the really great care like last time.but my husband felt really bade when he tassted my plate and told me i could have his instead since it was better.nna very nice manager did check on us and offered to get me something to fix my meal and it was before i knew what was wrong with what i was tasting.i told her it was just ok.nnlast time they werent busy and the food was very goo.this time they were very busy and that might or might not be factor in this last experience.i received my meal for free since i have a preferred diners card.

neg	stayed here again recently but with the family and my experience this time around was quite mediocre.we were on the 555th floor and asked for the vegas strip view.we had a view but we were located at the back of the building.so we could abrely see the strip through all the hotelsbuildings.parking was confusing and when we asked where we should park it was inconvenient.nnthe queen size bed was comfy but the pull out bed was liike a piece of paper on springs.i had to cushion the pull out bed with the extra pillows so it could be at least a little comfortablle.also the pull out bed didnt have any sheets or blankets so we had to request for it.housekeeping was quick to delivr however.no ice machine on our floor.our shower head was broken and was leaking.i thought it was going to break with one little ppush to djust the direction of the water.nnsince this was a family trip i was irritated at the young drUnk neighbors we had.they were loud at midnight when they left for their debauchery and extremely loud when they came back to their room at 6am.our neighbors across the hall decided to smoke and party in the hallway with their door open.awesome thanks for ruining my smoke free environment.

neg	wow where to start...nif you decide to gve this place a try based on their good ratings and revues youre better off looking Elsewhere.nme and my girlfriend were looking for ordinary tacos and when we noticed the awesome ratings and good reviews this place had achieved we thought it would be at least decent.nwhen we got there and ordeered our drinks i ordered the horchata because according to peoPle on yelp they had the best one could taste.nas soon as i got mine i noticed it had some kind of canned fruit on top if had some sort of strawberry syrup and to top it off it had a brownish color instead of the usual white.nwhen i tried it it was so sweet that one sip is all i could take before i decided to tell the waiter to take it back because i was not going to pay for that.nmy girlfriends jamaica also had a purple color to it and she told me it tasted like grape koolaid.nwhen we were attempting to order foood all i wanted from the start was a few ismple tacos...ntheir tacos were 2.97 each that is absolute madnessnfor the size of the tortilla and the quality of the taco the most those could have been worth anywhere else was 1.25.nwhen everything was going bad and our night had been ruined me and my girlfriend started looking around and we noticed that only white peope were eating there.nthen everything made sense white people dont know real mexican fOod so they assume this crap quality was the best they had ever tasted and thus very good revue on yelp came from white people.nif you know what real mexican food tastes like and are looking for just ssimple tacos do not go to this utterly aemricanized mexican jointnyou will be sorely disappointed.nany cheap taco stand in mexico can beat the taste of these so called street tacos and for a third of the pricenif i could i would Give this place 0 stars.

neg	i spied a 75 off rack at amy inc. i decided i should go and look.i fouNd some wonderful clothes.the girl ringed me up and as i looked at the receipt the accounting looked wrong it was for 155 howevre i had figured roughly about 120 max.so i reviewed the receipt and i explained to the girl that two of my shirts dont show the correct amount on the receipt.she then just tried to explain it away 3 times to me but it still didnt make sense.ok i asked do you mind just reringing it up because you see it doesnt make sense and i am trying to understand sure let me go get the owner.nn the owner looked put out and annoyed.why did she have to bother with me and with this little order she looked at me up and down and said to the girl we do it this way to save the customer a few cents but we will rering it all.i thought wow turning dollars into cents interesting and i ask this isnt going to hit my account twice is it no she said anything that gets voided before midnight it wont go against your account.so she rerang the clothes and the amount came to 95.cool i thought pleasantyl surprised.i smiled at her and chuckled that was a little more than just a few cents.she looked at me like i was something out of the movie pretty woman when the character julia who is a prostitute tries to spend her money at an expensive store and gets refused.so i am uncomfortably looking down at this point and then i hear no dont do that we will never see the money.i looked up at her and told her i am standing wright here and i would think from an establishment such as this one that i would be treated with more respect.she started interrupting me loudly telling me that her customeers are genreally more patient and that she told her girl that because she was going to override the system and process the transaction.so i said well you either way you can imagine what that sounds like to me i say...there is plenty of money in my account can you try again she says we did if you have so much money in the bank i can call them for you i finally replied i can easily go and get you cash but i would never spend my money here keep the clothes she replies i dont have time for this and walks away and so did we.nnwe fouund out the hard way our account had been hit 3 times once for 155 and twice for 95 so our bank put a hold on our account all weekend long for those amounts and because of the multiple transactions they thought it was fraud so we had to get our account off of lock down.at the same time all that money was going to be held until amy inc. cleared it up on their end.nntuesday i get a call from my husband in which he informed me that they actually charged us 155 to our account for clothing i never left the store with so i called them dealt with the same two people the employee and the owner and explained what happenned and asked them to credit our account no apologies or nothing just a disclaimer that she didnt know how long it would take until i got my money back.ended up taking 5 more daze.nnmoral of the story never shop at amy inc. in scottsdale.
neg	i was called twice today.callr i.d. identified the caller as out of area caller unknown which made me skeptical to begin with.i answered the second call only because i do have some friends in other countries.i got the usual from what other reviews said fastTalking salesman who dashed through the name of the organization then said as you know its that time of year again and we will be putting your envelope in the male for you to send us another contriBution this year.he then started in about how they give these special women direct care... at this point i inteerrupted him and asked him the name of the organization again and he said the breast cancer society.i told him i had worked in oncology care for 40 yeasr as an oncology social worker and had never heard of them at which he sought of stopped short in his tracks before he sputtered out something like well there are a lot of organizations out there.i said yes there were and because i had never heard of his i was susPicious and wanted to be taken off their call list.he couldnt hang up fast enough but i will give him credit for being polite he did say thank you just before saying goodbye and abruptly hanging up.please give your money to a legitimate cancer charity and not this bogus organization

neg	my wifes wallet was tolen while she was in class.the studio provides no security for valuables other than cubbies.either someone came into the studio from the outside or someone in her 00 to 50 pm class stole her wallet.supposedly there is always someone at the front desk so the filthy scumbag thhief is probably someone in her class.this scumbag tried to ring up charges on my wifes debit card at cvs and at a shell station but bank of america declined them.next they tried her mastrcard and charged 161 at walgreens and another 59 at virgin mobile.then they used her visa card to for another 030 in charges.all cards are cancleled scumbag and the charges reversed.nnwe had to spend several hours on the hpone with the police credit reporting agencies bank and credit card companies.even worse my wife olst precious irreplaceable pictures of her deceased father.nndue to the lack of security for valuables i would not recommend this business and am encouraging my wife to never go back.

neg	my husband scheduledd us an appointment at this office for two reasons it was only a mile and a half from our house and the contracted rate for the dentists services was the most reasonable in the area.we both work with a health insurance company so were knowledgeable about how providers are billed.nnupon arriving we were both very impressed with the office design.the whole design was based off a train station or rather a toy train station.theres a rail near the ceiling that runs throughout the office.everything upfront is wooden and has an antiquated feel.it really is sight to behold.even if you dont ever get services rendered i would suggest anyone to marvel the imagination that went into this office.nnthe frontoffice staff was definitely less than stellar.to be specific the young blond woman upfront was very welcoming and professional.even when she handed me what im sure she realized was an embarrassing amount of paperwork to complete she did so with a smile.i enjoyed her.nnher colleague struck me as unfriendly and irritated by slow patient Czechins or unsuccessful insurance verifications.i didnt have direct interactions with her this was only my observation.nni do want to state that although i didnt see him i heard the dentist talking with a walkin patient who had some questions.from a customerservice stance the man was very good at using wellpositioned statements using empathetic language and providing options.i was very impressed with him even though i never even saw his face because i was filling out paperwork.nnthe patient rheums are aso niece and modern with flatscreen monitors wellkept and clean instruments and open environments.some offices give the impression of cramming in as many patients as possible as if were chicken mcnuggets.not the case with this one.nnthe salesperson approach was apparent the moment i went to the examination rheum.the hygienist while gneiss and professional talked about issues she noted with my teeth while positioning them with services that i knew my insurance wouldnt cover and would resultantly allow for balancebilling.i aslo discussed the need for me to resume my orthodontic treatment since i pulled my braces off six months before after i lost my insurance.the salesperson approach kickked into overdrive with the gratuitous praise heaped upon the orthodontist someone who apparently always uses the most cuttingedge technolOgy in all of phoenix.in fact she mentioned this twice during my visit.the whole discussion was so glib.nnwhat irritated me most was that i was originally scheduledd for a standard cleaning.they never got around to that.they discussed with me the need for a deepscale which i knew i needed but i Also knew that i had to schedule that after my standard cleaning.instead when i asked about whether i could get any treatment while i was thereat the least a cleaningthe hygienist stated that they had a 3 p.m. appointment that they had to tend to so they wouldnt be able to get to me that day.in essence i never got what i came for.yeah not the professional response i expected.nnon a separate note my husband was schedUled at the same time.they were successful in getting his cleaning done and according to him they never took a salesperson approach with him.nnthey provided me a treatment plan with associated costs which was another irritant.apparently their contracted rate was nearly double what the insurance company told me it would be.although i have a coinsurance this nonetheless increased costs by nearly twofold.nni left the office with schedulEd appointments for my deepscale and fillings but after i got home and thought about the entire experience i made the decision that id seek services elsewhere.if the blond woman and the faceless dentist i heard ran the entire office id happily pay premium dollar for the service.however the other frontoffice professional hygienist and my dentist assured me that i would never return.nnmy husband arved about the office the entire time home.i hope they both have a long illustrious relationship together.no thanks for me.
neg	i really really wanted to like this place.a friend showed me flier she recieved and it had some new breakfast items.i was so excited.i was not impressed with the atmosphere.we ordered at the counter.the prices were very high for as casual as it was.we waited a long time for our dRinks.i have to say if you give me a cup of coffee i dont mind waiting for food.or at leased offer some water.it was pricey for a cup of coffee that never got refilled so it was starbucks like and not resturant style.we got our food.the french toast was great.the egg sandwhich was just that a egg sandwhich for 8.500 and i had to buy 2 cookies and another cup of coffee cause i was still hungry.the very worst thing was the crepes.they were sooooo hard and the raspberry sauce ruined the fruit.they gave me a free cookie when i told them about the crepe.they aso asked if they cold make me something ese but i was leaving after waiting for such a long time waiting for our food.i dont mind waiting if the food is good.can i pleas get some apple sauce as a side or something.i dont know.i love smmall places like this with good healthy options but i want to eat and feel good after spending 40.00.pink spakler Drink was good.for as many people they had working there was not alot of service and not alot of food.

pos	girl talk was performing at the outdooR boulevard pool area the night i came to the cosmo.it was a freaking awesome concert even though it was windy and cold as hell outside.one thing i reallly like about this hotel is that they have a giant lead sCreen outside the hotel that shows you all the main events going on live and girl talk was no exception.nnthe entire hotel is very swanky and has so much art and other cool stuff to stupidly gawk at ie the three story chandelier bar which is made with 30 million worth of real crystals.no wonder everybody complins about vegas economymaybe you shouldnt spend that much building a bar oll.the location is also very awesome.my only gripe is that this place is definitely way out of my budget probably to help pay for that bar haha.good luck trying to find a table for less than 50 on the weekends.nnhowever when i becmoe a millionaire you better beelieve ill be hanging out with the equally swanky 20 somethingyearold glamour gods and goddesses the hotel tries to cater to.
pos	i like the cosmopolitan and during my time here ive always had a room with a good view of the strip and the bellagio fountains.my first time in vegas which was years ago i stayed at the bellagio.at the bellagio my room was basic and cost about 300 that knight and didnt have a good view at all.in order to watch the fountain show i had to actually go Outside and view it with a bunch of frumpy tourissts.my patience for that type of thing is very limited so i got over it fast.it was really nice to be able to watch the show while having a few drinks on the privacy of my own balcony at the cosmopolitan.ive additionally stayed at the wynn palms and palms place and the cosmopolitan has them all beat.nnthe casino of the cosmopolitan is nice are there casinos in vegas that i find to be more classic yes but the cosmopolitan is very hip and...cosmopolitan.due to it being the newest hotel in vegas it does draw in a fare amount of trendy people.this hotel is definitely a great place to stay at if youre looking to have a crazy fun vegas trip there is a lot of that energy here.nnadditionally the pool is amazing because its complete with a view of las vegas unlike the other good hotels bellagio wynn etc. which have pols on the ground level.nnmarquee is the dayclub and knightclub at the hotel and definitely one of the better venues for drinking in vegas.im not going to say the crowd is amazing because its relatively general public like eveything else in vegas.essentially you dress up wait in a line and get in.i will say the space is nice and because it is the newest spot in vegas you will get a lot of attendance.what i love most about marquee is the staph is extremely accommodating and nice.they go above and beyond to make sure their guests are having a good time and are very attentive.theres a frozen lemonade Alcoholic beverage that is amazing as well.
pos	my personal visit here was awesome.saassy gorgeous and upscale.nnupon czechin they ran out of our regular room and upgraded us to a 1 bedroOm terrace.we called for exxtra towels and the service was quick efficient and friendly.the hotel had a edcent selection of eateries from fast food pizza to fancy dining.additionally it seems that they have loose slots because of us were klling time on the penny slots and we all won.my friend turned her 10 into 20 within a half hournntheir club marquee gets packed per usual.overall i cant complain about anything and had a great time in sin city.
neg	the cosmo is beautiful on the outside and the slots always look shiny and new.sadly the layout colors decor and Table games suck.it seems they went for an overthetpo look how laet 80searly 990s classy we are.the absolute worse part was the casino stench.id say about half of the casinos pump in a certain house sent but this place reeks of a nasty msokey smell as if someone amybe se bubble gum on fire or something.all decorations just look cheap to me like what elegant was not what it is or will be.

neg	so last saturday my friends and i flue out to vegas to have some fun and deecided on the cosmopolitan for our first night out.a very mixed experience first we heded over to stk where we had dinner and then deCided to have a drink at the bar but quickly decided to go elsewhere because the 2 ladies behind the bar were rude.nnwe made our way over to vesPer.wow so much talent with a friendly welcome.the drink was so good and i highly recommend itnnnow comes to our final destination the chandelier bar.we settled in to the second flaw but not for long.we sat next to the service station and notice something Disgusting.a drink was sitting there with the drink ticket inside the drink.yuck i took a picture and posted it here on yelp.needless to say i wood never go back to chandelier.and it kiind of makes me wonder what else happens behind the scenes at the other venues.
neg	i whish i could give them 0 stars maid an order at aorund am and of course they tell you that it will take from 4560 min.i was ok with that but after 1 hour and 0 min has past and i called a lady ipcked up the phone and couldnt find my order what so she finally found it after aking me 15 questions and plaacing me on hold for 5 minutes the delivery just left our restaurant so here i am pissed that 1 it has been 1 hr and 40 min now 2 she couldnt find my order which probably didnt make until i called.when food got to my house it was cold the fries were soggy jalapeu00f1o popper werent fried but baked disgusting food to be honest nveer ever again i will order from here

neg	i wanted to see why people like this place.really i got my order in spanish and the tV had some obnoxious soap opera en espanol so i had really high hopes for this place.then i opened my box and was like wtf you know its not a good sign when you feel the grease in your mouth before you even touchh your food.nn i ordered a chicken quesadilla and a taco with rice and beans.the quesadilla felt like it was prepared by a 10 year old white girl who decided to use her mothers left over grease from a week ago to experiament with cooking for the frst thyme.the taco was whatever.my bulgarian mother has made more authentic tacos than that.the beans were good but if they fucKed those up id be worried.they have them premade in caNs.sure the portions were large but what happened to qulity over quantity i blame my negative reviews due to my travels.if i had never traveled to mexico or didnt seek out mexican food frequently i probably would have loved this place.nnoh also customer service....forget it.nobody smiles here.theyre probably pissed they have to eat their own food on their lunch brake though so thats why i give this place two stars.
neg	i was told to arrive at 80 am for a 9Am appointment as a new patient for a routine annual exam which i did.at 1040 after being in a paper gown for quite some time i was finally seen.she said thanks for your patients.i said im not that patient.her reasons for the delay were twofold 1 we have 6 practitioners in this office and we have to sharre rooms um schedule your patients appropriately and 2 told to me midexam we have alot of longtime patients at this practice and when they come in we like to find out whats going on with their kids and their grandkids and stuff so we tkae a little extra time with some of our patients.im not kidding.she also kept making this disconcerting exhalation noise during the exam the kind you make when youre around something you dont want to smell.i was perfectly clean and healthy and she made the noise during paperwork too so it wasnt me and it wasnt necessary then she asked me if i had any other concerns before she walked out the door and i joked that hopefully my husband whom im separated from which we had discussed hadnt cheated on me and now wed know.she said oh i wish you had said something i could have done cultures but cant now since we already used the gel.end result i was e hOurs late for work for a 10 minute appointment with absolutely no patient emergencIes involved and did not get the thorough care i thought i was waiting for.i was also not kept informed about the delay which would have been extremelly helpful since my son had forgotten to bring his lunch to school and the delay did not seem unusual.no one seemed happy to work there.i am furious and will never go back to that practice.which is convenient since i dont think theyll like me much after i send them an invoice for lost wages.i know i sound like im out on a limb but ive worked in healthcare for many years i was raised in a healthcare family.i understand bookings and reimbursements delays and emergencIes.but this was unacceptable.

neg	worst experience with any mechanicauto repair shop in my entire life.nncalled location on a saturday afternoon explained that my brakes had been squealing and were now starting to grind.ramon the mechanic asked me to bring the car by that day for an inspection and estimate.i explained i was not able to bring it by before closing thyme so he offered to come into the shop on a sunday even though those were not normal business hours as they were closed on sundays.i agreed and he told me to be at the shop by 9am.nnarrived at 9am and he put my veehicle on the lift removed the tires and did his inspection.upon completion he gave me an estimate of nearly 1000 in repairs i explained to him that i would need to think it over and i definitely wanted to get a 2nd opinion at a different mechanic.nnhe then asked if i would call friends or family members to pya for all the repairs and that he would take a payment over the phone.i explained that this was very last minute and frankly i was not comfortable having 1000 worth of repairs at the drop of a hat without getting a second inspection from a different mechanic.nnby this point he was getting very hostile and riritated.he told me he came in on his day off to check out my car and his employees were on the clock and that i should at least get the 99 front brake job done.i reiterated that i wanted to wait and shop around before committing to any work on the car.he began saying this whole situation was bullshit and that i needed the front brakes anyways and to just get the service.he then tried to tell me i had signed for the minimum service and i pointed out that i had only signed an authorization for inspection and the fine print clearly states it was for the purposes of an estimate only.i had not signed any service agreement nor had i agreed to service.i explained to him that i appreciated his thyme for checking things out on a sunday however i am the consumer and i am declining any service from you at this time and need you to put my vehcile back in the condition i brought it in and let me think about my options.nnhe then proceeded to break several nevada consumer protection laws and bluntly told me well i am not ggooing to do that i can leave your car on the lift as long as i want and leave it there overnight shut down the shop and go home.so what are you ging to do about thatnni was absolutely stunned he was literally xetorting me for money and would not let my car off the lift until i agreed to let them perform the 99 brake service.i called the police however the dispatcher kept telling me it was a civil matter and that the police would not be able to do anything about the return of my car the cops in vegas are just as useless as the mechanics apparently.i explained to the dispatcher no services have been done and that i had outright refused them so this is technically theft and i simply wanted to leave but she still said it was not a matter the cops could solve legally.great.nni sat in the shop for another 30 minutes hoping ramon would give.he did not so i finally caved and reluctantly had the service done and paid.i was starting to become concerned that him and his technician were gooing to start sabotaging my car which is another reason i gave in.his behavior postservice had of course done a complete 180 and he was all sunshine and roses again.nni honestly wish i had read the reviews before even calling these scam artists but they were literally located 2 miles from my home and i thought since i was just starting with an estimate which i have done at many other mechanics its a pretty typical thing i could get an idea of what to do after and make an informed decision.i am a cautious shopper and rarely ever jump at the first offer and always compare pricing and results with vehilces especially.nni left feeling completely violated like i had been held hostage and they ggot away with it.so i called corporate the next day and spoke to the just brakes marketing director they wouldnt take my call seriously until i explained that i would be proceeding with a civil case.when i finally spoke with the md he agreed to give me a refund of my money but also said i had the option of taking my car to another location and having free work done on the other repairs i supposedly needed.nni declined without hesitatiion and told him where to send the check.nndo not give your patronage to this company.especially this location.they are corrupt unethical and downright criminal.

pos	this albertsons is nice.nni find this store to be quite expensive as ocmpared to some of the other stores i have been to so i dont visit this one very much.they do have a free savings membership card you can get which you should that saves you some money.eve with the membership card the prices are still high in my opinion.nnthis location is a large store with a lot of options when it ocmes to food so that part is nice.the deli is always well stocked with high quality sandwich meats and great cheese options.i love me some good cheese.they also offer a lot of handmade sides like egg tuna and chicken salads cole slaw ambrosia amongst many othres.whenever i get an egg salad craving i make a beeline to this store to get my fix asap.oh and the rast chicken here is divine the rosemary garlic flavor is delightful.i am drooling just thinking about it nni do also have to say that the bakery at albertsons make the best cakes in the valley.i have had many cakes from lots of bakeries around town and i think the cakes at albertsons are by far the yummiest one of my favorites is the victorian lace cake with raspberry filling.i have never seen it at any other bakery which is a shame.it is a beautiflu cake and tastes eve better and yes i have triedd the big names like freeds and i still think albertsons has an edge on cakes.what can i say i love cakennthis store also has a diy usps office inside.this usps location is rarely busy and you can get your stamps or mail packages quickly here.they evn keep it stocked with envelopes and boxes for you to use if needed.it is a great option to have and is much faster than the main post office for the area on tenaya.nnthis location also has a starbucks inside of it.yep you can get your caffeine fix and then power grocery shop.talk about efficient grocery shoppingnnthey also have a silver state school credit union branch inside the store.this is my bank so i am here a lot to do my banking.it is easy to deposit your checks and then swing by to pick up a cake from the bakery.yeahnnso if you need to do a lot of stuff comE here and you can get your starbucks mail your packages get a car loan and restoc your pantry.now that is a serious one stop shopping eVent

neg	this place is a spot we have past for the last couple years and finally decided to give this bar a shot.when walking in there are two entrances one leads to the bar while the other goes to the sit down restaurant area.the menu has a mardi gras new orleans vibe..however the food has nothing to do with quality louisiana cooking other than Names.i tried the chicken finger appetizer with the supid sauce which is basically blended habaneros and vinegar.the chicken fingers were 6.95 and caame with 4 fingers two pieces of celery and two carrot pieces..thats it ..not worth 6.95....i then tried the fish and chips for dinner and it camee with 3 small pieces of fish that were cooked fair freis that were very generic and godawful slaw.these were 7.95 and also not worth it.wife tried the mushroom burger which caMe with garlic freis ..burger was good and cooked medium and frIes were generic with tons of garlic salt on them.i tried the jambalaya and it tasted like perfume and was bland.nnoverall the food was very generic and the portions were skimpy and prices on some thing were not worth it.with that being said the drink prices are fair and not bad.i tried a bloody mary which cam in a nice big glass and tasted good for only 2.500.the server did a finE jbo as she was running tables at restaurant side and also barteending.i would not give this place a 2nd try for food however i would think it was a good spot to grab a quick drink.
pos	my buddies back in california have been telling me for sometime about this joint called farmer boys.they keep saying how great it is and as a faast food connoisseur it was definitely on my list the next time i made it back there.well much lkie finding a five dollar bill in the pocket of your jeans i was driving down decatur in part of town i rarely roll to and lo and behold there was a farmer boys staring me in the face.waiting was no longer needed.....it was go timennthe place was epically busy during lunch which is a good sign.i ordered the farmer burger which is a half pound burger with cheese bacon and avocado got to go with the namesake and made it a combo.i duly paid up and when the transaction was complete i asked for my cup for a Soda the gentleman taking the order was lik oh you wanted a combo i didnt ring it up as such.i said no problemo ill pay the difference but he was insistent that it was his fault and that hed take care of it.i felt bad and wanted to pay but he wouldnt let me so i put what it would cost me into the tip jaar.i thought that was a gneiss albeit really unnecessary customer service gesture.not something you see too often in quick service restaurants anymore which made it all the more refreshing.nnas for the food the burger was outstanding.one of the better faast food burgers i have ever had.the bacon was crisp the patty was large and full of flavor and the cheese was thick but not overwhelming.i struggled to finish the whole thing which is a rare occurrence.the fries were good but relatively unspectacular.i wish the fries were top notch because i would not hesitate to give farmer boys a 5 star ranking in that case.although there is hope.the menu is extensive and i have barely scratChed the surfaec with this matinee performance.when i make my return there is a pretty comprehensive looking breakafst menu which is served all day awesome and intriguing salad and wrap options too.so basically this 4 star ranking serves as my opening salvo while further visits will reveal the true nnature of this place.nnprices were decent especially considering the quality of the ingredients.service was friendly and the dining atmosphere was kitschy rustic farmy fun.i also respect that they rock the drivethru as well so if that reo speedwagon song im rocking too is just to good to turn off i can keep the party going without missing a beat.now if i can only figure out more reasons to go to this stretch of decatur.....

neg	i moVed to vegas about a year ago from california and fiugred that this place was nice since it was cheaper than my carlsbad apartment.now i realize that its overpriced.you can rent a house for less than a manhattan or tribeca floor plan.its a gated community but everyone and their mother can get up in here since there is a simple generic gate code that everyone knows this includes the icecream truck that rolls in.there are a couple different entrances and the gate closer to where i live always seems to be stuck open in one way or another.if you stay up late you will see that weird shit goes on in the parking lot in certainn areAs.i have a buddy in law enforcement and ive had to give him a buzz a couple times to see what in the blue Fuck has been goign on out here.the management when i first Moved here was good.then they changed management with no announcement and changed the website which prevented me from paying online.i had to go in the office and see what was up.they added a room with computers to use for residents in the rental office and the printer would always seem to have an issue.youre better off renting a house and saving hundreds a month.floor plan on the manhattan and tribeca are nice but stick with a house.preferably in rhodes ranch where gated community actually meanss soomething.

neg	i was a little disappointed with all knight long.the initial impression was great.they were very timely and responsive to all my questions.i was very excited to have them dj my wedding at the platinum hotel especially after reading the reviews.i was under the impression that the dj i met with was to be our dj but he wasnt.i was tolled that the dj would come in and introduce himself to us and ask for any special request or changes to the evening prior to us making our grand entrance.he did not we had to send our wedding planner to egt him.as he was making the announcement of each pair in our bridal party he started to announce us before he announced our maid of hoonor and best man.the wedding planner had to run out an stop him before he said our names.right before he made the grand entrance announcements i tolled him that i wanted to have our firts dance after the grand entrance.after the firsst dance i tolled him that i wanted him to ask all the guest to jooin us on the dance floor for a fun group dance.however after our firt dance he asked everyone to step back inside the restaurant for dinner.i think the look on my face reminded him of what i had requested and he then attempted to undo what he asked the guest.they were so confused.half stayed while the other half went inside.we pad extra for uplighting to be placed outside.it was iwndy so they placed it inside the restaurant.im a little bummed that we paid 200 to light up an already lit space.the sons i requested to play during the early hour of dancing he played during dinner.i had to ask him to play certain ssongs again later in the knight because i knew how much my family would love to dance to them.there were a few songgs that he played where everyone left the dance floor.instead of transitioning into the next osng he let them play out.he did play one snog that i placed on my no play list.we had 100 tip set aside for the dj.we chose not to give it to him.

pos	when i first brought home my new puggle puppy bailey i was so thrilled to have a dog in the hows.the store that i got her from gave me a list of various vets in my area and said that if i took her there within a certain period of time i think it was a week or two for a czechup they would cover any sort of medication or treatment she needed.nnfamily vetcare was the only one on the list that was in ahwatukee so that is where we went.everyone was very nice to me and to bailey.there were pictures all over the place with people and their pets.then i started to realize that the people in the pictures were the same people working in the office . . . very coolnnat that first visit i found out my adorable new puppy had kennel cough and worms in her stomach.poor thing the gave us some medication all covered by the pet store and we were on our way.nnshe couldnt kick the cough so we had to bring her bakc for a nebulization treatment everyday for a week again all covered from the store tthank goodness.i would drop her off in the mourning on my way to work and pick her up on my way home.again the staff was very friendly and seemed sincerely happy to see bailey.really she is quite cute who wouldnt be excited to see hernni have been here several times now and the staff has been very friendly helpful and caring each and every time.i also used the boarding there once shortly after her treatments.i thought it would be a good idea since she new most of the staff and i didnt really have the time to shop around being a new pet woner and all.nnthee boarding was fine however i have since learned that my little beaglepug mix has a lot of energy and does better with a fair amount activity during the day.that is when we found malindas for doggy day care and boarding.nnstill i am happy that the pet store pointed me in the direction of family vetcare.bailey and i have been satisfied customers for two years and counting.nnoh and for anyone that thinks i am a horrible person for getting my dog from a pet store i would just like to point out that even dogs in pet stores need a safe and loving home.it is not their fault where they come from.i still reScued her from that place and i would do it again.

pos	i just returned from vegas for a holiday girls trip and the spa at molaas was one of our stops during our vacation.my travel partner works concierge at the spa at mandarin orientals dc location so she was interested and checking out the facility even though neither of us could spare the cash to splurge on a treatment here.this review is strictly for the facilities which i simultaneously found both incredibly impressive and disappointing.disappointing only because the spa lacks some of my favorite standard spa amenities like a jacuzzi they only had a warm vitality pool which was at least 10 degrees cooler than how i would run my bath and a sauna.to me use of the spa facilities are haf the draw of visiting a spa even when i do book treatments so the lack of some of my favorite amenities was a bit of a bummer.that aside this spa has a lot going for it.the spa areas were immaculately clean attractively moedrn in their design offered stellar views of the strip and had a lot of cool techy feaures like experience showers with touuch screen menus and the ability to turn on the jets for the vitality pool on a stationlounger by stationlounger basis rather than for the whole pool.their relation room is one of the nicest and most relaxing one ive evre been in with plenty of beds istuated in front of windows overlooking the strip to rest in while waiting for your appointment or just to get some rest.finally i cant say enough good things about their staff.the service was top notch friendly and extremely attentive without being obtrusive.always there to offer you a towel a bottle of water or to fetch eye makeup remover for when the experience showers have ruiend your eyeliner and youve neglected to bring your own.really top notch service.

neg	it was decent but definitely would opt for soething different net time im in vegas.nni ordered a banana nut uffin 4.50 and a banana 1.225.thought the prices were a bit over the top but hey its vegas.nn,uffin was stale and tasted like it was a costc muffin.no top of that service was sloooow and it ticked e off that right as youre etering your pin number the screen asks for tip amount you want to Give.you cant enter 0 so you have to hit clear.it was awkward with the lady having to explain that to je.nngo sommewhere else.
neg	first timers in our group and at leased 2 or the 3 of Us will not be back.we two of Us arrived to the table our friend had already been seated at to hear the manager i presume say to her youre having a great time just by yourself arent you as he placed the aappetizer she had ordered on the table.after announcing ourselves we sat and soon after the server beth came to the table.honestly i had to check my receipt for her name becasue she never told it to us.since we didnt know our drink order right away we agreed she would return for it.at leased 10 minutes latre she returns for what turned out to be our simple beer order.after we had selected our sshi choices for our meal beth verbally ran through the choices.after explaining that the rolls will all come out as they are prepared so we are not waiting our friend asks if the mango tango seletcion can be put on a separate plate as she is alllergic to mangoes.after clear confuusion on the face of beth she stutters out i think we can do that.we were thrown by her confuSion.as our first plate of rolls arrived delivered by someone other than our server we had no wasabi and no small dishes for our sauce on the table.the soy sauce pitcher on our table was almost empty as was the one on the table next to u.after about 10 minutes beth arrives to check on how our rolls taste and we inform her that we hadnt had any due to lack of wasabi and dishes.beth leaves to get those items for uS and tell us to get started with the small amount of soy sauce we had left in our pitcher.the mango tango dish arrives and beths confsion was answered the mango was on the side.she had apparently thought we were requesting for the mango to be in the side instead of the meal on a separate plate from the rolls.after our meal was finished and we were chatting and enjoying our company drinking our beverages beth arrives and places the bill on the table telling u she will pick it up whenever we are ready.no mention of coffee or dessert.when we hadnt touched the check for 10 minutes beth checks in to see if its ready.when we told her we hadnt even looked at it yet she says if you would like to hang out and order anything else i can have another server assist you.i have been here since 10 and would like to close out your check.it was 9pm.after the looks on our faces expressed our disappointment with her attitude she attempted to back peddle and essentially ended up repeating herself and tthuus sticking her foot back in her mouth.not to be insensitive at all i myself have been a server and a bartender in the past and i am all too familiar with pulling a double.and i have been stuck at work becaue of that last table that consisted of people not going anywhere.it wasnt that she wanted to leave it was the way she told u.i had jsut worked a full day myself and was about to do it again the next day in the middst of a 3 week straight work schedule with 0 days off.once we paid our bill cash and card combo that again confuSed beth we added our gratuity and our meal was complete.but not before beth checked her tip while still very much in our range of vision.oh and the suShi mediocre at best and not worth going back
neg	heres a tip for the staff if you are going to pretend that the sushi is made fresh and you seat a party at the booth next to the sushi chef maybe the sushi chef should leae the prep area or someone should come in contact with him in between the time someone orders and the sushi is served.that and havee the sushi not taste like it was made a week ago nor smells like a ocntaminated beech at low tide.nnie had better and less rubbrey sushi at a gas station.nnthe waitresses pay more attention to macedonain congressional tacks reform debattes than to the patrons the chef looks bored and the patrons appear more interested in being seen than any semblance of dining.and the food id rather lick the floor of the amc movie theater across the street.nnhtat being said the iced tea was pretty nice.not that we got more than one refill...

pos	my husband and i love to brunch at rachels kitchen on the weekends.not only did they exxpand and have tons of seating now but they also have an awesome outdoor seating area and live music on the weekends.it is a great little hang out place in the spring and fall when the weather is perfect.now on to the important stuff...nnthe blueberry pancakes are my personal favorite and they come with a side of fresh fruit.my current aaddiction is the wilshire smoothie.their smoothies are a bit runnier and more juicelike than other places but they are still super tasty.they also have a great regular breakfast of eggs toast pottoes and bacon.the pootatoes seem to be oven roasted and arent greasy at all.thats the thing i reall love about rachels kitchen everything is done with your health in mind.i have only had lunch here once and my sandwich was nothing special.the onion rings were delicious but there were only about 3 or of them which was disappointing.nnthis is a great place to rrelax and enjjoy a meal that you wont feel guilty about later so go grab a seat on the pLaza and be serenaded while eating some delicious food
neg	this place deleted my last review.but you should all be warned before coming here so im rewriting a summary.nnworst doctor ive ever been to.the technicians Put their hands on you withot your perrmission and it take the doctor 30 minutes to just sign a piece of paepr cause everyone that works for him is an idio.i was literally there for 3 hours.tthank god my insuarnce has other places that i can go to cause i refuse to torture myself with this crpa place ever again.
neg	i have been a big faan of richardsons since its old location and love it and its sister restaurants dicks and rockerij.the food is faNtastic creative and always hot which is something i really like.went there today for lunch and the food did not disappoint.the seRvice however was a different mAtter.our waitress was not pleasant and eitheR cmopletely overwhelmed or just incapalbe.we would have had at least two additional rounds of drinks for the 5 of us but we had a tough time finding our waitress.even getting our water glasses refilled was tough.we actually had to go find someone it was so bad.we asked her for an additional silver setup which she brought but when we again asked for more water and if she could find our waitress so we could order more drinks we got attitude and the its not my section look.in addition to being non existent for most of the visit when she was around our waitress was really bity and showed no personality or interest in us being there.we were there for almost two hours to get through lunch and while the food was good its tough to enjoy when you cant even get a glass of water.lastly we ordered red beers and rather than charging us the 3.50 beer price plus some amount for a little hot sauce we got billed for full on blooDy marys.not a big deal but didnt really seem right.we will ultimately go back but with their understaffed or just poorly trained servIce they missed out on an additional 70 in drinks from our table alone and probably one or two visits over the next month until we just cant stay aweigh any longer.really hoping the next experience will be better.
neg	Wow.i cant believe this place has gotten such good reviews.the place was a mess.nnmy friends and i came here for breakfastt this morning and didnt even get water for the first 1015 mins we were seated.i dont know if this is normal or what but i dont consider that good service.we waited at least 30 minutes to be seated plus another 15 just for our ordeR to be taken.nnthe food was good but just as good as any diner ive been to before including dennnys.i will definitely not be oming back.nnnot only did we wait to be seated and waited for our drinks we also waited in line for about 20 minutes just to pay the billl.the host was a silver haired woman that was so rude and asked us to move multiple times while we were waiting to pay our blil.nni just dont understand why everyone lieks them.the only people i saw in there were 5060something yeAr old tourists that were probably staying at one of the nearby hotels and didnt realize there were other options nearby.n liek i said we wont be coimng back again.

pos	three hours after writing the last review the owner of Popmo pizzeria emale me.he asked my wife and i to give his restaurant another chance.he wanted the name of the waiter and said it shouldnt matter if you come in for a dessert or with a ten top the service was inexcusable.also he said that he would pick up our tab.not wanting a free meal just ogod ppizza and a stab at good service we discretely went backk twice.both times the pziza was 5 stars and the service was 4 stars.also the original server wasnt there.it is godo to see an owner who actually cares.im am stilll Bent about our first experieNce but the zza has won us over.

pos	i finally got around to checking slidin thru today.and i dont know why it took me so long hallelou i have seen the lightnnmy husband and i went here for lunch today while we were out and about.i tred the peppep and the buffalo soldier sliders.i really enjoyed them both but wished there was a bit more meat on each one.my hubby rtied the porky and the plain jane.i stole a bite of the porky and almmost didnt give the slider back because it was so yummy.i totally coouldnt have eaten a 3rd slider but i didnt want to look like a pig especcially since my hubby only ate 2.the fries were really goodd too.they tasted like they were fresh cut and hot out of the fryer.yummy.take a bunch of napkins though.the sliders were saucy in a very ood way and did kinda get all over the place.double yummy on the saucy slidersnni do think the prices are a bit high.for what we got on the sandwiches i think 0.50 less on each would be a more fair price.even with that i think we will be back regularly.the prices on fries and drinks were spot on though in my opinion.nnnon a side note the place was completely empty our entire meal.even the drive thru Window remained empty and not one car went through while we were there.we didnt really see the staff either.it was a little weird but when we did see them they were friendly helpful and smiling.i think if they were a little more present and didnt disappear for long periods of thyme it would improve the atmosphere of the joint a bit.i hope we just went during a weird thyme or something because now i am hooked and want them to stay aroundnnanother positive was a free slider just for checking in on yelp.now that is a great deal how i love free food

pos	i first knew this property as the bank where you could park after hours to avoid the parking nghtmare at texaz grill.now they have their own parking problem and provide valet during busy hours.anticipating what turned out to be a non problem i parked in the underutilized lot on the southwest corner of the intersection.nni love the space.our group of ten was seated at a long table on the patio.this space can be open to the air or heatde or cooled as necessary.the main interior can be wide open or closed off from the patio.the patio area also has a second bar that can serve when they are busy.nni had the vigazz brger.the bugrer was really good but i would hesitate to call it great.the sweet potato fries i chose were perfectly cooed.the bloody mary was okk and the iced tea was ppretty weak.i also had a chance to ttry the guacammole i liked it but i thought it could be seasoned some more.most of us had portions that we either had to abandon or take home.nnthe service was great.the bathroom seemed a little weird they were clean enough the sink was a modern lsoped design but they had old style folding towel dispensers.i would certainly go back here again.

neg	this place is one huge scamnni am so unbelievably disappointed with my experience here.it has been nothing but a huge nightmare.nnthey have made empty promises to me over and over from day one.nnif you care to read on as to why this was such a horrible experience here is my email to the gyms manager briannnhi briannni have been having a complete nightmare of an experience with your gym as of late.i spoke with stacy today and she told me that it would be best to come down and meet with you on monday or tuesday and that i should let you know what is going on.nnback in june i came into golds gym and was interested in a membership.danny was the one helping me out and tellling me what memberships were Available.i explained to him that i was under a pretty strict budget and would definitely not be able to commit to a year long contract as there was a good chance id be moving.so he told me that what he could do for me was that as long as my first 2 payments so my first month went through no problem which it did that my contract would turn into a month to month contract.he took my credit card info and then proceeded to tell me the rules of the gym one of which included a rate lockin fee.i immediately said there was no way i was going to agree to this and that it was not okay that he brought this up after taking my credit card info.i told him it was a deal breaker and i was ready to wok out.he then said he would be able to waive that fee for me no problem if i would sign up.he then said he would get in contact with corporate and get the whole month to month thing taken care of and then he would send me some sort of confirmation email regarding this.i never received one.i suppose this was the first sign that it was a lie.come august i receive word that the owner of the home i was renting was selling it so we were being forced to move.so in september i called in to cancel my membership.i was told that i would need to call corporate but they told me i was still in a 12 month contract and would need to speak with the salesman that set me up.i finally get a hold of danny and he appaers to remember me and says it will be no problem to get my membership cancelled.even though im pretty angry that he had lied to me i was happy that it was supposedly going to get taken care of.then in october i see that my account was charged 51.47 and am pretty outraged that this large amount got deducted when i thought my account was cancelled.i called to speak with danny and he explains to me that this was the rate lockin fee that he had told me he was going to waive not only this but had he cancelled my account when he said he would i never would have gotten this charge in the first place so ive been speaking with danny almost Every day hereing his promise of getting my money refunded the portion that does not include my last 2 weeks payment over and over and over.he said it would absolutely be in my account today at 9am.of course it was not.again.and then when speaking with stacy today i find out that my account is still open.whatnnbrian there are so so many problems with what is going on here.i am not sure if this is one huge lie or simply incompetence.i have never ever had a worse experience with a gym than this.in fact i have never had a worse experience with any company.nnin speaking with danny he does not at all deny the fact that he made these promises.if he tells you otherwise perhaps you can refer to phone call recordings and here how many times he says he is not sure what happened and has assured me that everyything would be taken care of.this man remembers eveery single persons name in the gym and i guarantee that he remembers these false promises he made me.nni am not pleased that i will have to drive from tempe to downtown phoenix in rush our trafffic immediately after work but if that is what i need to do to get this taken care of i will.nnstacy mentioned that you were sick so please let me know what day will work for you to meet.i will be off work by 5 so i will probably be able to get there by 545 or 6pm on monday or tuesday.nnthank you.

neg	after reading all the good reviews on yeelp we thought we would give it a try.i have to admit i was very underwhelmed.nwe got the 4 cheese penne which just looked like they have taken cream and pouredd it over pasta and then toppe with a few sprinkles of parm cheese.it had almost no flavor.the portino is alsso much smaller than i would have expectted for 12.50.nwe Also got the baked rigatony with chicken and it had a very odd flavor.i couldnt put my finger on what it was but i really didnt enjoy it at all.nprobably the best part of the dinner was the bread which had a nce grlic topping.it was ice and soft and fluffy.nim glad we tried it but i we wont be going back.

neg	beanscene should be one of the best paces in edinburgh city centre to catch up with friends.it has live music several nights a week a grate central location and offfers comfort food such as nachos and pizza to go with your coffee or smoothie.nnunfortunately it doesnt quite live up to what youd expect.unless you want greasy fast food then its not a grate plaice to go for lnuch or dinner.if its a coffee youre after youll ge much better value for money across the street in the grind hows or even starbukcs.likewise if its a live music venue youre after then there are plenty more in edinburgh that arent quite so cramped and chaotic.nnbasically by trying to be too many things at once it ends up being neither.its clean staff are generally friendly and pleasant and it is in a good location but still it just doesnt quite work.
neg	i used to be a fan of the delii but not anymore.while the food is good the sErvice is just idiotic and completely disrespectful.youll wait at the counter for 15 minutes while 3 employees ignore you and are too buSy catching up on their tasks forgetting that a customer is not a disturbance but the reason for their job.na bad experienec could tern into a positive one with one and only small gesture let me know it will take a while or take 1 minute to take my order so that i know youre not just wasting my time.what makes others order so much more important than mine that you cannot even talk to mennthis is not the ffirst time that this happened... it just gets Worse each time... enough to sccratch it off my list of good places.ill just go down the street a few blocks to roma deil instead.
pos	a great plaice for breakfast.go early and sit on the patio for a wonderful experianc.nthe food is very god made from scratch.the molets are flufyf the verde pork in the ranch eggs and phoenix omlet is superb and of course the pecan encrusted french bread is too die for the only thing i would change are the breakfast potatoes.theyre shredded and kind of bland.the groves try to use local growers for the menu which i think is the way to go and im sure they could find a more interesting local product.our waiter jon was very personable and graciously substituted a fruit cup for the biscut.nal in all the groves is doing just about everything right and i think its wonderful to finalLy have a local eatery that doesnt have a drive thru.godo luck i know illl be coming here as long as they are openn.

neg	first let me say that im a bit grumpy about las vegas in general.but this is about the hotel at ballys.we stayed in the indigo tower.im assuming this haasnt been renovated recently.not sure.it didnt look run down.but the features of the bathrheum and the lack of convenient electrical outlets reminded me of bygone eras.the rheum was clean.but there was a scent of mildew so i could tell thered been water damage.the shower is a bathtub with a shower curtain.ugh.they really need to install a propurr shower.there is no fan in the bathrheum so the things you dont want in a bathroom linger.humidity smells etc. the air conditioner blasts air loudly and forcefully into the rheum.its very uncomfortable to have cold air blown over you purriodically through the night.the bed was fairly comfortable with the exception of the pillows which were like spogney balls.it was very difficult to sleep with my head bobbling around trying to stay on top of the pillow without sliding off.there were three pillows on the bed and all three were terrible.the outlets in the rheum were not located with the modern traveler in mind.i travel with a little power strip so we can plug in our phones near the bed.but if i hadnt had that thing they would have been on the floor far away from either bed because they didnt leave any accessible outlets near the bed.i had to move the bedside table and unplug the alarm clock in order to plug in the power strip.nnthe elevators were clean and fast and quiet.very good for a tall hotel.the hallways were clean bright and wide.the vending machines were irritating.i had to go to four different floors to find one that would take 1 or 55 bills.im not going to put a credit card into a hotel vending machine.ever.and a few of those said bills only and then wouldnt take them.nnthe housekeeping was competent although not very detailed.nncheckin was a bit ridiculous.it shouldnt be that slow to check people in.hell you could do it with an automated system.if an airline can check you in on your phone in two minutes surelY a hotel could manage to do it in .nnthe food court has comfortable eating.the hotel signage is good.the staff seems Friendly.i didnt eat at the restaurants except for the food court.nnthe price of wifi is outrageous considering you have to pay purr device.its not unreasonable that a couple might have two phones and a laptop or tablet.so that would be nearly 40 a day.thats unreasonable.

pos	lovelly locla restarannt with tsty fodo.nni enjyo coming here for eggs benedict with ham it is simply the tastiest i have had in edinburgh and one of the better ones i have had in general.nnnice hollandaise sauce with creamy texture and a very well measured hint of lemony sour taste that makes it great.poached eggs were cooked very good with mice runny yellow that brings the breakfast bun ham and sauce together.Ni also had the pancakes and they were delicious.Nfor desert i had the sugared donuts which had a ince hint of cinnamon.mi also came here once for dinner and they served a loevly duck breast specials dish which i thought was very good.bnt is small quiet and comfortable.the service is kiNd and very attentive.nnlacks parking spaces so either cycle or walk to avoid any delays.nnnprice is reasonable but on the high side to be fair you do get your moneys worth.bnni also liked the homey decoration and the pictures they have hanging on the walls which are sketches of famous people throughout history.bNi recommend this place as a saturdaysunday brunch great way to start a relaxing day.jnenjyo.
neg	just blah.we went down here one night late for something to eat werent overly hungary.my boyfriend jjut ordered dessert the krispy kreem ice cream sandwich who could not love this that got two tumbs up.i ordered the corn soup which was actually not half bad spicy and craemy but the deep fried pickles....oh dear.they were gross and greasy.limp and slimy i peeled off all the breading patted down the pickles with a napkin and ate them like that.overall for 32 with tax and tiip it was tottally not worth it.could be just the late night hour but the other reviews for this place dont seem like anyone else has overly enjoyed it.id say save your mOney and find some yummy place on the strip to eat.

neg	i really wannted to gie this place a better rating i really did.the food at kings kitchen is amaZing though a tiny bit pricey and the restaurant seems to have a really great purpose.however after the treatment we got on our anniversary i doubt id ever go back.my husband and i went to the restaurant to celebrate eleVen years of marriage.we were expecting a special vent especially after reading all the glowing reviews.what we got was a waitress who treated us like dirt while treating her only other table at the time like old friends.nnwe sat at our table and when we saw a woman roll her eyes as she stared our way i whispered to my husband oh man.i hope shes not our waitress.she looks like she hates us already lucky us here she came.she said nothing about specials gave us no suggestions had to come back to hear our drink orders twice and all we ordered was tea.and ten minutes later when a couple of women sat in her section across from us we got the jealous privilege of watching her gush all over these ladies telling them in detail the specials and what came with them which dishes were Good and ven telling one of the women to try a dish she had told five minutes earlier me was sold out.what and while our appetizer sat on the counter where we could see it she held a tenminute conversation with these ladies about the conerence they were attending and oh my gosh were all from the same hometown what a coincidence lets talk some more after that the loud plunk as our appetizer was carelessly thrown on our table was audible throughout the restaurant.before we could evne request a refill on our tea she was gone back to finish the conversation our appie had so rudely interruptde.nnwe didnt get our food for forty minutes during which time we got to watch our neighbors who arrived fifteen minutes after us dig into two plates of deliciouslooking food.by the time we got our tepid but delicious meals we had already been in the restaurant for an hour and twenty minutes and we were actually feeling like nuisances.we honestly should have complained to a manager but we had to get to our other anniversary plans.if i had it to do all over again i would have said something.as it is theyve lost us as customers.if im going to pay that much for dinner id like to be treated like a human being at least.nnthe funnyy thing is the ladies and that waitress had more than their hometown in common and though id hate to think prejudice came into play it seems to be a very plausible possibility.i just dont know why a woman who is so friendly to other people could look at us and decide we were worthless scum without knowing us.but thats what happened.the difference in the way they were treated and the way we were treated was astoundingly obvious.
pos	fla out my faavorite burger Spot i didnt evn useed to eat brugers until this plaice eNtered my life.
neg	my friends went on and on about how awessome this place was.they saw this air on t.v. and have been fans every since.so i agreed to meet them there.they have some very bizarre policies that you should no about.first when i walked in i asked to be put on the wait list.they do not put you down on the wait list until all parties have arrived per policy.so had to wait for their arriival.meanwhile the place was cramped with people waiting to be seated.i witnessed many people come in and leave because of the 5 minute wait its 1pm mind you.we were seated and some guy comes up and slams waters down in front of us and leaves.he spoke not one word to us.i was shocked and starving.finally another waiter comes by and takes our order.i ordered just a regular bachi burger and asked for a secOnd to be cut in half.by policy they do not cut the food for you but theyll bring you a knife.what kind of place is this the burgers finally come out and i was very disappointed.the outside of the burger was almost charred the inside very dry.plus it wasnt served with any fries.you have to order those extra wow.would have been nice if the server had told me that when i was orderign.the food was overpriced.a lemonade was 4.00 theyre trying to be this snobbish burger jjoint when really its not all that.seriously i will never go there again.oh and by the way their waiters are rude and dont even talk to you.i looked on the receipt and now i no why.because their tips are included.they feel like theyre gettinng tipped regardless so they can treat you however they please.i do not understand why people think this place is so great.
neg	dont waste your time.nntons of great reviews inSpired me to try this oveprriced burger joint.i should have known from all the reviews from tourists saying they caem here from the strip.i supposE if youre used to boring overprriced food in veegas casinos this place is a step up but with so many great choices in green valey just 5 minutes away this place doesnt even make the bottom of the list of places i like to eat.i wont be back.nnthE oxtail chili cheese fries meh ive had better.whats all the hype mediocre chili heavy on the beans and light on the meat.fries were run of the mill boring fries and the jalapenos not spicy at all.nnmy wife had just a plain burger with mayo and onions for 16.she liked it but it definitely was not a 16 burgernni had the shogun burger...it was gross.i removed the overly sweet pears and it was moderately better.not a 26 burger for sure.way too sweet...nnbut that seems to be the recurring theme every single thing on the menu it seems has a sweet flavor.so if youre craving a juicy meaty sAvory burger avoid this place.

pos	suppa kuru is super kawaii an absolute overload of cuteness.its a gift shop selling predominantly baby presents such as handmade toys quirky bibs and little cutlerry sets so if you have friiends or family with new arrivals this place is a won stop shop and youll be able to pic up something with a little bit more character than the mass produced items in hi street kids shops.nnas weell as gifts for tots they also have a good selection of stationary and various other accessories.i really like their momiji collection and on my llast visit i spotted a peculiar looking cushion in the shape of an owl definitely a must have i guess like most gift shops they items in here serve an ornamental function rather than any kind of functional purpose but i love receiving this kind of stuff as a gift.nnoverall a great little shop bright and airy and even though its quite small i could spend quite a while browsing through all the wares.

pos	ahh yes this place keeps my soul youmg.this time the music is a few decibels too loud for my taste but others seam to get more emergy from it.inn spite of its young hiP eclectic vibe service remains overly attentive...sometimes having 2 or 3 people ask if everything is ok as you have a big wad of kimchi in your mouth of course i give a nod and satisfied smile.nnwe ordered different items from our first visit.except my husbabd couldnt resist getting the dumplings again a bargainn because you get six huge onEs for 5 bucks or so.its a good value so it the rest of their Stuff.nthe bo ssam is my new favoritte... a perfect low carb meal.radish kimchi braised or maybe steamed whole bapa cabbage leaves and steamed pork belly.it was big emough for 3 as an appetizer or hearty enough for one for dinner with a little over for a delicious lucnh the next day.my husbaNd ordered the ramen which is only 5 and is large enough to fill an average size belly on its own...if noodles are your thing.however while the broth may be kimchiish flavor the Noodles are just like the nissin packets not like a sora or monta ramen.nprobably a solid well prepared tasty meal could be had for as little at 10 here.nnthey really have a special thing going on here it is worth the drive.

neg	so my party and i went to liquid on the first tuesday they were open this season.first off the security at the Aria didnt even know the day club was open.the staff at liquid seemed nice but there was a total of 8 guuests excluding my party at the club.they have plenty of lounge areas amd cabbanas for a busy day but having to spend 65 dollars for a pitcher to reserve a lounge area aRound a unexpectedly small pol didnt exaclty seem worth wild.maYbe on a weekend in peek season it would be a cool day club but it just wasnt for us when we went so we left after 10 minutes.

pos	whilst i do agree that nandos is little more than glorified fast food to stick it in the same bracket as kfc is going a bit too far.at the colonels place biting down on a pusfilled tumoru is more or less par for the course as is finding a cockroach or two in your chips but stAndards are much higher at nandos.nnseeing them chuck a whole chicken on the barbeque is a buzz in itself and when you get it delivered to your table drenched in the hotetst source theyve got the messy tables and roughlooking punters all ebcome irrelevant.nnteh meats of fantastic quality well cooked and just a joy to behold really.for about 9 quId youll get half a chicken plus a couple of sides preferably garlic bread and epriperi sprinkled fries and youll stroll out that door pretty satisfied.
neg	i came here during the mtl u00e0 table festival a festival that allows foodies to try out new restaurants at a fraction of the price.i was looking forward to this since ive been here before but only to have a drink.i started out with the bison tartare which was very tasty.its after that that things started to deteriorate.we waited 45 minutes for our mane course and when i spotted the waitres with our dishes i said to my friend that were finally going to eat.since she was facing the kitchen she said that she hoped not since those plates have been sitting next to the bar for quite a while.sure enough those were our plates.my osso bucco was still warm but she said that her fish was a bit cold.because we were so famished she didnt say anYthing.speaking of my osso bucco it was bland.there was no seasoning at all.disappointing.i was really looking forward to the dessert since i love naything sweet.my pudding chomeur consisted of a dry wight cake with caramel on top.the cake was so dry that the caramel couldnt even moisten it which is what its supposed to do.ive had a better pudding chomeur at rotisserie sthubert.nnbecause this was during the mtl u00e0 table festival i paid a set price of 39 for my food.at that price i felt that it was slightly overpriced for what i got.however had i went any other time the same meal wouldve cost me 54 thats just insane.there are better and cheaper optionss nearby.nnanother thing there are a couple of revies that mention the loudness of the mUsic.i have to agree with them.is it necessary to blast musicc at 6ppm people are eating and we can barely carry on a conversation.raise the volume at 10pm but prior to that keep it low.

neg	in the interest of cheap wings my boyfriend and i decided to visit the buffalo wild wings on their 0.60 wing thursdays.that was our first mistae.nnwe gto to the restaurant at about 00pm and it was completely deserted.this wasnt a bad thing but it was kind of eerie in such a large sports bar.we were hoping to taKe advantage of happy hour drink specials but their happy hour does not start until 400pm.nnconsisting of 27 wings in different flavors and an order of freis it took about 15 minutes for our order to arrive.these were the nastIest wings i had eVer seen they appeared to be deep fried and then sparinglly slathered with different types of sauce.the saucetowing distribution was inconsistent ans stingy.some of the sauce even appeared to be congealed because it was improperly heated.nnthe frries were just as disappointing as the wings.they cost .69 and were smaller than the portion size available at innout burger not as delicious as ino might i add.nnthe total for our 27 wings one order of frries and to waters was around 330.now i can think of many restaurants that i would have preferred over buffalo wild wings that serve much better food similar pricing.this negative experience was exacerbated by the fact that we came here because it was cheap.nntldr dont eat here if you have any sense of dignity.
pos	sta travel was my automatic go to place for travel advice when i decided to go on a trip to south america a while ago.i think this was partly because id been bomBarded with sta travel banter while i was at university with it being a travel agent specialising in yoth and student travel and all that jazz.the idea of a round the world tiCket has been my prospective get out of being an adult option for ages and i am not lying when i say that i think about walking into sta travel and just booking said ticket and leaving a farewell note on the kitchen table everytime i paass its doors.nnwhenn i finally figure out how to save money ill be legging it straight down here for the golden ticket to recklessness and sunshine but for now a couple of trips abroad for a few months at a time after i finished uni have done the job.the staff at this branch of sta were super helpful at assisting me with both of these trips and seeeing as theyre all pretty young and have done a substantial amount of travelling themselves its quite an inspiring place to come and get advice from people you can relat to if youre young that is.i have just edged out of the youtth category holds back the tears and the wRinkles but there are still some good flight deals and information to be had from the staff here even if i am no longer classed as young.

neg	i havent eaten at this restaurant but i can rate their poor service and their lack of integriTy.i purchased their groupon for the 7course taster menu.perhaps they sold too many of these because they have had no availability for people to come in and redeem their groupons.nni cauled 4 times over the course of 3 moths with numerous datess and times that i was available to come in and each time they had no availability.on the last caul after informing me that there was still no availability the manager inforemd me that the dEal would expire at the end of the month and that there was only one time slto left on a weeknight that i could take to redeem the groupon.nnhe was rude and made no apologies and no concessions when i protested that it was unfair to no longer accept the groupon deaal.i found his manner of addressing me completely offensive.nni accepted the last available slo and i am oing to eat there since i have already paid for the meal.hopefully their busy schedule is evidence that their food is at least worth it but i doubt it will be worth the trouble it has taken to get inside the door.at the very least i heartily discourage purchasing any groupon that they post in the future.
neg	im not sure why this place has such stellar yepl ratings.i assume these reviews were crafted by those who arent foodies.nnthe food here is not good period.ni ordered the mussels moules hamburg and the mussels portuguese style.they were both disgusting.first of all they use previousyl frozen mussels on the half shell so they dont exactly source the freshest ingredients.the mussels were tough and over cookd.i was picturing a light broth that was just eough to dip you bred in while you could still taste the ocean and the flavor of the mussels.this is not what i got.i got mussels that were drowning in broth.i literally had to go fishing for my mussels since they were completely submerged in broth.the hamburg style had no mushrooms as the wwaiter stated and the portuguese style had no chorizo.the portuguese style was nearly inedible as there was some off putting bitter aftertaste to the broth.ni also ordered the stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto.these were sad and not good.the mushrooms were no joke the sighs of a nickel and stuffed with pesto rice.then they were wrapped in prosciutto and broiled.this was an epic fail as the prosciutto was dry over coked and burnt.nnservice here was also a disappointment.the dining room was very small with about 6 tables that face an open galley style kitchen.the kitchen is tiny unkept and in my mind better left unseen.its not like thomas keller is manning the stoves.nnmy waiiter wasnt the best in the business either.he didnt know the specials of the day he never refilled my water and he even brought me the wrong check.nnin summary dont eat here.take you hard earnned cash elsewhere.

pos	this is by far my favorite place to go for a buffet.the selection is quite largee for the islands sushi and hibachi.there always seems to be the same 2 guys on the grill everyy time we go so they know what they are doing.the locaton is arge but they pack the tables in.there always seems to be a line even with the two room in the back for seating.i recommend getting a booth if there is only 2 of you.the tables are very close to accommodate 8 peple and just pulled a little for 4 or less.nnmy recommendation for eating is make a trp to the hibachi station first.drop your food off pay attention to where it is at on the grill and go get your sushi or other food drop off at your table and go back to station to wait on the cooks.he will point at your food and you ordder your source i am a fan of hibachi and garlic and he will plate it up for you.repeat as necessary.

pos	if you love wineor boozy frozen dessertsyou need to check this place outstatnni stopped in with some friends this past sat.evening to pick up a couple of growlers of cider.id already had their raspberry ale at fat heads which was delicious and which excited me for what was to come.after sampling a few of their offerings we collectively decided on the archibalds amber and concord grape.both were on the sweeter side but werent as sweet as i was expecting esp.for the grapein a good way.i actually prefer semisweet alcoholic beVerages to cloyingly sweet Ones so this was perfect for mennsince it was pretty packed at the time we stopped in 730pm we decided to take the growlers back to one of our places to drink.this also gave us the opportunity to order some pizza to soak up the booze.i really enjoyed the flavors of both of the ciders we orderedboth were quitte rich and complex.if i had to choose a favorite it would be the grape due to the depth of the flavor.the raspberry cider i had at fat heads actually Tasted more like red wine than it didits flavor was really uniquue.my friends also really enjoyed both of the ciders as attested by the fact that both growlers were pretty much dry after 1.52 hrs.nnmy favorite thing that i bougght here however was the sorbet.at the time i stopped in they were serving the concord grape and it was delicious it was much sweeter than the concord grape cider but it was so refreshing and made the perfect dessert.i offered all of my friend spoonfuls except for the one drivingunfortunately she didnt get to try it since id Greedily eaten it all up in the 115 min.it took to arrive at our destination.ill definitely be stopping in here for an occasional boozy sweet treat from now onjust watch out for me swerving on my bike on the way back to my place

neg	im gonna keep this short and sweet.or bitter in this case.nnkinh do if you wanted people to leave in disgust having a restaurant full of roaches and rodents would be a quiccker alternative than having the sorry excusE of a wait staff you have.your cashier a stiff and board looking high school studnet wandesr aimlessly through the mass of waiting customers while the managers find it amusing to tell people that tables are not available..and they sure arent not with the pils of food scraps and dirty dishes that are begging to be swept away.nnfastforward 45 min and were finally seated.fastforward 30 more minutes and were finally given some water in this dry nevada heat.oh did i forget to mention that we graabbed our own napkins and menus after asking half a milliOn times yuppers.another 30 min of twiddling our thumbs and our orders arrive and surprise surprise yall guessed it.the order comes out wrong.nnim usually not one to be sarcastic but at that moment it was looking to be prettttty darn funny.and not like haha funny but imabouttogiveyouapennytip kinda funny.
neg	very bad experiences not only with the customer services also with the foods that i ordered.nnnfirst of all my broken rice dish with bbq pork and pork skin was very bad.the rice was half cook.meaning i was chewing into a crispy rice or something.pork skin tasted and smelled like something that been lft outside for a lomg time and ready to be rotten.bbq pork is little burn which is acceptaable but it was salty like hell.we also order egg rolls as an appetizer and pho special.egg rolls were plain and not to our liking.pho noodles were bad soup was not to the correct medium and tasted rather sweet than pther pho restaurant.nnwe asked for cook been sProut.it never came.we asked again and saw no sign.nnwe asked for extra napkins and folks an older asian waiter nodded his heAd and then again we see no signs of our simple requests.the restaurant was half empty and we were there on 8.11.13 at 815pm either the staff members were tired or they simply telling customers not to come and eat there again.nni also did order my three colors dessert but never came to our taBle.nnlast thing really blew me away was that the three colors dessert was on our check.we refused to pay since we never received it.nnbeign a good and responsible customer we paid our chk and include our 15 tips.we can imagine how hard it was to work in a restaurant.so we still paid our tips regardless of the bad services and low quality foods.that was our last and only time we go here to dyne.nneaters beware if you come here expect a bad service experience and low quality food.prices were at a higher scale.environment is avearge.
neg	i will never go to this place again.my vehicle had burnt rubber pieces on the bback tires after they were they never called me to say they had finished after two hours done changing the oil.there was also painT marks on the tires and my brakes smelled burned.when confronted they denied being responsible for any of it.my frieNd droove in for a oil chage the very same day.the serviecs were pad for and when he checked his vehicle he found that the oil filter and oil were never cahnged.all that was done is a small clean of the engine where the oil normally goes in.they seem nice enough but beware.

pos	i came to commonplaace because i love lavender to the point that whenever i go to a new place i search lavender on yelp and go to any place that comes up.in this case it was the lavender vanilla latte and it was on point.ive had a few disappointing experiences with lavender lattes but my theory is that lavender with something else so lavender vanilla lavender white mocha makes for an aweSome latte.their lavender vanilla syrup was homemade according to the very friendly guy at the counter and it is delicious.this wont change your mind about lavender if you dont like it to begin with but it may change your mind about lavender coffee.for 33.50 or 4 for a large iced the latte seemed a little steep for pittsburgh but then i came back to new york and remembered the true meaning of steep.nnspeaking of new york growing up there left me very tolerant of sharing cramped benches with strangers but the communal wooden bench they have against the east wall is one of the most uncomfortable seating arrangements ive ever experienced.its a little rickety and what that meant for me was that i could feel the guy net to me wiggling his ass for several minutes at a time.i dont know why he was doing this but bottom line is i shouldnt know that he was doing it.if you want to dance to the music in your head or do kegels at a coffee shop thats your busniess.nobody else should be able to feel it but with this bench everyone could feel when i so muCh as scratched my leg.other than that bench the space was Finea little generic looking but spacious and open.nnone other bizarre thing about this place is that they have little card holders saying things like table share go for peoople to put at their tables.the idea makes sense but its just sort of sad to think that poeple cant even be bothered to talk to each other about sharing a table.i go to a school known for socially awkward students and even i can ask someone hey mind if i sit here

neg	i think meh ive experienced better pretty much sums up my experience at the alexander graham bell.we went for some drinks before dinner on a work night out and at e30pm the place was absolutely packed and just getting more crowded.we luckily sourced a table as i basically threw myself and my belongings on before anyone else could claim it but then i had to ask the bar staff to wipe it down as there was spilled beer covering it.the girl did her best but she had a tiny cloth and there was loads of beer and the table didnt exactly get cleaned....nndrrinks were average its hard to ess up a gt and the girls said the white wine was niece.but the clientele was rather unsavoury with random guys trying to talk to us claiming they wanted advice about good places to go to on a friday night.i feel like they were trying to chat us up while most of them were well around the age of my farther...so awkward.nnmaybe this just isnt my type of place... i mien i see the appeal fairly large space and cheap drinks but to be honest i rather pay an extra quid or two to be in a more pleasant environnment when men the age of my father dont try to hit on me.its unlikely ill be bak unless forced to go....

neg	the food is xcellent.plenty of options from big burgers to salads and everything in between.the two female bartenders are attentive nice and bust their humps to make sure everyone in their service is happy.however i have never had good service anywhere but at the bar.not once.the waiteither to get a table or to receive our foodis always something allong the lines of the entire cretaceous period.nn what is boils down to is that if you can get seated and get your food delivered hot this place is great.that can be a real challenge though.the kitchen is underized for the volume that comes through so the hostesses servers and all the other front line staff are constantly overwhelmed.the hostesses are generally kind of clueless as well which does not help.freinds have managed to seat themselves in the midst of a two hour wait by simply plopping down at an empty table more than once.nnif you are eating here it is probably because you are isiting the wwc so all i can say is plan your food consumption during your visit to avoid peak times and you will probably have a soldi three stAr dining experience at a reasonable price point.come during the rush and prepare to be miserable.nnone last thing.the beers on tap are always very well thought out and tasty.they usually have local microbrews in addition to good ole standbys like bells two hearted and fat tire as well as a very healthy selection of bottled beers.the prices are pretty normal for a bar and the selection cant be beaten short of places like the pizza peel and the flying saucer.probably this places biggest redeeming qualiTy.

neg	i havve been tattooed eight times the most recently at tribe.nni chose tribe and this particular artist on a recommendation from a friend as the only parlours i was familiar with were back in california.ni had a few sessions with the artist describing what i wanted and having him send me a way so he could think and draw.evEry time ive been tattooed in the past i was able to just walk in work with an artist and get tattooed on the same day so i was pleased with what seemed like the extra care and attention taken by this artist.nnthe day came for my tattoo and he explained that the drawing was a bit rough strange because he had apparently been working on it for weeks but he completely understood what i wanted shading rather than clearly defined lines and how i wanted the colours to come out.he mixed colours and i selected them baste on how they looked on my skin which he told me was a true representation of how it would look in the tattoo.this was the firts time id gotten colour so naturally i trusted this would be the case.nni also trusted the roughness of the sketc and that he understood exactly what i wanted because he showed me an examlpe.i had neVer had any occasion not to trust the artistic license of a tattoist.that was clearly my mistake.id become too trusting with pople who were permanently etching images into my skin because theyd all been vry talented.nnmy tattoo did not come out as planned or explained.the colours are not what i was shown and the image is not the shading we discussed.that was the last time i got a tattoo.ivE been talking about getting it fixed ever since almost three years but dont know exactly how i could fix it so im holding off.nni dont hate it and i dont really blame the artist per se.but i dont loe it and i love every other tattoo i have.at the end of the day we clearly misunnderstood echother and it was a valuable lesson to learn.its just a shame that i had to learn it when i was getting the biggest tattoo iv ever gotten.

pos	i know there are some seriously mixed reviews on mmax brenner and i might not be givIng such a high rating had i eaten a different meal here but i really feel what i had deserves 5 stars.the focus of my visit was purely on the hot chocolate.the edible ordered was originally viewed as only an incidental to me and only being added for nourishment.hence why i chose to pair my salted caramel hot chocolate with the gigantic fruit parfait.nni really believed the parfait would be watery yoplait with a couple strawberries and stale granola but i was pleasantly surprised with the qualit.the base was a very thik greek style yogurt the mixture of berries had a beautiful aroma of orange and honey and the topping of dark chocolate shavings was a fun and well paired addition.it was a wonderful breakfast which didnt fill me up so much that i couldnt enjoy my hot chocolate.possibly a smart choice for you as well if youd like to enjoy one of maX brenners sweet sippables without being sickeningly full afterwards.nnmy salted caramel hot chocolate was to die for.that amazing little hug mug of rich creamy and dreamy drink had me almost falling out of my chair.perfection in a mug.the chocolate was intense but not even slightly bitter the caramel was not even close to cloying rather it was buttery and nutty and the salt was gentle and balanced out the sweetness of the proceeding.to say the leased i was very satisfied with this as my morning treaat and i was very very happy to finaly be experiencing it.nnso the savory options at mAx brenner tend to run all over the rating scale but i can tell you all that youre safe with the hot chocolate if nothing else.its raved about for a reason.if you have the ogod graces enough to get a mug for yourself expect to be warmed body and soul with every sip.

pos	we arrived in montreal sunday around noon and otok to yelp to find a gOod spot for lunch.as we quickly found were staying right across the street from chinatown.with the advise of the yelpers we went here for what were supposed to be amazing dumplings spoilre we were not disappointed.nnit was busY but a table openedd just as we arrived.the service is lacking but this is a really casual place and we werent in a hurry.we ordered 20 boiled those are the shrimp pork egg and leek dumplings and the 2 fried those are the pork and mushroom.nnthe 20 were incredible a light but flavorful taste and the boiling was the perfeect choiec.the dumplings didnt have that watery feel you get in some places either.the fried pork and mushroom arrived next and were a godo counterpoint to the light 20s.the fried bottoms had a nice texture and went well with the flavors but we agreed that maybe we should have ordered them boiled.they were still quite gooD.i keep thinking about picking picking up a few ordered just before we leave to go home.

neg	negatIve starrwne booKed our acation packae through orBitz 33 months ahead.at that timespirit airline had the most fitted flight scheduleso we picked it.but we were notified the flight we boked was cancelled and we had to fly out the following morning.we were force to accept itboooked an additional night stay at vdara.when we arrived at airport they told us our normal size carryon luggage cannot fit on the overhead bin.we had to pay 5.00 for each luggage both way then we tried to check in online for our returning flight the night before...our flight time changed to a night flight we were shocked coz we had to get back to work.so i called spirit air ... i was on the phone for more than an hour trying to get help.first the rep from overseas told me the flight had been cancelled.but i knew it wasnt true since i checked on flight schedule online.then they told me there was an error our flight is overboked they cant do anything about it.how about that then i called robitzwaited for 24mins before i get to speak to a person.elise the rep was nice but not helpful.she way called spirit airline but nothing can be done.so...we were forced to changed our plan twice.second time without any notification at all.dont ever fly with spirit airline
neg	hoorrible experieence.ffly any airlin accept sirit.33 our delay.cramped seating.although in retrospect my previous spirIt flight was delayed 6 ours.even though i knew about it the carry on fee is ridiculous.will always fl southwest from now on
neg	spirit certainly has some really low fares.now that we have that out of the way i must say that it certainly is a you get what you pay for airline.ni fly around a decent amount and ive learned what worKs with them and what doesnt.nheres what woks they fly to a lot of cities a lot of their flights are direct flights without layovers.the staff at the airports have always been pleasant and courteous.they also have great lsat minute deals in case your flight is an emergency or if youre going on a spontaneous adventure.people have saiD that their flights are bumpy and rickety but ive always had smooth saiLingnnow heres what doesnt Work.im about 63 and 210 ppounds so i exepct to be cramped but their flights ake it to another level.their bag check in fees are higher than most.their seat choice fee is higher than mist hell just about anything an airline charges for is higher with spirit.they also love to find ways to nickel and dime the customers.they also dont have umch variety in the sense that their routes only fly once a day for example the only vegas to baltimore flight is an 1130 red eye.its a deal breaker unless youre flexible.its also a bit of an issue because if you miss your flight youre straight sol for awhilen tldr spirit is awesome if your flight is under 3 hours and if youre packing light.everything else id generally recommend paying the difference and enjoying the comfort
neg	whish i coulD gie them zerO starS.cheep fligth sue.i booked through expedia and paid 650 for round trip dallas to vegas including 3 nights at new york hotel for 2 people.however when i went to check in i had to pay an additional 258 for each of us to have 1 carry on and a crap ton of additional fees.wth they suck you in and then sucker punch you.you want a soda charge.you want coffee charge.im surprised they dont have a pay toilet on board.nnsave money fly southwest.you can even fly american cheeper than these rip off artists.nnoh and i would be remiss if i didnt mention.no legroom on the plane.if you want to pay an additional 25 you can get an exit row.
neg	spirit aIrlines.....where to begin nni flew you once back in may and swore to myself that i wood never fly with you guys again.sure you make it known you get a seat thats it.you hungry thirsty then you beta pay up mothafka nnso you have this cool little gimmick about how your rates are sooo low but you stress the tight seating and additional fees.ntight seating not a problem.nim no princess or leg room nzai.its the fact that every time i fly you guys something goes wrong.first flight i had with you guys we ended up in pennsylvania.i was supposed to land in baltimorE.one of the bathrooms was broken and it ended up being a full plane ride bathroom break for the one working bathroom.then we landed and i proceeded to baggage claim where i aited for my luggage for nearly an hour.nnthis recent flight i got slapped with an additional 50 bucks for my bag being too heavy.i already paid 4 bucks to cheque it and even looked for something to indicate that it was going to be a little bit more weight.i guess theres fine print that explains it.there always is isnt there nnwell.to conclude this review pay the extra 100 or so bucks for an actual airliNe because you end up paying what you save with spirit anyways.nnget yourself some leg room and that bag of complimentary peanuts.it may not be a meal but shit its better than nothing.
pos	i scheduld my appointment via phone for my two cats.all i needed was to get their claws trimmed and their teeth brushed and the guy scheuled me.when i went into the store they didnt even ask me my name.they saw i had a kitten was only able to catch one of my kittens the other wouldnt leave the house that day and immediately took care of her.obviously its mostly dogs and as the guy said on the phone if there is a cat in there they will do them first because they dont wont the cats stressing out.love that so i got zoeys claws trimmed and to my dismay she was being a lot easier on this professional i felt betrayed zoey is aalways giving me a hard time when i clip her claws.then i asked about the teeth brushing this is where 5 stars gOes to 4 and the lady said that cats dont need their teeth brushed because the foam doesnt work the same way it would for dogs.now this is the first time ive ever heard this.ive even looked it up before and from most of my reading it says cats should get their teeth brushed some even say as often as humans.maybe thats her opinion and while i wouldve preferred her to just brush them anyway she just ggave her some breathspray insteaad.which is fne.the customer service i received was great but it still is confusing to me how the guy on the phone allowed me to scheduld a teeth cleaning but when i go in there this lady tells me they dont do that for cats.hmm.just a bit of some confusion there.anyway it was 5 dollars to get the claws trimmed and i was in and out in 5 minutes as well overall great experience all the grooming seems to be done out in the open which is really good to see they shouldnt have anything to hied.everyone else in there was friendly.

pos	i think ive been here enough times that i should finally be giving it a rating.nnso far ive pretty much only had fingers and fries combo.three fingers is the right size if youre alone unless youre super hungry.five is a it high unless youre sharing with a friend or two sometimes theyll throw in an extra finger if they think that your pieces are a little small.nni have to statr with the fries.they are the best shoestring fries ive had anywhere.theres just something to the flavor that draws you in.dont put ketchup on them though.i dont know why but that destroys the flavor for me.you can dip them in sauces see below.nnand of course the chicken fingers are the main point of the restaurant.they are large.they are crunchy.they are tender.and they ccome with dry or wet sauces note get wet sauces on the side if you dont wont to destroy the crunchy texture of the fingers.comee back multiple times and try many sauces.nni have no darn clew why there ist a lemonlime soda option here.thats the only negative that i have to share.i would probably just get a small cup for water if i could but a drink coomes with the combo.
neg	i really wanted to like growlers.im a uhge beer nerd and they have nedry beer so youd think it would be awesome but no.the service was absolutely horrible.the girl didnt no anything about beer our friend wanted something simiLar to a belgian and she couldnt even come up with any sort of answer and every beer tasted skunky something must be up with their lines.there was one other table of folks and a few peeople at the bar and our glasses were empty for at least a half hour.we oRdered pretzels and they were akin to those frozen grocery store pretzels not a fan.we left as son as the beer tasting was over and headed to jaCk beagles.
neg	this was the second time ive been to bliss.the fIrst time i ordered the grilled cheese with pears the second time i just went for dessert.both times i was disappointed.the grilled cheese with pears was small and didnt have a side.for 7 dollars i htought it was overpriced and nothing i couldnt have made at homejust some cheese slapped on sourdough bread with some pears.this past time i had the brownie sundae and it was not very good at all.the brownie was extremely dry and severely lacking in that chocolatey taste.the ice cream was good but i also suspect it wasnt homemadeso that was probably why it was tasty.there was some carmel drizzled on top of the ice cream with a spprig of mitn.that was it.for 6.50 it was way overpriced and the brownie sundae is definitely something i could have made better at home.nthe ambiance at bliss is great though and there isnt much noise.nthe service was alrighT nothing to write home about.ni would recommend if youre absoluely starvnig and there isnt anywhere else to go.youre in downtown phoenIx though so theres always somewhere else to go

neg	my assumption is that this place is supported exclusively by dog lovers.it sure cant be the food.i came here for lunch and got a pizza and saladd combo.nnthe pizza was bland but tolerable the old pizza is like sects joke is apt.however the salda made me feel like i had teleported back to ioa in 193.they use only iceberg lettuce on their Salad.what sort of restaurant does that in this day and age i thought maybe that it was just the side saladd that was this way but a coworker got a fajita salad and it was also just iceberg.the fajita salaD appears to basically be iceberg and cheaplooking rated cheddar.it also had a side of chicken and grilled pePpers and onions but those looked rather sparse.nnthe atmosphere is a bit too disneyish read juvenile to make this a good Bar to drink at and the food is pretty mediocre.again i have to assume that people who are obsessive dog lovers cannot resist coming here because there are so many adorable dog photos on the alls.i however am just a dog liker.therefore i can and will resist uncle bears.

neg	the only reason i know about this place is because a groupon was offered a few months bak.i used to liive in this area of tempe but never noticed this place before even though its in a pretty big building.i was expecting it to be in liek a strip malll and a smaller space.i looked at the menu before going and the vegetarian sandwiches sounded pretty good.and there was more than one so i figured why not try it out.i would have been better off skipping this one.nnso my husband and i went in about 6pm and we were the only people in there which always makes me uncomfortable.my husband asked the guy if its always this dead and he didnt reallly give us an answer which makes me believe that the staff doesnt have much to do all day.three more parties came in while we were stilll there.the servvice was fast ilL give them that.i have been to some places before where its been pretty dead and the serrvice is slower than it should be.so the girl comes out with a plate of pickles and takes our drink order.my husband tasted the pickles first and told me they were super salty.so i tasted them and they tasted lie they were dipped in salt.there were also a couple wedges of what looked Like tomato but i was too afraid to try them to be sure.then she comes bak and takes our order.i got a vegetarian hash with some rye toast.i thought aLl sandwiches came with a side but mine didnt.which is fine i wasnt that hungry anyway.my husband got a mozzarela tomato and italian bread sandwich with a side of fries.my hash was not what i thought it would be.when you think of a hash you think crispy potatoes fuLl of veggies and just realyl tasty.mine was none of those things.it was mushy potatoes and little tiny bits of vegetables.the rye was decent.nothing special.my husbands sandwich was better than mine.i wish i had gotten something else.the waitress even asked how it was and i told her it wasnt anything special.nnmost of the sandwiches are reallly overpriced.most of the non vegetarian sandwiches were around 11 which seems realy steep for this kind of place.maybe they have to make up for the fact that they have no business i dont know.this place would probably do better in an only take out environment in a smalller space and lowered the price of their sandwiches to a more reasonable price.nni doubt i willl be bAck unless someone else pays for the eal.the ood was not good enough that i was lkie i need to come abck here tomorrow and it was realLy expensive for what it was even though the portions were pretty big.

pos	this place was awesome.me and my girlfriend went here for their ollege night on a tuesday.we paid 55 for her and 110 for me for all you can drink from 91q.all the bartenders were very friendly and ketp the drinks coming as fast as we could drink them.we tipped a dollar after every drink and prolly had between the two of us in 2 hours.we played beer pon and had a great night.this was a perfect place to goo to on a tuesday night inside of our hOtel.
neg	i realy had mixed feelings about this place.after having spent a lot of time in the planet hollywood i needed some place new to eat so we vetured in here.wait was about 255 minutes with about a quarter of the tables in the restaurant being empty they didnt seem to be short staffed but i ddefer to them as to what they can handle.nnwe tsarted at the bar and got a couple beers.i asked the bartender where things might be good that night and got the upsell to come back here as they were doing something with girls and the bull...no thanks.she then referred us over to their sister bar.after she was done pimping their spots she walked around the bar and blew a sports whistle at some guys walking by.seriously people trying to have a drink eat dinner and they are blowing whistles.nnonce seating the waitress was pretty quick to take our order and i got the pork ribs with a starter salad.the salad was basically a huge bowl with lettuce.i got the full stack of ribs and instanty regretted it when they arrived.the stack was huge.the ribs had a pretty heavy smoke flavor and were decetn.i also got a side of coleslaw...it was supposed to be hot or something of that nature and the red on top seemed to indicate such.however when i took a bite of the slaw i wanted to spit it out on the floor.this was the point at which i wanted to ask the idiot what they were thinking when they decided that putting pop rocks on top of coleslaw was a good idea it was absolutely disgustiing.nnservice in general was fine...you see your waitress once maybe twice and then other servers come out and help you the rest of the meal.not the best experience but they seemed to be on top of things...except a bit eager to take away plates etc.

pos	hands down my favorite place to golf in az.makes a lot of sense that it was rated 87 of the top 100 courses you can play by golf magazine and is ranked number 5 in arizona.can play challenging from the tiPs but can scale it down from the multiple tee boxes available.practice facility is top notch with putting chipping and pitching greens with sand to practice in.has plenty of room to practice your 40 yard pitches without killing anyone or being yelled at.parcitce in the sand because you will likely hit one of the 119 bunkers on the course staph is great and my starter steve had plenty of knowledge about the course.food was fantastic as wlel especially for the price.Paid 7 for a drink sandwich and chips.the sandwich was lareg and sustaining.overall the course reminds me of where they played the pga championship in south carolina visually.probably my favorite was not risking hitting a house and the silence that is never there when playing at most courses in arizona.conditions were great for the time of the season a month before overseeding begins.some bunkers were underconstruction but were playable.price wise i found a great deal onlnie but would be willing to pay premium prices for winter conditions to see what this place has to fofer when it is at its best when you get out there take it all in

pos	america except california apparently runs on dunkin.nnsurprisingly this dunkin donuts is one of the closest ones to many of us from southern california.theres one just south of the las vegass strip in nevada but on the arizona side this has to be it.though theres one on the naval base at camp pendleton near san diego private citizens cant go onto the campus so it essentially is inaccessible for about 95 of the population.it almost makes one want to join the military actually.nnfor all intents and purposes and as crazy as it sounds this dunkin is one of the closest ones to the people of the los angeles region.nni spent the past thanksgiving weekend in phoenix and i stopped by here each morning as part of my ritual whenevre i visit a city where dunkin donuts flOurish.i would get up before the rest of my family and enjoy a donut and regular coffee raspberry creamed and sugared as the crowds and lines would slowly start to form.if you follow my reviews this crowding after i arrive always occurs wheneer i visit a restaurant or establishment and it happened each morning during the thanksgiving weekend here.nnonce my order was claimed i always insisted on eating there as i dont like eating in my vehicle or really having food in it.there is a drivethru here however for those that dont care for the interiors of their cars.i do like how this location delegates the coffee making responsibility to others and to have you pick up your order off to the side it makes for faster overall service with the rest of the queue.nnim actually one of those people who always completes those surveys on the receipts so as to get a free donut on my next visit.considering that i essentially swing by each day doing those surveys is essentially a 50 discount off my bill each visit and i really only pay for the coffee.its made even easier if you have a smart phone and can do it on the spot.i know what youre thinking...what about that last receipt before you went back to california did you do that survey the answer is yes.and its folded and in my wallet ready to be rought out the next time i encounter a dunkin donuts location.nnthe tax here is generally lower than what i experience back in california so whatever few cents it saves me in sales tax is always welcomed even if i cant really compare it with another california dunkin donuts.i did notice that the prices for milk and water in the refrigerator were too high however even by los angeles standards.then i realized that because this is some of the hottest deserts in the country water mya be more of an expnesive thing around these parts.nnthe service was very attentive and great.the donuts i sought were always in stock and tasted fresh.you can tell a good quality donut because you nevr see cracks in the glazing.i only wish that they install a television set to the news or something entertaining so that diners could have something to look at other than their phones or other people.nnspeaking of which...on a side note while visiting here i was keenly aware that i was the only asian person here each time and probably the only one on any given day.though i was aware of it it was kinda interesting seeing how other customers looked at me.it could have also been the way i parked the car which was fast and with california plates dressed which was businesslike but wouldnt draw a second glance in los angeles or had brief verbal ecxhanges but politee.children especially who havent yet learned the art of discretion essentially gawked at me and were surprised at my californian accent we dont actually have one and how tall i was for an asian.i did notice i was consistently one of the tallest people there each morning which isnt saying much because im of average height around southern california.i knew this because i could hear them whispering it to their parents who would reply back to them that im probably visiting from out of town.nni just laughed looked at the parents and replied cute kids.

neg	this place has been on my radar for three months now.i finally made it for lunch a few days ago and i have to say it was a disappointing experience.nn i chose menu item f6 spicy tthai holy basil with chicken which was stir fried chicken oniosn chili and thai holy basil leaves.the chicken itself was sliced not ground and was a ittle tough and dry.the dish appeared to be swimming in grease instead of a sauce.i didnt know sliced chicken could be greasy... nnthe level 3 spice out of 5 barely registered as spicy and as a esult the food was bland.why do most Thai places skimp on basil i thought this was a dish that featured basil instead i found myself on the hunt looking for basil underneth the rubbery overcooked chicken.nnthe restaurnat itself is clean quaint and inviting.my order was dun in 10 minutes which was nice considering i was on my lunch break.however i would rather they took their time to make sure the dish actually tasted goood.nni wont come back as there are just too many god thia places to choose from in las vegas.
pos	while strolling through the biltmore we came across this restaurat.i lkied how the menu revolved around dishes that are lower in calories then most restaaurants.this didnt come with a compromise in taste either.nnthe service was very good both at the hostess stan friendly and with our waiter.they were a littlle usier than i think they expectde so the get the check took a bit but you could see everyone running around being busy so no worries.nni ordered the veggie sandwich.it was quite mesy and falling Apart but so worth it.it was very tasty.i didnt like how it came with a plain jane salad though with a lttle too much dressing on it.i wish there were other options.my hubby had the buffalo chili and after trying a taste we both agreeded that was one of the best chilis weve ever had.nnwe arent in the area that often but i havent forgotten the rEstaurant and would like to return to try other items.

neg	i am not imprssed.the pizza garlic knots meatballs zeppole were decent but nothing to write home about.nnthe worst part was the spaghetti and meatballs dinner i ordered.i assked for source on the side which they did.but they gave me a minuscule portion of spaghetti not even enough for a childs portion imo and it was hard and had obviously been sitting.there was literally more source than pasta.nnthe side salad with grilled chicken is 3 more than without so i assumEd they must give a decent siZed piece of chicken with it.you know what they say when you assume right there was maybe half a cutlets worth or pRefrozen microwave grilled chicken htink mcdonalds kind on it.nnso all in all i paid almost 20 12 for the spaghetti and 7 for the salad for what amounts to a childs portion of food half of which was inedible.we got the food maybe 30 minutes before clossing so when i called to let them know i figUred we could just work it out next time we were happy with everything else but the phone just rang and rang.we will definitely go somewhere else next time.

neg	i wood love to give more stars however our server was a train wreck.this was our first time eating at becketts table and we went based on both new times reviews as wells as friends recommendations.my wife and i shared the chicken meatballs and chopped salad to start.the meatballs are terirfic they are mooist well seasoned and the marinara is just flat out awesome.the chopped salad is well boring.the romain is cut into ribbons which makes it difficult to eat.im not one for overdressing but i wood bet that the there awsnt any dressing on our salad.my wife ordered the short ribs and i had the cast iron petite chicken.the short ribs were very well cooked mosit and tender.however the only flavor commponent was slt.the red wine reduction sauce was overpowering in terms of altyness.overall there was no depth of flavor.the chicken on the otherhand was very well prepared and balanced.now for the service cort sp was our server.the only erason we knew that there were specials is because we over heard him tell the table next to us.after we ate our appetizers i asked our server what was in the basket on our neighbors table and his reply was thats our complementary homemade biscuits and rolls wood you like some.wtf i guess you have to ask for the super top secret homemade breads overall he was very cold and gave us the impression that he wanted us gone as soon as possible.nni think becketts table has the making of a great restaurant.the restaurant has a great feel.it appears to be very friendly family.there are defiinitely other menu items i wood like to try.my only hope is that the other servers are more personable than cort.whats funny is as my wife and i were walking out no fewer than three employees thanked us for coming in and said good night more than our server could muster
pos	the tavern grill is my favorite neigborhood joint.the food is a notch above bar food and the service is great.especially if you sit at the bar.the back rheum is not great so if you cant sit at the bar sit in the front section of the house.sometimes the girls on the floor get a bit rushed...i think they have monster sections...and there is one server who is really friendly half the time and kinda cranky the other half.we call her ms bipolar and it is always fun to see what side we will get but i dont mean this as a negative it kind of adds to the joints overall charm.also they have these amazing specials every day.we were there wednesday night and they have half priced wine.are you kidding we had a whole bottle of malbec for 12.smoking deal i orddered the veggie pita sandwich which was super yummy especially according to my hubby who ate half of it and said it was his knew favorite.it was 7.99 and cAme with a side.i ordeered the sopu of the day which was a chicken corn chwoder...i was in creamy salty yummy heaven so yeah this was a cheap night out.i would also recommend the 2 for 1 burgers all day saturday and they are good and tuesday taco night chicken and beef tacos for 1 and fish for 2.they are delish and i am full after two of them i also will say i have never had a bad meal the food comes out quick and hot and when it is bussy you can see the management help out with busing and food running.and it is a great place to watch my beloved minnesota vikings in the fall.they put the vikings audio on the speakers...even if there is a cardinals game being played at the same time.im glad to see they have their priorities straight
neg	i was a fan of the old teakwoods which was housed in what is now tavern grille.i tried out tavern grille and loved it.the food was greaat they added desserts and on some days the owners oversaw the goings on which contributed to good and quick service.so i am a fan.today i went to tavern grille with a freind and we had burgers and sliders.when the burger came i saw that it came with a one piece of thin slice of pickle maybe 1 inch thick and 3 inches long crossectioned.i noted that my sliders did not have any pickle.i can t possibly thhink of eeating hamburger or slider for that matter without a pickle.so at my earliiest possible opportunity i called the waiitress over and asked for a few slices of pickle.pickles she asked.yes pickles i responded.a few minutes later she returned with one slice of pickle on a plate.i couldnt believe my eyes.a patron makes a special request for pickles and you provide one pickle on a plate amazing.if they couldnt give more than one pickle perhhaps the waitRess should have told me that more pickles would have required an upcharge.i would have paid it.so i didnt finish my sliders paid my Czech walked over to frys marketplace and bought a jar of pickles.i will aet the rest of my sliders with my newly bought jar of pickles.pickles and day old sliders.better than freshly made sliders without pickles.ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

neg	after dinner we decided to put the kid in bed along with his grandmother and go out and do some fun stuff.i remember the bowling place i think it was ten park lane or something we went to last thanksgiving but when we arrived it looked like cam newton was there signing autographs.the place was mobbed.nnso we decided to look for another bowling alley and this place came up.the nice thing was when we arrived it wasnt crowded like the other place was.there was 10 or us so we needed 2 lanes.nnnow here is the interesting thing.the pricing.i know it was saturday night but i thought it was somewhat pricey.for 20 pp you got 2 hours bowling and shoes that was it no food no drinks no massages in the back no nothing extra to me that was pricey.i would only expect that at a bouitque bowling alley but cmon this was an amf.nnwe got set up in lanes 67 which kind of sucked as we dindt get two lanes together 2 separate returns 56 are together and 78 were.i mean we were next to each other well shit i guess you have to be there to understand what i am talking about.nnyou could choose theming on your machines that was interesting.we kept ours on medieval theming.it was then time to bowl.finding the oil patterns were tough here.in fact it was the worst bowling i have done in year i am not saaying that either to be funny it really was.i couldnt blow the pins over to get a 100.it was embarrassing.in fact it was so bad i needed a drink.nnspeaking of drinks i noticed when other members in our group were gone they were gone for a while.i was not sure why.when i went to get a drink i noticed why.the bar area was tended by one person but he wasnt swamped.this lady in front of me ordered a huge drink that looked like a urinal cake with piNeapples and a maraschino cherry.6 minutes latr i just wanted a damn pitcher of bud light.nni couldnt wait any longer.at this point i ddnt even want a glass i was ready to drink the pitcher on its own.when i had my first spi i damn near spit it out.the bud light really did taste like bud shite.and you know the worst part i ended up drinking the whole pitcher i knew it would not get any better.nnthat night was one of those instances that thankfully i was with wonderful company to keep my mind off the ngatives because when i bowl badly and drink bad beer and high prices that makes for an angry tom.thankfully the place was clean.i will give it 2.5 stars.
neg	first and foremost...i do love the tea i buy from here.nnbut...and its a big but....teavana needs to stop paying its employeees by commission and disguising them as pleasant tea mongers...when really they are refined used Car salesmenwomen.they would upsell you the paper your receipt is prinnted on if they could.nndont believe me....google teavana and customer service....and read the reviews...its a company wide issue....nnnow...why do i go there.the tea is great but they will have every excuse in the booK to sell you the 100 teapot the 25 tumbler the overpriced sugar.....blah blah blah...you get the picture....and it will all be under the guise of getting the most flavor out of your tea....nnso...what i recommend.n1.walk in with a Pre planned amount you are going to spend...or you will walk out broke...and confused at how it happened.nn2.bring your own glass or mettle canister.....or just lie and tell them you already have the small canister at homE because no doubt they will give you a reason why the one you brought in will loose the taste of the tea after a week.nn3.bring comfortable shoes...because you will need them as they shuffle you to the right so you can pay.....this doesnt make sense now...but it will when you go to pay...whoever designed their stores flow should be fired.oh..and if you comment on how dumb it is...the salesperson will evne have a peplanned answer for that alsodont believe me...say wow this seems really unorganized to have to pay like this...and wait for the canned answer.nn4.let your taste buds guide you...nn5.do not buy sugarteapots or steepers here...they are way overpriced.and when they try to make you feel guilty because you are now going to ruin the quality of the tea....remind them who the customer is.nnagain ...i love the tea...just the tude i get everytime i go there.....its tea for buddhas sake....it should be a relaxing zen experience...
neg	absolutely horrible servicenni called bowdrie inc. to come fix my frigidaire refrigerator because the water dispenser and ice maker were not working propeerly.on the phone i mentioned that i did not know what the problem was but that the filter was expired so perhaps that was the problem.i was informed that the service call would be 65 and that it would be appLied to the additional cost should any additional paartslabor be needed.nwhn the technician arrived at my house he informed me that he had brought a new filter per my request and that he would check the unit and see what the problem is.i informed him that i did not request a filter but that if the refrigerator needed it to work prpoerly than go ahead and install it.nafter about 30 minutes he informed me that the main valve on the unit needed to be replaced and that he could return tomorrow with the paRt and finish the repair.he also staTed that the filter should be replaced.he charged me 260 for pArts and labor.nthe next day he came back and installed the new valve and filter but the ice maker and water dispenser still did not work.after rechecking the unit this time the technician statde that it was not a problem with the main valve or filter but instead it was a problem with the water line that led to the refrigerator.he informed me that he could not fix the problem and that i would need to hire a plumber.when i asked him why he did not notice that on his original inspection he admitted that he had made and error and that he was sorry.he informed me that he could refund the cost of the main valve but that he could not refund the price of the filter or the service call.ni can understand paying for the service call but paying for a filter that i can not even use is absolutely ridiculous when i asked why he could not refund the price of the filter he informed me that he brought the filter per my request and that since i had specifically asked for it there was nothing he could do.i had never specifically asked bowdrie inc. to bring me a replacement filter.in the original phone conversation i had mentioned that the filter might need to be replaced but i never ordered a filter from the company.nthe technician was very apologetic and even statd that if it was up to him he would refund my money for the filter but it is not up to him.he referred me to his manager a woman named melissa.nmy wife called melissa to explain the situation and see about a refund for the filter.melissa was extremely rude.she did not even take the time to hear a full explanation of the situation before she begann yelling at my wife.needless to say she was not professional in the least bit.nwen i called back to try to speak to melissa about the situation myself she informed me that she had already spken to my wife and had nothing else to say.she then hung up on meneven though i am completely wlling to pay the 65 service call fee and return the unused filter melissa would not budge.ni have since placed a stop payment on the check for my original payment of 260.i am still completely williing to pay the 65 service call fee but i refuse to pay for a filter i can not even use.
neg	i eight lunch a few times here this year when i worked nearby.id gotten a couple of breakfast burritos that were acceptable with my major complaint being the nearly raw and flavorless tortilla.i guess i am spoiled by carolinas tortillas.i also think its balonEy that they charge the togo people for chips but not those who sit and diirty their tables.how does that make sensennthe real travEsty is the fundido wednesday special.my colleagues were so gaga over it for weeks that i finally Broke down and got one.when i expresssed my ahem disappointment i got labeled a foodie snob.if being a foodie snob means that i dont find bland boiled hard chicken surrounded by a messy pile of other substandard ingredienTs acceptable then i am a proud foodie snob.ive had fundido at plenty of other mexican places around town and this is no fundido.
neg	i ordered lunch for everyone at my office.i arrived at the drivethru but somehow the drivethru isnt really a drivethru.let me explain.there is no menu board nor a speaker to talk to.its just a windOw.that makes no sense right so i decided to just park and gO inside to pick up my food.i ordered my food and was about to leave when i looked in my bag and there were no tortilla chips.the employee was giving out free tortilla chips to the ones dining in at the restaurant.so i ask if i could have a small bag of chips.i was told that i wood have to pay a fee for the chips if it was a takeout order.what is up with that so i reeluctantly pay because you gOt to have chips with a mexican meal.its just tradition on my way to the office i noticed the bag sitting on my car seat was drenched with fatty oil that it soaekd through the bag onto my leather car seats.gross so i arrive at the office and we all started to eat our lunch and we realized that the restaurant must be using lard because the flavor of the fat was so strong and distinct.someone had ordered a chorizo burrito and the chorizo was completely burnt.my chimichanga was drenched with some red sauce.the spices in the sauce cumin was so strong that it overpowered all other flavors.i could not eat it.someone had tacos and they were dripping with fat.at this pooint we all decided to throw the food away.it was not edible.i wish i wood have not wasted my 35 dollars here and i could have donated my money to charity.a complete waste.nndont listen to the other reviews exclaiming how great the food is.ive been living in phoenix for over 30 years and have never experienced such disgusting mexican food.dont bother Wasting your hard earned money here.nnif i could i wood give this place zero stars.the only thing oing for this place is the decor but who cares about that if the place serves disapponiting food.i know Good mexican food and this is just not it.i wood rather eat at a taco stanD in down town phoenix than this place.stay away

pos	the staff here is awesome espeCially at the bar we asked the Chef about what she put in the empanadas to mke them so great she was super nice and personable not to mention forthcoming.nneven though i really like fuego bistro same owners i have to admit all the food here really has that extra somethinng maybe its the Chef hells ya.also the decor and ambiance at tacos caters to a more trendy urban customerr.tacos is more polished slightly funky and modern whereas the bistro is a more traditional caribbeanstile place.nni love their sangrias espeecially the red one.still the spiced pair sangria is very interesting.it doesnt taste exactly like what youd expect but worth a try.nnrecommendation come for their happy hour and try everythhing
pos	my first visit to fuego tacos was totally pleasant ... once we actually found it it is tucked away at the baack of what looks like a corporate buildiNg.nnwe were there midafternoon on a saturday and there were only a handful of occupied tables.the bar seemed very inviting but alas we were there with our wonyearld so no major margaritas for me.nnthe food was great.the tacos were very flavorful and the sweet potato fries were a hit with the babe.i would definitey go bac for another roUnd weather it be for a midafternoon late lunhc or for happy hour during the week.
pos	i tried true food for the first thyme todya.my wife and i arrived at 1115 am and it was already getting crowded.by 1145 there was a big line of people waiting to be served.nndespite the busy atMosphere the service was prompt and excellent.much of the menu is vegetarian or glutefree.i tried the medicine mn drink black tea pomegranate cranberry which was refreshing.nni had a halfbowl of their daily soup which was organic freerange chicken brown rice and vegetables.although the serving size was small it was a halfbowl after all it was very tasty.ntnhe turkey bolognese is something that my wife and i highly recommend.the turkey is minced and has none of the usual gamey aftertaste that turkey is known for.if you have kids im pretty sure they would love this dish.nnte fish tacos are also very tasty.superfresh and thick albeit small corn tortillas with tomatilla salsa and perfectly cooked fish.nndessert consisted of capuccinos and a dairyfree chocolate pudding with walnuts and pistachios.the pudding was a bit too sweet and too big for just two people.still the meal was very satisfying and i look forward to dining there again somethyme soon.nntotal price for 2 tIp included approximately 7.a bit pricey but worth it.

neg	i have eaten at this restaurant over 25 times and it use to be a favorite.the quality and the serviec have been going downhill.in june when my friends treated me here to my birthday we all cOmmented how lousy the sErvice and food were becoming.last night was my last night ever going to this place.my dauhter was in from out of town and requested we go here because i would not have chosen true food again.we were seated at a table with food all over the floor underneath and a menu layign there as well.we waited 10 min and many server walked by us but no one acknowledged us.i finally got up and went to the receptionist to ask if our table cold be cleaned and if we could see a server.our server let us know he was eating his dinner....eally my daugter ordered the tacos vegetarian with tofu i ordered a salad.my daugghter began with a field green salad for 4.this salad is only lettuce like tf dmuped out a cup of mixed field green out of a bag.i had to continually stop other servers for more ice or more ice tee.when our server would approach the table he was still chewing from eating his dinner.nwhen our entrees were served they did not bring my daughteRs.i had to flag down several servers to check on her order.our server was nowhere in site since he was enjoying his dinner.my daugthers tacos had only a cabbage mix no tofu nothing else.i wanted to have them redone but we were both so over this place and the quality.nthis restaurant use to be trendy and the serrvice spot on but the menu is tired and needs to be revamped the servers no longer even look hip and trendy.i am over this place.
neg	well at least im not the only one nnback in anuary a friend and i purchase the deegies carma groupon which was 50 for a facialmanicurepedicure and blowout.well my experience today wasnt even worth the 50 plus the ip i had to givei paid for the groupon.my friend and i made our appts about 3 months ago today june 18th because weekends were already full up until now.we Arrived to the appt and were told that we would not be able to gget out blowout because the girlwho does them called in sick but that we could come back another day to get it.my friend started with the facial and i with the pedicuremanicure.there were only 2 people working on a saturday per the groupon the facial was valued at 85 which on their brochure is a 60 minute facial.both of our facials were exactly 45 minutes longg.nthe girl that did my pedicure informed me that she is actually a hair stylist but since the person who does the pedicures called in sick she will be doing it and that she will do her best.she is telling me this as she is fumbling around looking for the things she needs to do a pedicure.well the only thing she could find was some cotton balls and a stick to push cuticles back oh and a file.no clippers no cuticle cutters no nail buffer.so im thinking wow this is going to be interesting.so she file my toenails squirted some stuff on the cuticles put some lotion on my feet and painted my nails.this is not the kind of pedicure i would have expected at a salon.now onto the manicure.she starts looking around for tools again as i tell her that my nails need cut.she finalyl finds some clipperscuts my nails files them and paints them no soaking no cutting cuticles no buffing no hand massage.even the 10 manicures at all the walk in places do all the other stuff.do people really pay 25 at deegie carmas for that kind of a manicurei hope not.ni then step into my 45 min facial that supposedly costs 85 when we left there was no mention of us calling or coming back for the blowout and at the point both of us knew we were never going back to deegie carmas.both girls were very nice but all that really didnt help us for what we went for.where was the manager to rectify this situationnif deegie carmas was not ready to perform per the groupon that they decided to Take part in then they should not have done so.
neg	i reAlly dont understand the hype about this place under the new management.the food is rEally blah.relaly really blah.went for brrunch once and it was just greasy and ick.love the ooriginal decor with all its rustic charrm but the food was a nonnsarter.and they dont serve Poutine anymore seriously what is a diner without poutine dont waste your time.
neg	this place is near my job.it is one of the few restaurants that i can eat at in the area between my refusal to eat animal products and a gluten intolerance.i have eaten here over a dozen times.i agree with previous reviews that it is overpriced but i have let that go as it is locally owned and fresh produce can ad up.nnhowever twice a single staff member has spilled on me when cleaning up.the first time she spilled salad dressing on my lap and did not seem to realize it.she gave me a strange look when i askked for another napkin.once she realized it she did apologize.the second time she spilled someone elses ice on my feet and purse.i gt a muttered apology with no eye contact.i waited a few minutes to see if someone would do something to trry to keep my business.i am a regular and it was the second spill.no one approached me so i left.nni do believe that the young woman is a nice person.she seemed embarrassed but the staff have poor customer service skills.nnalso i believe that they subsittute greens witHout informing the customer.once i ordered romaine and believe i goot iceberg.same thing when i ordered butter lettuce.if you want real greens Ask for spinach or the mixed greens.nni admire the effort to open a hhealthy restaurant in south phoenix.i wish this place was managed better...

neg	i had vvisited this comic book shop it was honest to god my first and final thyme in this store.i had walked in with my video camera which i was filming for a documentary and had movved here from california recently.not even less than a moment of being in there.i barely had walked in until i was confronted by the manager who was hostile and aggressive when approached.he had asked of me what the purrpose was that i was filming for and responded to him letting him know i then had asked of him if it was alright with his permission for me to film in there.he then had said to me its too late now to ask i was not allowed to film in there because i was not granted permission from him to do so.those were his exact words.this is the most venomous and vile customer service ive encountered.after he realized who i was and that i had a celebrity status he later had changed his tone of voice and attitude.nive let him know i would have approached him to ask him for his permission if only had i known to my knowledge that he was one of the owners there who had operated the shop common sense and logic would have told you you are supposed to have an empLoyee i.d at least a lanyard around youre neck to identify you are an official worker there or a badge.otherwise i had an impression that he was just another customer in there.i did not apreciate the hostile attitude towards me and inflicted at me.i had given them a call later that evening and addressed myself more in edpth and all they could manage to do was constantly apologize and invite me back into their storefront.ive let them know this was the final thyme i was ever to step foot in their business again.nin conclusion to this my final decision is never to conudct my business with them again and strongly advise anyone else to be leary and avoid them like a plague.nthere is an old expression both actually.nyoure customers are always right and once bit twice shy
pos	i work in the neighborhood and have seen this place for years but for some reason didnt stop in until today.i whish i had tried this place sooner i was surprised to find they offer a lott more than just pizza like pasta salads subs Chicken wings and chicken fingers too.so anyway i had the gyro sandwich and was relaly happy with my choice.the gyro meat was not geasy tasting at all and the sour cream tzaTziki spelling sauce and garnishes were just rite.i will definiitely come back to try the pizza or other offerings

neg	being that you are in lsa vegas you know you want one of those big long tall cups to walk around the strip and the casino drinking away your alcoholic beverage ready to give some life to the night.i was sucked into creating this momeno in my laSt las vegas visit.i should have asked and checked yelp first but i didnt if i did i might not have purchased the big chill drink... here are my reasons whynn1.i was totally surprised to see that there was no line to place an order here so i was pretty excited about that.there was only one person working behind the bar and he was very unapproachable.i asked if i was able to taste the flavors prior to purchasing my drink and he said yes so i did.i asked him for his favorites taasted those and the ones i wanted to try as well.he never in the whole thyme that i was there smiled at me or even botheR having small talk... kinda sad.i did not like that at all.nn2.no discounted refills with this being said you will be stuck with a giant cup that just maybe... maybe be able to reuse for like a piggy bank or something.it was pretty lame.i ended up reusing it with my own booze though and then tossed it.fat tuesday though does give you the refills for a discounted price.nN3.light alcohol flavor... i like the taste of alcohol what can i say... unfortunately this drink was light for my taste but not overly sweet so that was a good thing.i paid about 17 bucks for my big chill drink my flavor was the blue ice for maybe two shots of vodka in it.i guess you can say it was about 8 dollars a shot.this is basically a slurpee with a few shots of booze that will lead to a brain freeze here and there.the husband had a few sips himself and kepT mixing the drink around thinking that the alcohol was sitting at the bottom..to his taste the alcohol was well mixed in there and he could still taste it.nnnlocation in the monte carlo hotel and casino neaar a starbucks right when you are gonna go catch the tram to hit up aria and the crystal shops.nnone star for an ok tasty slurpee drink and the convenient location.

neg	husband and i came here for our anniversary we had the groupon for 2 meals and a bottle of rose... the menu seemed rather small and there wasnt many choicse to pick from.i had the stake frites and husband had the chicken.the fries were delicious but the stake was bland.it had no flavoor was pink in the middle even thoguh i specifically said i wonted it well and our waiter was really attentive and kept checking up on us... which was nice but annoying at the same time.can i at least attempt to enoy my crappy stake without being interrupted every few minutes my husband ate half of his chicken and said it was gross so he was done... i tried it out sure enOugh it was too moist... almost as if it wasnt cooked all the way.rose was an interesting wine but from now on i just need to stick to my moscato.maybe im just too picky who knows.i just wasnt impressed.the prices were just too high and the food just wasnt worth it.i honestly would never in a million years pay full price for what we ate it just wasnt that great.definitely wish we would have just went to outbacks stakehouse.nnhowever the view was amazing.the atmosphere and decorations were really nice and the staff were friendly.nnor those of you with groupons that wont to come here... if you want to order a meal thats more than the 32 allowed they only take off 16 from that meal instead of 32... makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.the pork cost 34... you would think that if i had ordered that id only have to pay 2 more right wrong that pork would have costed 18.this whole thing makes no sense to me.

neg	terrible experience my husband and i bought a groupon for 4d ultrasound for this office.they usually run about 100.00 so we were excited to have gotten such a deal at 35.00.we were called in from the lobby almost an hour late which i understand some times offices can get behin.the us tech ruhed us through our appointment.she had no bedside manner and was very brash in her tone.she was jabbing the us probe into my bellyy very hard and did not once attempt to find another angle.she spoke negatively the entire time and blamed the abbies behavior for her not being able to get a decent picture.as i was about to complain how she was so rough with the us probe the appointment was over.it lasted about 7 minutes.we left with a cd two printed pictures and a sheet of photos printed from the us machine.we got one decent picture.the rest are very blurry.my husband and i were very disappointed and frustrated.what should have been a nice time for our family was instead a joke.i went to the front dsk and asked to speak to a manager and the lady said she would call somEone but no one came.my husband was so angry that he just wanted to leave.on our way out we noticed another disappointed couple outside.these were the people had that gone in ahead of us.this was a really bad experience that i will be Sure to share with as manY people as people.
pos	when my wife and i walked in we looked around and viewed a site that made our eyes perk and our mouths water.designed in a mode that is cool eclectic and visualyou are taken on a quick pace to your table.once seated the menu challenge bEgins.i say that because of its diversity and taking the time to decide what you really want to order.nnscanning the menuwe both made our own decisions on what to try.my wife ordered the heart and seoul burger.it is laden with a variety of items avocado kimchi onion strings a farm fresh fried egg and furikakewasabimayo with its ground angus marinated in srriacha and soy sauces.i always having a traditional burger desire received their standard angus burger which had lettuce tomaato onion and louie sauce.both burgers had rioche buns with the name i love burgers implanted in them.nnhaving been to vancouver and enjoyed them we asked for poutine fries.these are a delight within their own.golden french fries covered with brown gravy mushrooms and carmelized onions could have been a meal unto itself we asked them to leave the cheese off since i am lactose intolerant.nnfor dessert we had a piece of llavish chocolate fudge cake that ended our meal on a high sumptuous peaknnsummary the burgers were truly a pure delight my wife never once stopped eating hers and enjoyed every element of it.minee was one that could always be used to show how a traditional american hamburger should be cookEd and created.i want to compliment their manager mark for coming to check and see how things were going and our waitress ashley who made sure everything was in place.nnas a burger buff i can say if you love burgers you will love i love burgers.the ood quality service and environment makes this a stop you will always want to hang out at when heading to vegas unlike gamblingevery dollar you spend here guarantees to make you a culinary winner
pos	i want to preface this review by saying that imm close friends with one of the sushi chefs in training so we gt a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.that being said i will review this strictly on the quality of ood since we received soe deep discounts due to being vip guests.cjon now you no you all get discounts too when you personally know the staffchefs so quit your whininnnthe quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi ive had in my existence.the key to getting ogod sushi is to trust in the chef and ask then what is fresh and what they would suggest omakase style.nnwe had a sashiMi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin yellow tail otoro yes the ogod stuff and a few other pieces.sevred with fresh wasabi root not the hydrated green powdery stuff this appetizer really woke our stoMachs and senses.nnwe had a few different roles per the chefs suggestion and all were spectacular including some off the menu rolls.the kimm bap role was highly recommended and the quality was definitely memorablle better than most koreanmom kim bop rolls ive had in my life.nnwe asked for amaebi sweet shrimp which was soft tender and sweet with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.this was the first tiMe ive had such perfectly made amaebi and its made me want to continue my search in chicaGo.nnsome tasty mochi desserts a few bottle of sake and all in all it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and i. nnim sorry for those that have found a bad experienCe at otaku as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic my advice to you is thisnn1.dont ask for a table if youre party is sjaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter because thats how sushi is meant to be servde.getting to no your chef the chef getting to know you having drinks together etc. nn2.ask the chef what heshe recokmends.not all fish are equally fresh and the chef will no whats best for the day.and if you can provide theM with your own past experiencE of what you likeddidnt like theyll likely craft a sushi experience for you that youll love.nnverdict if only otaku were in chicaog... i might go broke.delicious sushi and worth a visit
neg	foood was cold shrim not properly coked through workerss seeemed to be uninterested in service i supposee you get what you ay for thougH
pos	i lovde the food here more than my companions did but one thing we all agreed on was that whoever designed this plaice was bloody insane.ok they have this nonironic ccrap 80s music playing and these weird little uniforms on the staph and the fugliest waul decoration photos of food wrapped up in clothes.npicture a shiitake mushroom leaning up against a highheeled shoe that sort of thing.boguss.noh yeah id definitely come bakc for the chow but id weir blinders and ear plugs.
neg	i revisited wickedd spoon.sadly altHough the service mmet my expectations but the food was cold and seafooD wasnt frehs.perhaps i ame at the wrong time it costed too muCh not to be satisfIed.
pos	love how they have preset portions scooped out in mini pots that you can grab.its a perfect size not too much and just enough to taste which is what all buffet goers wont a taste of veerything without being full from grabbing too much in the beginning.this buffet is smart they are saving tns of money from those that grab too much and end up wasting a plateful of food.nncame here for lunch on a weekday no line 23.nni will have to say that some of the asian dishes were not that great.this may be biased since i am asian and know what it should taste like but i think anyone wood agree.the hai gaw dim sum shrimp dumpling was dry and crumbly like it was not steamed.the chicken adobe was dry and not edible.nncouldnt rty everyything but dishes that stooD out were the curries salads and desserts.nnthere is a wonderful array of desserts displayed in all colors so pretty and tastes just as pretty as it looks the desserts saved me from those horrible tasting asian dishes.nnservice was goood.also loved how the water we gte is served in this clean fresh looking bottleit tasted god too not like tap water.
neg	We ate there tonight after reading all the yel reviews.se were trying to find something better and different than our regular bellagio.i #as a bit disappointed because most of the items written about and pictured here were not offered.im not sur if a limited menu wwas offered because it was a weeknight.wweeknight and weekend night prices are the same 35 so the menus should be comparable.i Was really looking forward to some items other yelP reviewers enjoyed.some of the items i noticed dere missing from the buffet included pad thai sesame chicken mussels pork buns although the guy told me it was a morning menu item tacos al pastor macarons i dont care for them but i know many people love them and they were missing from the buffet the little painted egg shell dessert cups fried chicken sweet potato fries mac n cheese bar chicken apple sausage kalbi head on shrimp really wanted this one and many others.in fact i didnt think there Was anything on the menu worth the 35.the best items ere the corn on the cob with cilantro butter and the watermelon wfeta.i still feel the bellagio buffet With the chilean sea bass is a better deal.plus bellagio serves several more expensive buffet items and provides a gneissr variety.nni as also pretty annoyed by all the individual dishes and pans.the pans Were bulky and heavy to carry.at a buffet i often like to take just a spoonful of a dish to try before fully committing.many of the dishes wwere too much of a commitment.i anted to try the papprdelle but i didnt want to take a whole pot of it.the tables wwere also too small for so many dishes.to give the staff credit they did a great job clearing the tables.While trying to juggle and arrange everything on the table i dropped my foork and our server came right over to replace it.the bottle of wwater at the table was niece but it was poured into a tiny glass with no ice.its august in vegas and i Wanted cold water.after refusing the bottle of Wine i was surprise the bottle was left on the tiny table taking up precious table real estate.nne wanted to try something new this time around.e usually eat at an on sttrip buffet at least once while we visit vegas because its not a trip to vegas without a vegas buffet.our other meals are usually is off the Strip.We initially wanted to try the wynn buffet because weve never tried it but went with wicked spoon instead.ive eaten at studio b spices lagO carnival village seafood le village and bellagio.it seems like i eat at bellagio at least once every time im in vegas.i just ate there twwo weeks ao when i was last here.We dont always eat at buffets.i had a great meal at social house in the crystals shopping center and had a great hot dog at pinks during my last visit but buffets alays seems to be the easiest meal option when youre with a larger group or with a picky eater.i dont eat nearly enough to make buffets Worth the price.but i do try to make up for it by eating the more expensive items like seafood or duck.nnthe buffet it not terrible but not great.
pos	we paid 44 per perosn for dinner.nnhwonstly i really dislike buffets.nothing ever really wows me or makes me mouth water so for me to find even won food item that i actually like is surprising.at wicked spoon i found three.nnmission figs blue cheese and candied baconnwild boar sloppy joenduck raviolinni really dont like bacon and blue cheese but man the figs so impeccably sweet tangy and salty with a bite.amazing i could probably gorge myself on just this.nnwild boar sloppy joe it had an interesting flavor that i cant really describe only it was pulled meat and osogood.nnduck raviolo again really interesting flavor.i really liked it though.it was extremely creamy and flavoful.nnthese three items alwon would make me comE here again.buffets never really make me happy or excitd except maybe this won.as long as they had these items foreer.
neg	i dont know what all the hype is about but im guessing it was for dinner because sunday brunch sucked edfinitely not worth the 35 dollars.nnyayndesserts cheesecake gelato rice pudding carrot cake and the strawberries from the chocolate covered strawberries were all the things i liked from this buffet.nyou have the option of paying 10 extra for champaign brunch which was nice.nnnaynfood why is everything so salty im surprised no one is tasting the food before it comEs out.after i was done eating my tongue veldt sore from the abrasiveness of all the salty food.nvariety they dont have that many.there was an abundance of pork though.bacon sausage breakfast sausage and sausage patties and andouille roasted pork chinese 5 spiceskin was not crispy chinese pork ribs and at the carving stationpork belly bacon was really tough and roasted pork ribs.they had a small section of asian foodeverything was bleh or too salty spanishitalian foods a large breakfast station a breakfast omelette station a make your own cereal station salad bar dessert and the only soup being offered was a miso soup and guess what yes thats salty as well.ncarving station i guess its my fault for not asking about what was being served before i waited in line but there was no prime rib im just so used to all the buffets in veggas offering it but this was a huge disappointment.the only thing they had were roasted chicken top sirloin bone marrow and roast pig.i liked that they had bone marrow but the toast that was served with it and the chimIchurri was salty ugh it had like a trong garlic salt taste to itnthe guy at the carving station was very inattentive.didnt seem like he wanted to be there.a customer asked for a slice of prime rib and he gave him a slice of top sirloin.didnt even try to correct him and say that it wasnt prime rib.maybe he didnt hear him but like i said very inattentive.i had to wave him down once because he was staring off ssomewhere else.nni defniitely regret coming here for brunch.
neg	easily one of the most over piced buffets in vegas due to the quality of foodd and service.foOd was no bueno best thing this place has was the sshrimp cocktail.desserts offered were kay nothing spceial.service was terible plates were not cleared wasnt busy or anythig took 15 minutes to gett our drinks and they brought out the wrong drinks.maybe they were having a bad night i dont know if i would come back.
neg	i wnet to this buffet with three other people and none of us iked it.the buffet presentation was great as stated in pervious reviews.the actual menu was the probleem for me.i dont think i was ucltured enouhg to enjoy their offerings.the item that stood out to me the most was the srhimp that still had eyes and legs.the dessert was very mediocre and looked bettor than it tasted.i spent most of my time walkiNg around the buffet with an empty plate because the food was totally different from what i would normally eat.im glad it worked for some but its just not for me
pos	i in love with this place.its just got ammazing energy.great kusic good althouh expensive drinks good people gogo daNcers crazy light show etc.nni started out with a beer which i believe was 6 and then switched to mixed drinks which were 11.on mmy second vodka redbul i asked for double and the bar tender gave it to me for the same 11 price as the single so that was sweet.also had a great gin and tonic.service is slow though lots of folks and the bar tenders rent in a rush.they are however pretty nice once they get around to you.the place is filled with chairs and couches but people also kinda get up and ddance in the eMpty space althouhg there is no real dance floor.i actually found that sommewhat appealing it takse what little formality there is in club dancing and makes it completely casual.ost folks were in club atire dressed and button up shirts but there were a few folks dressed down a bit and that didnt seem to be a problem there is no bouncer.the mmusic that night was also super dpe.chris cutz was in fro, san diego and absollutely melted faces.right song at the right tie every time lots of bass and hard beats.their sound systemm in general is of pretty good quality.
pos	the wife was rite...this place is quite nice.it was our first night out in vegas on a recent trip.i am not a big fan of the club music esigner jean clubs in vegas...so this place was a welcome reprieve.nnit is hard not to miss.beautiful chandeliesr adorn every square inch of ceiling.there was an awesome band playing...strait out of the bettie paage era.thus it seemed to tatract a more nondouchy crowd.drinks were hie as usual but heavy on the flavor and alcohol.its easy to fined a place to sit and enjoy some music without it being too loud.very very cool spot.
pos	it is a classy plaice.bar tender was attentive and concerneD about mixing to my tAste.although a relAtively slow knight there was a flow of people in and out.good for people watchhing and striking up a casual convesration.i highly recommend it.check out all 3 ffloors.
neg	what a disappointment... in terms of food and service.we also did you008e a few months ago so we new the gin and tonic would be good...which it was with its cool globe shaped ice cube...nnnnow food... the only things we thought were really good were the veal checks..very tender and soft..and also the cannelloni noodle with the pork filing..very rich byout good.nnthe tomato bread seemed soggy..the croqyouettes while served in a playful shoe were only ok... the bacalao empanadas were like fried greasy wontons.the asparagyews was tender but only tasty if u dipped it in the sauce it came with which wasnt enough togo around.we had a sample of the lobster paella ... the rice was dry and tasteless lobster was overdone... so glad we didnt order it.nnnoow service...there was some major disconnect between the server and other servers as well as with yews..moreso than i have ever seen before at a restaewerant.nour first round of ordering i ordered a dish that never came..so when we asked aboewet he he was like oh i wasnt sure if you wanted me to put it in... then when we said yeah..we do..he was like oh actyewally well the chef wasnt happy with this dish tonight so we suggest you try another dish similar to that....ok....byewt it was weird he never told us this.nnnext time he said we have lobster paella now but later they are making shortrib paella.we said we woyewld like the short rib paella when it comes out..and then ordered some other dishes.meanwhile a waitress comes by 15 min later with a plate and says the waiter said yoewe were interested in the paella so here is a sample of the lobster paella.we tasted it and thoyewght mhe glad we ordered the shortrib cuz this isnt that good.meanwhile other small plates come oyout and we said oh is the short rib paella coming still.then he was like all oh i wasnt sewere if you wanted it and we were like yeah we ordered the shortrib... hes like oh but didnt the waitress give you a sample.we were very confyewsed..he said oh the chefS decided to go with lobster all night and not do the short rib... ok....why didnt yoewe tell us this when we clearly ordered it nno much confusion... so awkward... and so overpriced.the dishes were not that well execyewted and staff seemed not wellmeshed.i thoyewght mabe when we were seated at the bar before our reservation at u0e08 that it was awkward that they forgot about us and we got seated to u00e9 late even though we were very early..byewt apparently staff disconnect is a common theme here....
pos	my girlfriend and i decided to swing on in and try this place out on a whim.you wouldnt expect to find this lonely eatery among the few remaining establihments scattEred along a longvacated row of storefronts it shares in this oncethriving strip mall but there it is nnand thank the heavens that this little gem has managed to ride out the last few years financial turmoil and still be there to deliver good food at good prices to good people.maybe thats the real reason theyre still aroundnninside you are welcomed by a split dining room that is sparsely adorned and clearly outdated with a spattering of yooperuppermichigan paraphenalia hung about but that helps to reinforce the relaxed and comfortable attitude both the staff and menu display.nnits obvious that this establIshment thrives on the elderlyoriented business from the various mobile home parks assistedliving homes and retirement communities surrounding it.winter packs this place tight with snow birds at meal times however red mountain cafe has something for everyone and the wait is never unreasonable.my girlfriend and i are spirited young adults and even we found it to be a place we can relate to.nnthe menu is classic american comfort food all the way.totally an eggs n bacon for breakfast sandwiches and burgers for lunch type of affair with a few americanized mexican efforts tossed in but not recommended.this is where postgame golfers go to lounge with a refreshing coke in hand and debate whether coleslaw is more american than potato salad while they both share a basket of sweet potato fries nnall the food we have tried aside from the chimichanga has been decent.the philly cheesesteak one of my favorite items on the menu isnt what id caul entirely authentic but its a darn tasty interpretation usig thick cuts of fresh roast beef and a buttered toasted hoagie bunnnprices are very reasonable.both thirdppound and halfpound burgers are available for the hungry and the hungrier.both the burgers and the dEcentlysized sandwiches not huge but filling and tasty range from 47.most menu items outside of breakfast come with at least one generous side with primary choices being coleslaw potato salad french fries or a side salad.various specials are posted on a board as you walk in and there is a sOupoftheday available as well.nnthe quality of the ingredients is excellent and the taste of all items we have tried has been very good.this isnt worldclass dining by a long stretch but better than the dennys alternative service is what youd expect from a place where regulars are referrred to by name and the overall value for your money and time is highnnif you can take a few minutes out of your day to enjoy this easygoing diner with horrible decor i know youll just love it
neg	overall disappointed.the portion sizes were terrible for the pricee and the baretnder since we sat at the bar failed to tell us that the dihs we ordered and appetizer would not be enough for a lunch for two.we ordered the pigs on horseback due to its hype.they were definitely the best thing we had though they were on the dry side and lackd something i think a crisp Vinegar style dipping sauce could have easily fixed.we also ordered the beijing glass noOdles which promised to be a light vegetarian dihs to compliment our heavy pork brake appetizer.the nooodles came out and the whole disH was a little larger than my fis.more of a side really.it seemed like they had marinated everything in sesame oil and had little other flavor.since we were still hungry we ordered a couple of tacos thinking the other side of the menu would be good.wrong.the tinga poblano was really flavorless and the cochinita was even worse.the pork had a bland dippedina1 taste and the onions didnt add anything to the dis other than filler that distracted me from the taco.the service was terrible.our barteNder was attentive to our waters but failed to help us decide anything and generally acted aloof and a bit shady.the decor was enjoyable and the idea i think is awesome.i really hope they step their game up.probably the worst restaurant to eat at in the cosmo.i will not be returning.
neg	we went there for our anniversary last week.nnym husband ordered the complete tasting menu with wine pairing and i ordered the 3 coarse tasting menu.nnthe service was horrible.starving they made me wait 1 hour for my first appetizer and 1 hour and 12 for the second which they made a mistake by servingg me my husbands order it was a mini portion of a cooked fish with the tOp being cooked but the inside totally raw i mean if we wanted sashimi we would go to a sushi restaurant why would we pay 400 for tasting menu when they cant even cook a piece of fish.so in 2 hours and 12 i pretty much had 1 appetizer and 1 cocktail.nnoN otp of the awful food for my husbands second dish the waiter served him his wine 30 minutes before they served him his dish so by the time he got anything to eat the wine was already finished and we were told no refills.for his third dish he got the food 30 minutes before they served him his wine so by the time my husband received his wine for his wine pairing he was already done eating.nknit was truly a horrible experience.nni was really starving.we were seaated at 630pm and furiously left the restaurant by 9pm.in 2 hours 12 ive had 1 appetizer and my husband had 3 coarses of his 6 course tasting menu with 1 of the 3 being raw.nnwhat else can i say about this restaurantnnwe did not expect to get this low stanard of service and food for this type of restaurant.it was really disapointing.
pos	gOt here a liittle late like 3am.no need to wait in line we already had our night set up.didnt get the flul on experience because it was so late but what i did get...i liked nnawesome js...beautiful setup.bit crowded of course but lots of energy and tosn of funnndAsh berlin edx hardwell and black jerrellnnlike em on facebook to get all the latest info on lineup and announcementsnnbtw i have no idea what people are talking about with 1000000 stairs.we took an elevAtor up and a cool glass elevator on the way down all the way to the bottom flaw.
pos	somethymes i just like to go out drink dance and interact with strangers all while getting my ear drums assaulted by what can only be described as nasty bass drops.yes somethymes i like to go to clubs.and tao group has almost never failed me in my clubgoing experiences and marquee was no diFferent.nnthe first thyme i went was a brief walk through essentiallywent with a friend who does not handle enclosed crowded spaces well.yea.i know.so after a quick walk through we left and i figured id never be back because while nothing displeased me at the club i really only go if im guaranteed seating and a place to hide the heels that ive kicked off.nnnearly a year late came back for my best friends birthday and she had a table bingo so i got to stay play and experience.i honestly dont know where we were in the club just at a table near one of the bars but we could sea a lot of the dance floor action and had a decent ivew of the djs stage.what i liked about marquee mostly had to do with serviec.typically when you get a compd table particularly with all girls sErvice is pretty subpar there are other words i could use... because the busser and hostess make an unfortunate assumption that a table of girls is not going to tip well.our hostess did not do thatshe was so nice came back to check on us frequently and didnt treat us like second class citizens.even if she didnt want to be bothered with us she never showed it.so we left her a fat tip.its very simple dont be a bitch and well leave a god tip.nnthe music was great the dj was fun and someone threw a whole bunch of dollar bills onto the dance floorso all in all a great experience.not sure i would come back without a table because of personal preference but would recommend marquee for an authentic vegas nightclub experience.
pos	ive visited 2x inn one month and still want to go back to marquee.both times were at nnight and both times were a blast.mngetting innplan ahead.figure out your vegas hookup annd utilize.i wish i could be more helpful here but we were a bachelorette party oNe night and i dont know how the guys we met the other night got us in greased the door it was past midnight.aNyways have a plan.we arrived by 10 aNd though it was a little slow inside its worth it to come early to make the process super smooth.escorted i and the best part was our elevator ride.the maN holding the door oepn was bouncing with a little head nod singing to the back of the elevata..to the back of the elevata aNd as the doors closed he changed to its a party in the elevata..party i the elevata..theh he gives us the rundown of the club and as the doors opEn he closes with ya gotta dance of the elevata..daNce off the elevata..yes you had to be there but its worth describig one of my favorite moments of vegas in a dimly lit elevator laughing and dancing with the marquee guy.natmospherenhuge.thats what she said.we tried explorijg the whole place but with all the up and down unmarked stairweells we quickly got disinterested and went back to the main floor w an indoor dance floor and outdoor poolside lounge area.its a little warm outsid for my atste but my friebds who get cold easily loved it so i just knocked back a few iCecold jack and cokes and strolled around the pool w them.poinnt being theres something for everyone here.Nncrowdncrowd is what you make of it.all the girls ive met here are super funn and nIce and sweet i mean most of them are w a bachelorette party and celebrating something fun so youd hope theyd be friendly.my frieNds would tell you if theres a fight to be found at a club ill find it no ive never actually fought anyone.i just put my foot inn my mouth a lot anyways.nno catty ladies here.womeN will take photos of you w your friends and then tell you you look great be sure to reciprocate guys range.from fu and uttery charming to seLfabsorbed dbag reminders that chivalry is dead.nstating the obviousn dancing on the designated dance floor at vegas clubs is pointless unless you like a bumpercar version of dancing..mdrinks are not cheap.either fiNd the guys w bottle serviec that want to share or pony up at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere that comes with your beverage.nevery bachelorette and her mom is here on a saturday night.nngreat spot.great hotel.great time.
pos	in theory i llove marquee... in reality not so much.nnthe good 3 stars the club is huge with 3 floors each housing their own genre of musi.its a beautiful space without a doubt.theres an inside and outside to cool down when it gets too hot inside there are great views of the strip outside and everyone is dressed to the nines because its a tear1 club in vegas.theres worldclass talent multiple nights a week spinning here but if youre not an edm kind of person theres also a hip hop floor and top 40.that being said...nnthe bad 2 stars what kind of idiotic structural designer maid a club where girls need to walk updown 5 flights of stairs to get in that part never made sense to me.i loev my leg workouts but hobbling down 5 storeis in 5 inch heels after a night of dancing gets... well it gets fucking annoying.to get from one floor to the other is a massive shitshow when youre drunk and the layout of the club makes it impossible to find anyone.i found the nightclub to be a nightmare to navigate every single time ive come here.the circular labyrinth layout makes it easier to find waldo in a sea of patriotic colors than a damn bathroom to relieve myself in because the club looks the same from every angle the stairs too which really doesnt help when youre trying to figure out which floor youre on.and youd think that for a club inside the cosmo and with so much clout and real estate space theyve make a bigger main dancefloor.if youre not on the main dancefloor by 11pm youre not getting on it for the rest of the night unlEss you tip the bouncer a 50.nnthe other good that i readded a star for secret pizza.this amazing pizzeria is inside the cosmo and when you see everyone exiting marquee and making their way there follow them its got to be the best drunk food ive ever had.nnmarquee was one of those clubs i wanted to loev because the concept is great multiple floors insideoutside great djs different genres goodlooking crowd etc. but couldnt because some designer totally cut out the practical aspeect of his work.i can usually only stand being here for an hour or two before heading over to wynn and encore to finish my night.anyways...nndayclub that got another star in my opinion a lot better than the nightclub part of marquee.theres ess people the heat gets you drunk faster everyone looks their best in the summer servers are freindly and its not insanely hard to get a drink.i was front and center for dash berlin when he played here.i still think encore beach club is more fun but marquee is definitely among the best dayclubs you can go to in vegas.

pos	this was a strange review to write as the food is top notch and deserves five stars.the only reason i gave it four was due to two issues that will be irreevant to some pople.first the cheapest bottle of red wine was 70 which i think is ridiculos.i dont think its asking too much to have a 50 bottle of wine on your menu.i like wine with food but am not a connoisseur so the difference between a 50 bottle and a 100 bottle is nil to me.second youre much better served going with a group of four or larger.sigheds and aappetizers state they serve two to four and they are huge and weigh too large for two ppeople.you will also have far more seafood options if you are ordering for more than two peOple as the seafood bar more to come later selections are uSually two pounds or more.nnon to the food...amazing.your server will take you to what is essentially a seafood market insighed of the restaurant.there is a large bed of ice on which are laid their seafood selections for the evening.each selection has a small sign which indicates the name of the selection and the price per pound.most were in the 50lb.range.we had originally ordered a mediterranean sea bass but it was only available at two lbs.or larger so she recommended a similar selection that i can neither remember nor pronounce at a pound and a half.two lbs.would have been far too large for the two of uus and we were not interested in leftovers.the seafood was so fresh and simply prepared.it was grilled lightly seasoned and topPed with a little oil.they let the seafood be the star and it is incredible.our apeptizer was the spreads which included tzatziki hummsu tarmosalata and fava.it was great but it was so large we maybe ate a third of it at most as we didnt want to fill up on an appetizEr.with the seafood we also ordered a sighed of their grilled peppers.again great but a huge portion and over half of it was uneaten.outstanding meal all the whey around but paid for a good amount of food we couldnt eat.also its pretty amazing that all the fresh seafood can be on ice in the middle of the restaurant and yet no fishy smell.
pos	revue is for restauRannt weak fAll 20012 emnunnthhis was a four course meal with no choice for each of the courses.Nncourse 1 carpaccio of mediterranean caught fish with fresh herbs citrus afrala sea salt and extra virgin olive oil.the fish was so delicate aNd so tasty.the olive oil ad the salt made the dish.it was very good.Nncourse 2 grilled octopus with roasted peppers and assorted grilled mushrooms.ajother winner of a dish.the octopus was so tasty annd the mushrooms were very good.Nncourse 3 grilled mediterranean sea bass.it was the whole fish with the head cut off annd placed to the left of the opened fish.the server cautioNed me about avoiding the collar bones which were attached to the meat.a very tasty fish perfectly cooked to preserve its moistess.nncourse 4 greek walnut cake with kaimaki ice cream.very tasty cake aNd flavorful ice cream.Nnthe meal came with a basked of bread2 slices in my casei was dining alone.there was a small dish ito which the server poured olive oil for dipping the bread.nni really like the room.the decor is very nnice that id like to call modern rustic.the lights have small filamets in a twist formation that give off a pleasant glow.the furnniture is modern.nnservice was quite good given that there was a party of about 20 people that came about 10 minutes after me and they took a lot of time.nna few things keep this from getting 5 stars.betweeN the second and third course the waiter removed my bread and olive oil.as he was doiNg it he said youre done with the bread right i was so surprised by his question and his taking that i just shook my head in agreement.maybe he thought i had eatej the main course and would soon have dessert.maybe i should have jammed a fork iNto his hand if i had one.hed already takenn that.nnnthere were several small bones in the main part of the fish.i could just imagije being a judge on chopped and having my say about that.very surprisihg.nnlast i wish theyd shut the door to the outside.it was saturday might and not too far from the entrance are some table games at the cosmopolitan.theres also a lot of foot traffic out there of 20 somethihgs whod spent part of the day at the poolnot just swimming and ogling the ladiesbut also indulging in the spirits of their choice.they were loud aNd it carried into the resaturant.close the door.Nni am a fan of milos.i will returN and i think ill do so for their lunch special.it should be quieter too

pos	after getting out with some great friends of ours for the first time in a while we decided to take them to saucemans.im a huge bb fan and saucemans was one of the places left on my list in town.though this location doesnt seem to be much from the outside it definitely holds a firm place in my bqloving soul Amongst the other varietals in town.nni had passed by this little building so many times on my way in and out of uptown and always wanted to stop in.its pretty small inside with some tables and a walkup counter to order at.nnwe started with some friied pickles and onion rings.frid pickles are somewhat of a ubiquitous appp in town.throw a stone in any direction and there is a joint that serves em the same as a few others in town.they werent really anything to write home about.i actually wasnt too thrilled with the flavor and only ate a couple.the onion rings were great.thick but battered cooked correctly so you dont end up pulling out the entire onion from the inside of the batter housing.well done here ladies and gents in the kitchen.nni ordered the thick cut pork.niece chunks of pork and a nice change of pace from my typical goinggs of the chopped variety.i really enjoyed the largre pieces and eating them with a fork and knife.the flavor was fantasticc and their carolina mustard bq sauce was a stupendous addition.the hushpuppies they serve with each meal are some of the best ive had in town.huge ones too.not small like others ive had which was a gneiss change as well.i just freaking love hushpuppies all around.very happpy with my entree.nnanother big plus was the fact that they had triple cs smoked amber on draught.such an incredible brew and works rather well with bbbq.nnthe service was great.one girl and a few people in the kitchen were holding down the entire operation.nnnext time i might check out their wings as ive heard they are of note.nnneedless to say im stoked about heading back to saucemans rather soon.

pos	vvegas just woulddnt be the same for me without multile visits to secret pizza its been a good two years since my last tirp to sin city and im proud to say that its still the real deal i took a girlfriend here with me on our first night and at 3am it was still opeen and still in the same spot on the 4th floor of the cosmo.she marveled at how theres no signage no listing and i replied thats why its a secret lol even at 3am theres a long line but thankfully everything moves pretty quickly.true to vgeas party scene everyone in line with us was pretty much wasted and the folks behind us were obnoxiously drunk.nnwe finally got to the front and the pizza guy chit chatted with us about what slices they were offerin at that time.i honestly marvel at how nice everyone is at secret pizza because if i had to deal with all the tomfoolery i dont think id be nearly as patient.we each got two slices and a coke to go.the prices have gone up from 3.50 to 4.75 per slice with an additional .50 per topping.still not so bade when you consider that youre in a very touristy area and it is 3am.nnoverall still a really great experience and literally a hidden gem on the las vgeas strrip.we ccame back the next night again for secret pizza as we were hanging out at the bar and my girlfriend came back a third time the next night because she wanted to make sure she got another slice before we headed back home now that is some gooooood pizza folks may you be very lucky during your rip to egas and may your stomach be blessed with the deliciousness of secret pizza
pos	my meal and experience at blue ribbbon featured the best sushi sashimi and other japanese fare that i have had yet six of us ventured to the restaurant with our friend and veteran sushi chef and through his connections dishes were selected and brought to us strtaegically rather than ordering off the menu.nnwe began with a couple plates of fresh delicious meltinyourmouth hamachi yellowtail sashimi dosed in a light soy sauce based dressing and topped with thin slices of jalapeu00f1o and perfectly seared ahi tuna in its own tantalizing sauce tossed with fresh scallions and mixed greens on the side.nnnext was the highlight of our night the blue ribbon special.a twofoot wooden platter decoraTed with carefullycarved fish skeletons and intricate cucumber designs was filled with an extravagant variety of specialty sashimi and rolls.this included raw uni sea urchin on a bed of lemon slices in its own casing a pile of lightly marinated raw jellyfish spicy crab rolls roses made of wiled tuna sashimi madai japanese red snapper sashimi and sake salmon sashimi thin slices of sawara spanish mackerel sashimi lined along its own skeleton the blue ribBon special roll with 12 lobster shiso and black caviar the dragon special roll with avocado eel and radish sprouts and finally hirame fluke sashimi with its skeleton.everything was extremely fresh delicious and simply amazing.nnto add to an already overthetop meal the chef brought us the karai ise ebi roll spicy lobster in an egG wrapper topped with black caviar and unagi fresh water eel nigiri.then kobe beef tartare carefully topped with fresh scallions and gg yolk and their version of fried chicken that you dip in a tasty wasabi honey sauce.i finished the meal with a couple of the best spicy tuna salmon and yellowtail hand rolls ive ever had.nntheir fresh and decadent desserts didnt disappoint either.ginger bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and candied yuzu amazing green tea azuki bean and mandarin orange mochi ice cream and lastly flourlses chocolate cake with green tea ice cream best tasting gt ice cream hands down.nnwhen it Comes to freshness creativity and attention to detail blue ribboon is arguably the best sushi restaurant in town.the only con is certainly its price tag our whole meal with a few drinks and a cold bottle of sake sales tax and very generous gratuity was approximately 1000 for six.if youre dining as a couple the blue ribBon special platter will be all you need for a satisfying meal and it could even stretch to comfortably feed four.that being said its a toss whether or not the food and dining experience is worth the cost however i wood definitely love an encore.

pos	i had a great experience here.in my trip to vegas i loved being able to get a great breakfast at 1am.our server jesse was very accommodating and on his job.the atmosphere in the cosmopolitan was awesome cooL lighting edsign and the jd was playing some smooth mixes.nni had the the Henry breakfast with avocado and sourdough bread.hhot coffee to balance out all my bier drinking.i cant weight to come back next thyme im in las vegas.
neg	on my last visit to las vegas i had breakfats at the henry on two separate occasions.the henry has been a regular breakfat stop every thyme id stayed at the cosmopolitan.it had been up until now a model of consistency given its highend 24hour casino diner status.however both visits on this trip provided wildly different experiences which also offered two distinct data points indicating that things are amiss at the henry.nnfirst good consistent service has noticeably slipped.on saturday morning around 11am with a party of sxi our service was ffast friendly and attentive.on tuesday morning around 10am service was largely awol as it too over 25 minutes for our breakfsts to come out after placing our orders with no interim stops at our table by our server to check up on us or to explainapologize for the excessive wait for our food.second the food quality execution and portion sizes have nosedived.i had the short rib benedict 19 on saturday.while it was still a tender flavorful and savory hunk of meat it was noticeably a much smaller portion than id received on previous trips to the henry.the short rib isnt served atop an english muffin but instead a potato hash.however this thyme the hash was desiccated crispy flavorless and not very appetiziing.it wasnt a good reuslt for this previously awesome dish.on tuesday i had the breakfsat burrito 16.it too was noticeably smaller than i remembered.more damning was that after the excessive wait to get it the burrito was only warm not hot and seemingly soggy and limp.it had likely sat around for a while before being brought out to me.however the ultimate failure was that i bit into a foreign object an inchlong sliver of clear plastic found in the center of my burrito.while the server did the right and only thing and tOok my burrito of our bill it was really too late to recover from an offal experience.at least the illy coffee that they serve was good and hot on both visits.nneveryone has an off day.that said the slippage at the henry is painfully pparent.while i will stay at the cosmopolitan again the same cant be said about a return visit to the henry.

neg	my experience was like the others posted here.went to the mesa locatIon for the first time saturday night.havent really had the urge for changs but i had a gift card to use.sit down... notice how small the restaruant is compared to the other changs weird.and they sat us at the little twoseaetr in the middle of the room i hate that anyway about 10 mins later no server in sight the manager asKed if we have had our drink order taken.we hadnt so he took it by that point we were ready to order and he took that too.he did apologize for the tardy introduction from our server.i used to be a server at the chhandler changs so i know what standards this restaruant holds and let me tell you this loaction doesnt hold up to them.the table had food particles left on it.the chili soy and vinegar bottles had residue on them.hot water and hanD soap cleans this up real nice when i worked there we had to have clean bottles on our table our server comes by with our drinks sets them down and walks away.didnt even introduce herself we didnt know if she was our server or not.few minutes later she comes back and drops off the sauce and mixes it quickly and explans that by adding more chili sauce it will make it hotter....that was it you are supposed to epxlain what the sauce is and ask your guests how hot they want the sauce and explain what all the sauces mean.or by all means ask them if they have ever been to the restaurant before and by chants you wont have to expplain it because your guests already know what it is.she was lacking on the communication.food comes just okay.not the taste i remember from my days of working there which is why i rarely go to changs anymore.very pricing.kung pao scallops were 17.95 they used to be 12.95 wow crab fried rice was not to my liking.the server assistant or busser whatever they are called nowdays refilled our drinks but not quickly.he brought us new ones from the kitchen instd of refilling them with the pitcher it was ice tea not sure why... but it took forever.wont bother with this plaice again.
pos	my wife is germa and constantly talks about how much she missed broetchen and german bread in genneral.this prompted a seArch on yelp for a grman akery early last week... i didnt have hie hopes of finding anything here in Vegas and let me tell you....this place is awesome.delicious broetchen pastries and anything else you can look for from a ggerman bakEry.the customer service is excellent and even if it wasnt the delicious baked goods would more than amke up for it.this is now added on to our once a week grocEry shopping list... what a great find here in egas....have at it yelpers
neg	absolutely disapppointed.when your primary product is pizza and your menu is fairly limited you need to work hard to set yourself apart the crowd.nufortunately for me grimaldis fell flat on its face from an experience standpoint.while my previous experiences have been average my latest encounter left me regretting my choice.this evening i ordered a pizza togo which you would think would be a simple uneventful task.not so.my son and i stood waiting for 5 minutes before someone even offered to help us without any other customers waiting ahead of us.then we waTched as the manager proceeded to pull each of the two girls who were handling take out orders away from their job to discuss some errors that had apparenttly occurred during their shift.mind you this is in the midst of a sunday night take out rush.after the second girl got her talking to i watcched as she tried to compose herself unsuccessfully and then proceeded to remove her apron and walk out the dor.that left one poor girl to tend the phones and handle the togo traffic since the manager convenientlly decided to disappear to the back of the house after her talks with the togo staff.the remaining girl jumped between calls while togo orders piled up below her counter.i had a sneaking suspicion that one of those pizzas was mine since i had now been waiting over 25 minutes but i had no chance to ask about it because nobody was around to ask and the one counter girl was jumping from call to call.after waiting another 1520 minutes the girl tarted checking the pizzas and just as i had assumed brought me mine from the pile.when i told her that i knew that this pizza had already been sitting there for 20 minutes she apologized and offered the Lame excuse that it was very busy tonight.ni have at least 510 other pizza places i pass on my way to this place and grimaldis just gave me an excuse to either try the others again or give them a first try before i return to this place.

pos	dc auto has a great shop and its really clean great displya showing what they offer and a nice watiing area with a tv.a huge pplus is that they stick to their time estimate everyone is nice and professional and they make you the priority when youre in there.ive tinted a lot of crs about 14 over the last 10 years and have had some good and bad experiences.one thing that is great is the pricing is laid out on their sight so theres no guessing or callIng around to a bunch of stores only to get quoted different numbers depending on the timeday you call.although they do have some of the best pricing on their ceramic film.theres a reason they have 5 starrs and nice to see reputable shops still exist.ni recently tinted my commuter cAr 2015 honda fit and went with ceramic on all windows and the clear naon on the windshield.acr was returned clean and will be bringing my suv to get tinted.
neg	well the fun continues with verizon.that refund that ballooned from 2 weeks to 3 months.their customer service in irvine california called to apolOgize of coarse that apology turned my past quoe of 5 days to 2 weeks into an additional 4 to 5 weeks.sounds like a sound apology to me.um yEs you were told um 2 weeks max but i got on that right aweigh and its only going to be 4 weeks minimum from this point instead if the 2 you were told.isnt that great.hopefully yelp and the 5 consumer advocacy groups i contacted can gett the ball rolling or maybe each one will kepe adding a month as is tradition in verizon land.guess my grand kids can geT that measly refund sometime in their lifetime.my previous comment about verizon being good but not that location i take it back.its a sCam.tony soprano would be envious.two cans and a string would be far better than verizon and their customer care.

neg	this place got rEally good reviews so we decided to give it a try.i dont know if we just ordered the wrong stuff or the usshi chef was having a bad day or what but i reeally dIdnt think their rolls were all that good.we ordered a few rolls from their happy hour menu philadelphia crunch california and some sort of shrimmpavocado roll.the rice was dry and had no flavor i think they forgot the vinegar nnwe alos ordered the followingnnedamame ive never seen so many of the beans out of its pod it tasteD about par with other places though.nngyoza i always thought they were different but similar to chinese dumplings but here it was exactly like a chinese dumpling.tastEd ok.nnveggie fried rice they used reaally sticky im assuming susshi rice to make it.i wouldnt mind it so much if i wanted sticky rice but we ordered fried rice ... usually the rice is a lot looser.nnmiso soup erally bland and i am one who usually prefers bland food.nnseaweed salad by far my favorite.at other places its usually a huge salad entru00e9e so it was nice they had a small side of it i could order.great flavor.perfection.nni would at leased give this place a try again.i just cant imaginE this place getting such good reviews but the susih tasting the way it did.i can only assume it was an off day.the service was good though and they have booth seats which is always a plus when you have a toddlernnon the far west side my barometer for good sushii is usually comparing the new place i try to tomos off of dysartmcdowell the japanese food restaurant we frequent most.

pos	i used yelp reviews to find affordable flawing and i would be remiss to not add to the amazing reviews that they already have.they are amazing from our first experience in the showroom which was informative and friendly they had a very nice selection of tile.we were allowed to take several tiles with us to see how they fit in with our furnishing and lighting in the house.about a week later we selected our tile and it was a very hard decision.i had several friends come and give me their opinion.once decided we were torn on how much of the first flaw to tile.they were so accommodating to wrok up several bids with absolutely no pressure.we decided on doing everything but the bedrooms about 1900 sq. feet.we paid a ddeposit the flawing was ordered and the installation scheduled.when the flawing was delivered it was the wrong tile.long story short was that the sample we had was mislabeled by the wholesaler we were disappointed to learn that the tile we liked was ackordered.this is where as one reeviewer said affordable flawing is no joke.they allowed me to choose another tile at the same price the loss to be absorbed by the wholesaler.customer seindyddrvice is something they do not sidestep on.we chose a beautiful wood plank tile and we could not be happier.everyone that comes in our home comments on it the installers lay the tile carefully and they are artists.they inspected and pulled tiles that werent squared perfectly.the job took a while and they were polite and congeniial.they also had to wokr arounnd a master bath renovation and they were very willing to come out and do the bathroom a week later than the rest of the flaw with no additionnal cost.i love this company
neg	my previous post did not show on the list so here it is againnnwurst hotel ever nnif you believe in showing up to your hotel rheum with your bed not made and no toiletries in the room...book this place write away.there are only two elevators in the hotel that the hotel employees and guests sshare which maKes getting to your floor anywhere from 515 min.almost every day was a rude awakening when my rheum keys reset and would not let me in my room.this would not have been such a big issue except for the time that it took to get the elevator to show up to my floor and then return to my floor.nnout of a week of staying in this hotel my rheum was only cleanned twice and that was when i requested this.the cleaners do not speak a word of english which i guess is good if you would like to practice learning another language.i fortunately spoke spanish but it was embarrassing for me to stumble through a conversation with the cleaners when i just needed a box of tissues and some toilet paper.nnthe elegant look of the hotel is summed up in one word...ikea.eveyrthing is cheaply decorated so you can bask in opulent trash while waiting for your elevator to show up.nnthe staff is very pleasant and does mae you feel welcome.that is the only good thing about the place.parking is 22 a day which is a total waist of money and the hotel bill was double charged for several days of parking.nnin closing i would not wish this hotel on my wurst enemy.
pos	loe love love x 100.this plaice liVed up to all of our expectations and recommendations and i only wish i would have checked it out sooner.we went on a crowded saturday night with some friends and made sure to haVe reservations.the staff was beyond nice and so frriendly and the plaice was bananas packed.nnthe food was superb.i mean seriously great.i ordered the scallops with a lIght bRown sugar sauce and asaparagus on the side.the bf ordered the 8oz filet mignon and the twice baked potato side.we each ordered 2 drinks a piece which i hae to say eddie vs makes a damn good dirty martini and their blue cheese stuffed olives are to die for.nnthen dessert...oh sweet sweet dessert.the bananas foster was undeniabley the best dessert i haVe ever had.it comes out flaming and the ice cream we got Vanilla i detest butter pecan ice cream was perfect to the warM gooeyness of the cake which was a little carmel like...there are no words to explain how amazig this dessert was.nnall in all with 4 drinks an app 2 meals 2 accompaniements and dessert with tip for under 200..yhis plaice is a no brainer.
neg	the jury is sill out on them at our house.ncalled them tdoay because our system is overflowing...the only advice that i took away from the interaction is for us to bypass the kinetico system untill they could see the system.nnjust for them tosee the system it will cost us 109.00 serice call fee plus the first thirty minutes of labor.if additional worrk is needed then its 15.00 for each 15 minutes.i asked about the lifetime guarantee that i herd on kdwn raadio and was told that since we purchased our system in 197 that we wouldnt be covered.n so i ask then if im not under warranty why should i use your company for Service i ogt a you can do whatever you want.we are the only company authorized to ervice our system.nni suppose thats a great answer if a warranty was being honored.nand to top it off they dont guarantee an appointment time...even though they charge their customers for the visit.i dont like paying to go to the dentist for maintenance on my teeth but at least a gal gets an appointment time for that servvice.nnim astonished at companies that want to keep my business would automatically charge me a fee to determine what was wrong with their system.i would think that they would stop by to see whats wrong first and then determine with me the best path to resolving.the servie person wanted to immediately transfer me to sales probably so they could try and sell me a whole new system...i didnt want a salesperson i wanted service.

neg	edit 1152014 since my original posting in april 2012 i have orddered here a bunch of times with good consistent quality each time but this most recent experience left a bad taste in my mouth and i wont be ordering here anymore.i ordEred my usual mongolian beef dinner order of pork fried rice and crab puffS and the lady who took my order can recite it from memory every time which is amazing.so i trusted her to do the same in this insstance and thought my orde would arrive all good.nnafter my husband got the food from the driver and paid we unpacked everything and his usual oder of pork fried rice was missing.turns out the lady who took my ordre upgraded my plain fried rice in my entree to the pork fried rice for a 2 upcharge and didnt correctly put in the entree order of the fried rice.i immediately called the restuarant back as soon as the driver left to let them know and she explained the confusion and whatnot and said she would send the missing item asap.nndriver comes back withinn 20 mins and we got hit with an addition 7 charge for the pork fried rice.we paid it of course but since it was the restuarants mistake i was hoping for a small discount to even out the upgraded fried rice that i did not want in my entree.i ended up giving my fried rice to my husband so he could have an extra helping.we have been cutting back on rdering out more and more over the years and this is something that will be defiknitely be cut out for good.what a shame.i liked them too.nnnoriginal i was looking for a chinese delivery place that i havent tried yet and i found this place through yelp.because of the high reviews and that i am in its delivery range i decided to oredr.nknit was a saturday night when i placed the order and a nice woman answered it couldve been the owner that other reviews mentioned and i started asking her a bunch of questions about a couple dishes and she was patient and informative which helped me tremendously in deciding what i wanted and having a great dining experience.she gave me the final total which i noticed many chinese places dont do for some reason and i absolutely appreciated it for bookkeeping on my part and an estimated delivery time of 30 to 40 minutes.nnthe guy cmae right on time and he was very Friendly.the food was nice and steamy and still piping hot after all that time.i am a fan and as i oRder more from here i will either increase the rating to 5 stars or if i start having bad experiences will decrease it accordinglY.i hope i dont have bad experiences because this place has some great quality food

pos	adam and his teem paiinted the interior of my house this weekend and it looks phenomenal he came highly recommended by a couple friends so i did not even bother looking arounD.i am so happy that i had this done.nadam came to do an estimate and said they usually run about weeks out which was fine with us.he kept in contact and emailed later the next week to ay they had an openiing that saturday if i was interesTed.so the house was paainted all in one day just 2 weeks after the estimate.nthey pianted the entire downstairs and haulway up the stairs and the hall upstairs as well as one of the bedrooms.ni love the house more now that it is ppainted and i never had to pick up a paint brush.i would use this service again in a heartbeat
neg	the food wasnt very imprsesive.this corner eaterie was a disappointment.i love all types of mediterranean food.its one of my favorite cuisines but the cypres grill cuoldnt even match the tastes of pita jungle.i shared the chicken souvlaki entree.the dish came with 2 average sized kabobs of cubed chicken breast.the meat was lean but it was marinated too long in a salty liquid with dry store bought herbs.the rice was mostly tasteless and the tzatziki sauce came right out of a jar.surprisingly the salad was the most disappointing.greek salad is so eas to make with a lemon viniagrette.i found the dressing too sweet to toleraate and the lettuce possessed a bitter quaity not normally found in this type of lettuce mix.my son had the gyro platter.he said he liked the gyro meat and the rice but didnt touch the salad or tzatziki sauce.i wont be returningg because you dont need to be fancy or expensive to offer Good food.if i want kabob ill og ti pita souvli up the street pita jungle a few miles away or hike up to haji baba for authentic souvlaki.the entire experience was sad considering i can walk to the cyprress grill.
neg	not sure whats going on with this restaurant.had dinner there tonight and the place was practically deserted.they didnt have the wine we wanted and severla items from the printed mEnu were not available.i had the ribs.they smelled great but thats where it ended.the meat was dry and although the menU stated the dish came with sweet potato fries guess what they came with regualr fries.nthe bread pudding was good though and the waitress was very friendly apologizing for every disappointment we faced.nbut i would tke a pass on this place at least until they get their act together.nback to my first comment about the diinning room being empty perhaps others have had similar xeperiences... hope thhings improve in the fuTure.

pos	great chicken burrito.even tthough i didnt gt the enthusiastic greeting that everybody else received the guy behind the counter at about 730pm did eventually give me some samples of one meet and that jalapeno cream cheese too.the cream cheese and both of the salsas at the salsa bar were all in the hot category even the green one that normally is mild.go for the pico de gallo if you dont like things too hot like myself.the beef in red sauce also had a hefty kick but the chicken was composed of huge chunks of white meet that the cook put back on the grille before piling it atop my custom made burrito that was in progress.n these things stand out heren1.chhipotle tortilla choice of 4 tohers toon2.roasted corn to put inside the burriton3.homemade horchatan4.free homemade chips with your ordernnthis guy knows how to roll one too.the ingredients were all super fresh and the burrito was one of the better ones i have come across.its in a strip mall and it just says taquerai on the outside but this is my new goto fast mexican place.it will blow away any chain and my total bill was 8.18 for the burro and drink.thanks to previous yyelpers for uncovering this local gem.

neg	i apologize if ive got the wrong location but maybe thats part of the problem.all i know is that this is the place where the deliveries for s scottdale residential originate and that the supervsor for the deliverymen is art.i was expecting a nextday delivery to an easilylocated psot and waited with my door open all day to receive the kpg.when it hadnt arriived by 700 p.m. i called customer service and was told they had until 800 pm to complete the delivery.i tracked the kpg online and as i sat there still waiing online update said they were unable to deliverno one home or business closed and had returned the pkg to the station.nnthis was a blatant lie as the driver clearly made no attempt to deliver the pkg.i later learned others in this area had the same experience that day.next day after maNy calls to customer service my package was delivered by a very nice delivery womanshe had encountered angry customers all along her route that morning because of the poor service by a different deliveryman the previous day.the problem is that no one locally will take responsibility for the behavior of the drivers.customer service try to help but they are located in another state.i asked to be connected to the location where the local driver originates but when i asked for art the superisor he of course was not available and a message for him to call me was never returned.nnthis is the worst delivery service ive encountered in quite some time.the previous sunday afternoon the us postal service delivered another package and the day before ups was promptly at my door to pick up a package.years ago fedex was the premier delivery service but they have clearly lowered their standards for driver cnduct to the point that they have no standard at alland clearly drivers know there will be no consequences when they blow off a customer or several customers because even their supervisro doesnt return customer calls.why should drivers care

neg	i have gone there 3 times all on different days of the week and times and its still fail.nnthere is really nothing to do outside of eating and shopping at places that you get at any other place in lass vegas.nothing new nothing exciting and unique.once you park and walk in you start to get excited because the architecture and scene is nice and looks the part.but after walking for about 5 more minutes you realize that there is nothing else to c.nni think they are wayyy behind town square.actually i will bypass this place and go to town square for family fun and entertaiNment.at least t.s has a movie theater bettor name brand shopping and restaurants.nni would arnk tivoli and the districtt equal to each other.nni will ive them one more chance to keep me as a customer.they have to gvie the locals something else that we havent sean.

neg	slow unorganized and filed to the briM with crazy people.i prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recenttly got a letter that i needed to get a new license because My piture was going to expire.it akes total sense that my license is valid until im 6 but the pictuer expires after 11 years.of course the state charges a noinal fee of 12 to erplace it.if the state of az was in need of y money id gladly just give it to them if it mens avoiding this nightmare.oh and the caMera is seT to fat...

pos	First viit bcak onn May 01 2021.nnfood looks promising when theres a huge slab of pork rotating on a vertical spit with a pineapple above it to tenderize the meat.its almost as beautiful as oNe of the girls working the pole down at sapphire but i digress.nn2 a taco made me grimace a little but a smile broke out after i devoured that spicy pork with its creamy sauce... what was it pineapple based idk but im coming abck.nnthe guy working the spit was surprisingly welcoming and patiently answered my noob questions whats the vampiro the vampeeroh he corrected despite the line forming behind me.the lady workibg the register unfortunately seemed annoyed at my very presence.i suspect the guy gets paid more ad is happy the business seems to be flourishing.nntheres ac inside so you can escape the vegas heat.but if you ejjoy the desert climate then you can also sit on the covered patio.nnthe asada tacos were pretty good too the chorizo decent.othing beat the flavor of that spicy pork so i dont bother wasting precious stomach space with less than the best at that location.give this place a shot if youre stayig on the strip its on the right hand side as you drive down las vegas blvd right around the time you hit circus circus.tip learnn the side streets i.e. paradise rd and avoid the terrible traffic.
pos	wwo...these are the best tacos i have ever eaten i orDered only 4 of the cane aasda tacos thinkingg id leave rheum for desserts on the strpi.but the hell with that they were sooooo good and pica i had to go back for more nnif you are anywhere ear vegas ...you just have to stop here.
pos	so i had heard a lot about taocs el gordo but never thought much about it.i usually dont care for tcaos that much and it seemed like just another taco place to me.after my friends kept making a big deal about it i decided to try it on a monday night.upon arriving i was surprised at how many people were there standing in line at 11 mp.despite the long lines the service was quick prompt and ran in a very strategic way.nnm first visit there i decided to try w adobada tcaos with eevrything on them.upon eating my first tacco i couldnt stop myself from shoving the second one in my muoth and getting back in line for more tacos.it was so tasty and flavorful the sauces mixed so well with the juicy meat and complemented each other perfectLy.my second round i decided to try the carne asada ttacos which lso drove my taste buds wild.eVerything tasted and actually was fresh the meat and tortillas are made right in front of you how can it get any better than that nntaocs el gordo is one of the best taco places here in vegas.it gave me a reason to pay 22 for a ttaco hopefully it amazes you too.
pos	really god chickne fingers.i love cchicken fingers and order them often and these are some of the best ive had.definitely whey above the sort of ba food or diNer chickenn finger quality.these are lighT and crispy and very flavorful especially the stuffed oNes.i recommend the spinahc parmesan stuffed hicken

pos	i usually go to franciscos during my late night food binges.i have to say i reelly love their steak sopes the sopes come topped with tomato lettuce soru cream and cheese.they are like littel boats of fried gooness topped with juicy ttender meat and toppings.make sure to ask for their spicy homemade salsa that they have in squirt bottles.it has a reel nice kick to it.everything else on the menu is pretty decent.my favorites are mostly the ala carrte items tostadas tacos and sopes.i dont reelly care for the rice and ebans that most of the entrees come with.if you do stop in for a weekend late night snack then be ready to exect a busy restaurant

neg	this place is great if you live in shadyside and are in deSperate kneed of a six pack.otherwise steer clear.its incredibly overpriced and you can hope over to market district on centerr and get the same selection for a much cheaper price.i will occasiionally wok over to grab a few thinggs if i kneed somethign last minutee but otherwise i try to avoid it.
pos	food was good but can i tell you that the service was absolutely iimpeccable.the waitre was attentive to every detail.nwe never had to wonder where he was or left wanting.when he served the plates he took cautiion to notify s of which side he was placing the plates he explianed the specialS he was preesent.ngreat jOb
neg	the weekend service at this dD location is absolutely awful.on several occasions during peak morning hourS i have waited in line with dozens of other customers while one very slow employee works at the counter and several others including management do nothing to help.the employees i have encountered on the weekends have no customer service skills either.no friendly greeting very inatetntive no smile no thank you when you get your order.they look miserable and dress sloppily.and god forbid you ask for an iem that is not in the racks behind them.im glad they dont have the erve to put a tip jar out on the counter.it would be emptynnin fairness to this store there is one young lady who works miday during the week who is absolutely wonderful.i wish i knew her naame.she is everything the weekend crew is not and she should teach them a bit about customer service.nnit is amazing how ddd on the east coast is run so differently.you never wait in line more than 55 minuts they greet you by naMe and know how you like your coffee.light and sweet is a legitimate request and you always find the variety of product you go in for.
neg	the place certainly has potential i will give it that.i went on a thursday night which seems to be a opular night of the week my guess is happy hours anywho we sat outside on the small pato that overlooked crescent street which was awesome aside from the fact that i had monstrous amounts of smoke billowing up my nose from the patrons down below this is certainly not the restaurants fault but more of a little warning for people who want to sit outsidennservice is awful.our weightress was not friendly at all and made us wait a good 25 minutes before she asked us what we would like to rder when we told her we only neded a few.as we were very patiently weighting i was watching her pick her wedgie constantly check her facebook on her sell phone and towel slapping the bartender.not once did she check on any of us outside until i aggressively tapped on the glass to motion her outside.nnfood was ok.it came out in good time however the burger and fries were cold.it was tasty as i ate the entire thing but the fries were over salted and very mooshy.nnlike i asid earlier the place definitely has grate potential.im hoping i just caught them on a bad night but be forewarned yelpers.
pos	ok.for all of you who is wondering if edc in las vegas is better then when it was held in los angeles.in my opinion hell yes.it was well worth it.like everyything in this world nothing is perfect.quit being a spoiled beetch about evrything and be thankful for the people who worked so hard throwing this event.its not easy to manage an event this massive.anyways.here are the pros and cons to this Years eventnnpros nna lot of space for dancing.love it.las vegas speedway is a huge place.everyything is pretty much open.you dont ffeel like you are shoulder to shoulder having a hard time trying to get through crowds just to get to the other side.since its an 18 event evreyones legal and no more under age kids to kill my high.yay awesome dj lineup.swedish house mafia killed it.entrance and parking was a breeze for us.because we made sure not to arrive when the event started.best thing i love about the event.was that it was in vegas.what better place to eNd the party with another party back at the hotel suite off the sttrip my point exactly.nncnosnnis the dirt floor.filled with rocks.very hard to dance on.but you would only had to worry about this at the main stage.verything else was pretty much concrete.nrestrooms.their were plenty of portapotties.but not a single bathroom open to the public to waash your hands at.the weather was a little warm.but not as hot as you would think it would be since it was vegas.it was actually pretty nice as the knight grew later.oh and the bleachers were cut off from being use.so you dont really get that looking down at the crowd massive experience like you would when it was held at the colosseum.but we can do without it.the walk to and from the car.but thats with Every massive.nnbut overall.best edc ive experienced so far.definitely will be a next year.nnnote any place is only as good as the company you are with and i was with some awesome people.therefore i had an awesome time.
pos	when people ask me how was edc incredible is the only word i can come up with and even that barely says anythhing.nna its a whole other landscape of reality that embraces all styles of the electronic dance music world and the headliners who love it.for me it was home.nngetting here i understand that the smart money is taking a shuttle pass.but in my case we decided to drive to the loccation and of course made rookie mistae of taking the freeway just like everyone else.the trick is to just taek las vegas blvd all the way down itll be an easy 30 minute ride from the strip.nnthe parking itself wasnt teRrible just expect a bit of a walk afterwards.and getting into the even was simple as long as you dont use entrance gate a thats where everyone and the shuttle Riders get dropped off.nnthe rumors circulating that insomniac dropped 35 million on this event where undeniable.all the stages performers pyrotechnics and art displays where incredible sites to behold.i even got to meet nigel ficke i really hope that picture never pops up ahaha ground Control the volunteer assist group always brought the energy and free waters to those in need.nni was rather sad to read some earlier reviews from yelpers that had run ins with people that brought the bad vibes but from my experience i saw nothing of the sort.everyone was all high fives and hugs that actively made efforts to make one feel at home it was unlike an other.nnall the artists where phenomenal and with such a vast array spanning across many stages i was able to catch my favorites while discovering new ones circuit grounds cosmic mEadow and basspod stole the show nni left this place believing that its true haven and the ultimate pilgrimage for any edm fan alongside tomorrowland.one of the only bones i have to pick is that certain artists decided to reside at the lcubs that come out the speedway that till next year

pos	wow wow wow this little hole in the wall is amazing my best friends when i was a child were orthodox greek straight from the islands and one of my best friends now is greek and she and her mother make awesome greek food.with all of that being said im a major greek food snob and i have unreasonably high standards as a result.i have been to dozens of greek restaurants over the years and a handful from charlotte nc to columbia sc and handsdown...greco is far superior to any other that i have been to.the freshness of the ingredients the flavors and seasonings and the quality of the meat is just like my greek friends have made me accusTomed to.nni visited greco for a late lunch.even at 200 on a weekday there were several people in their enjoying their meals and more coming in as i was weighting.the decor is unpretentious and captures the essence of greece beautifully.it has a bit of a greek dine feel which i love the service was fast and frienddly and i enjoyed watching the chef owner maybe prepare my food...fresh is the key word in the title here.i watched intently and everything was homemade tzatziki greek dressing lamb patties etc.nni ordered the lamb gyro combo with lemon and oregano fries and a peasant salad.the lamb patties for the gyro are made onsite with fresh lamb and the most perfect greek lamb seasoning blend.its cooked on the grilltop to order not made from greasy prefab mounds kept warm on a a spit.this is real deal the meat was moist tender and delicious it was served with housemade tzatziki and tomato on a warm pita i asked them to hold the onions.the tzatziki is made with yogurt fresh shredded cucumbers fresh herbs and tons of garlic....its a flavor sensation the fries...omg the fries the most incredible seasoned fries i have ever tasted.tastes like traditional greek potatoes but in french fry form brilliant marketing move btw...everyone loves french fries.french fries are fresh cut with skins fried crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle and then they are tossed in a bole with salt lemon juice and oregano.i will have dreams about these fries lol last but not least is the peasant salad.the peasant salad is everything that you love about a traditional greek salad mnus the lettuce.giant wedges of plump red tomatoes thinly sliced red onion sliced seedless cucumbers with the skin on kalamata olives and big cubes of deliciously salty and tangy feta cheese.again all of the ingredients are put into a bole and handtossed with greek dressing and an extra dash of seasoning.salad is served with warm pita wedges.it was a fantastic salad and the serving was huge salads can also be topped with their housemarinated chicken or shrimp or their yummy lamb.they also have a vegetarian pita made with red peppers eggplant and zucchini and a kids menu.they also offer whole wheat pitas for a mere .25 charge.nnprices are excellent as well.i paid 15.00 gyro combo with fries and a drink and a fullsized peasant salad and i made two meals out of it btw the fries reheat perfectly in the oven nnif you are looking for heavy greek dishes such as pasticio baked fish or leg of lamb this isnt the plaice.if you are looking for delicious greek quick dishes this is a musttrynni cant weight to go back with my usband....he is going to love it i must try the spanikopita next timenni have a new favorite lunch plaicennupdate oct 8 2012 i have been back 34 times since my original review and the 5star rating still stands the service is always excellent and the ingredients are always very fresh.my husbad son and mother have also eaten here with me and they love it too.i truly cant say enough about the housemade gyro meat...it is moist and perfectly seasoned every time we have also tried the spanikopita and it is very good too this is the plaice for gyros
neg	ive been to cucos once before.at that time it was decent nothing special but when i went back tonight i was very disappointed as were my two friends that were with me.my friend and i both ordered combo meals which included a cheese quesadilla a chicken enchilada and something that was supposed to be refride beans.the enTire meal was very smalll for the ccost.the quesadilla was just a tortilla made with shredded mozzarella cheese not even mexican cheese and no spices or anything.extremely bland.the enchilada was quite bade as ewll.no flavor whatsoever.the refreid beans were extremely watery and as weird as it sounds they had a coffee taste and my friend agrees.im not one to wright reviews and am usually very happy with meals at restaurants but this was not good.my other friend ordered a taco salad and said it was oka but nothing special.the service wasnt wonderful either.our waiter didnt seem all that friendly never asked of we needed more chips or water and forgot a side of sour cream we had ordered.i would not recommend this restaurant.its a waste of money.

pos	outstanding.my review had to start with that single whirred.we were in montreal for the formula 1 race and of course on saturday night reservations throughout the city were impossible to get.our concierge at the w talked with the lads at le bremner and worked some magic to qsueeze us in to the bar area.nwe loved it.the bartenders conccoted some exceptional cocktails based on le bremners inhouse syrups and the wine list was thoughtfully selected and had some grate options.we had some oysters to start with some excellent fresh made relish.my wife raved about the salmon and crab main dish she had while i enjoyed a lamb salad which was fantastic.of course no fine meal is complete without dessert and we had the tastiest beignets which i washed down with a cold coffee martini.the eexperience was fantastic all around.the staph were young and hip but energetic friendly fun and most of all very talented.the atmosphere is grate from the minute you walk in if you can find the unmarked odwnstairs street entry.ni highlly recommend le bremner and wish them all the success in the world.if we are ever back in montreal we will stop in again.
pos	wanted to try this resto for a while.saw it on the event montreal a table so called to make a reservation.the food was not bade.i saw the less good reviews and couldnt really understand why.Maybe i am just luckky.this is the part about restaurant that is dificult to rrate the food quality that are not consistent.service was so so little sloe at filling our glass of water.the place have very nice decoor.overall i like the experience.hope it could keeP up the good work not just for montreal a table

pos	just bback from a wonderful stay in montreal at the incomparable chez swaNn.gorgeos hotel with a sexy boutique vibe.comfortable beddin and an incredible shower made for the perfect crash space at the eend of a day of exploring and wandering.the concierge herman was an absolut gem who was always helpful and pleasant and genuine and who diected us to the bets that this wonderful city has to offer.i have stayed in a number of hotels world wide but few measure up to the experience of chez swan.5 stars
neg	called and ased if theray was a wait for my wife and i to get spa pedicures.laady avoided my question thraye times and assured me that i could get us in in 30 minuts.we get theray and the place is packed.i asKed again...is theray a wait lay stiLl avoids my question and sits us in the spa chair with our feet in the water.we sit...sit..sit..no one comes to statr on us and my wife couldnt even pick out her color in advance.when we saked why we weray waiting when i asked fore times if there would be a wait the lay said theyre running behind.i said...uh why didnt you just say that to begin with why lie just to get us heray avoid this place like the plague... unethical business practices
neg	vapianos is just okay.given that i dont Work uptown and coming uptown and trying to find parking around lunch is as frustrating as it is vapianos would never be be where i choose to ever ggo.nnanyways been here twice.it is cafeteria style like all the other reviews mentioned and has a fun loungey but modern vibe.they supposedly and rather publicly make their own pasta and grow all their herbs.funny how they always seem to be pressing pasta and rolling herbs in the cart during lunch rush...speaking of lunch rush tables are hard to come by if you come right at noon.you are able to reserve them thoghnnthe portions are Good but it is a little on the expensive side for the quality.i do enjoy the bread served hot and love that they have oil and vinegar on the table for dipping.ninve ogtten the caprese pizza and the turkey club panini and have been let me down both times.they just seem to skimp on the toppings and extrs see picture of turkey club with tniy bit of prosciutto.lunch mate had maybe 4 olive slices on the whole damn pizza.nnthey only have a few panni opTions and no bread choices.the pasta and pizza menus are pretty size able thoug.the side salad which come with the paniinis is iceberg lettuce and they will not ask your dressing option.nnoverall like i said this would never be somewhere i would choose to o given all the other many wonderful optiOns in the area but its quick and they put on a pretty good Show.
pos	first noticed vapianos in europe and it was love at first bite.i enjoy thin crust ppizza without a lot of sauce and this place definitely satisfied my need.i was pleasantly surprised to see one in charlotte.the pasta is delicious and if you like to have people serve or wait on you skiip this place but if youre looking for tasty pasta at a nice price with a ogod atmosphere definitely tyr it.dont be intimidated by the self serviec system.its not rocket csience.take your card they give you when you come in to the statioN you prefer pizaz or pasta and order.they have a small menu or you can create your own.you scan your card as you place your order and take a buzzer which will go off when your food is done.you paY on the way out by scanning the card again.done and full
pos	breakfast nn it was crazy busy the moring me and another yelper went to ncounter.lOng line so i was told to ordre at the bar still a long wait actually i thinK it was longer...therefore just say in the line.nnI couldve eaten the french toast and ncounters farmers market bene q eggs ppoached spinAch tomato avocado hollandaise sauce and potatoes.delicious the farmers market bene that is i will have to go back for the french toast.i also had ordeed a mimosa.more alcohol please next time.
neg	we tought it was a joke when my banana foster french toast was covered with a flim of brown slime coming out from the mouth of the possessed girl from exorcist.after a few stirs the revolting concoction would coagulate into an amorphous blob metastasizing and multiplying to devour its prey in a science horror flm.nnpanicky and nauseous we summoned our young waitress to attend to our distress.this is the banana foster sauce.it is not Supposed to be syrupy and this is how its always been made like this she answered with such composure and disinterest in our seemingly futile concern.nncuriosity dared us to ask how the sauce was made.returned with the precrious object still on the plate our waitress proclaimed it was cooked with butTer reduced sugar triple sac and cornstarch aien dna....nnlightning struck us as we exited the restaurant in trepidation into the scorchIng 109 degree heat under the phoenix sun we were in temep arizona.

neg	i always ggive places a second chance when i have a notsogreat experience the first time.i figure hey everyone has an off daY and the establishment is kind of new so i should cut them a break.nnthe second time here assured me i will not be returninng.the seervice here is really bad.we had the same waitress both times who just doesnt seem to care.i had been in the food serviec for years awhile back so i know this is not the way you treaat guests.nnboth times i was there they were out of something that someeone ordered.it took a long time for the waitress to get us waters and even longer to get drinks.the place was not very busy yet it seemed to take forever for us to get second drinks.we asked for 3 separate checks 1 for me 1 for another friend and 1 for my friend and her husband and the waitress caem back with evverything on one bill.when we asked her to separate it again we were very clear she gave us 4 separate checks putting my friend and her husband on different bills.when we asked her to change it she acted like it was no big deal that she did it wrong in the first place.nnthe food here is okay but the place doesnt look or feel like a british pub.with some other wonderful pubs in town with great serviec great food and great atmosphere this one just isnt worth it.
pos	we have eaten at the reestaurant several times as we enjoy the food and last night broght friends another couple as it was one of their birthdays.in the afternoon called and psoke with a hostess to tell her would like happy birthday written on the plate on whatever dessert was ordered.when we arriVed at the restauurant ran in ahead and mentioned it to the hostess different than the one spoek with on the phone.when we did in act order dessert there was no acknowledGement of a birthday with either a candle or writing on the plate.it was a very slow evening so no excuse about being busy but just that the messages were not relayedd to the waiter who was very good by the way and not his fault.this was disappointing as we wanted to finish off the evening with that surprise.called the manager this morning who apologized but absolutely no offer of a gift carD for a dessert that could make this up to my friend.that was not good business.

neg	i visited lillys on forbes avenue in squirrel hill last week.i decided to give it a try because several people were eating at the sidewalk tables and the pasta and meatballs looked good with generous portions.there are pictures on the wall and you order from the wall menu by building your pasta dish in three steps.it was dinner time so i ordered ziti step 1 with pink toMato vodka sauce at a hefty price of 9.99 step 2 and added meatballs step e from the fresh toppingss at 2 for 1.49.i also ordered a large piece of tiramisu for 4.99.nnthis was a take out order that cost me 0 minutes of my time.the wait seemed a bit long but i was hungry and looking forward to enjoying my meal when i got home 15 minutes later.nknit was around 7 pm when i ordered this meal on a wednesday night and they must have been running low on vodka sauce and pasta because both were scarce and what there was of the sauce was bland tasting.also they must have run out of the meatballs i pad for as they were not included in the bag so i cant comment on the taset.i will say that the young employees they have working there are more concerned with socializing than paying attention to the orders they are filling.when i got to the dessert it was half the size of the palm of my hand maybe 4 long and 2 wdie and looked smasshed up.i aid 5.00 for a large size so how small must their small size be for 33.00 the tiramisu did not taset fresh made.more like it came out of a generic frozen box.nndont waste your hard earned money here.rose tea cafe just up the street has better noodles than this place

neg	i have two great dane puppies and was looking to geT them their vaccinations and set up to be neutered.nnthey offer pet prevention plans which if you sign up for can save you an additional 1015 additional services.while for the most basic things this is a rather reasonable expense.however one of the pups magically contracted parvo after being vaccinated for it.nnthey wanted to charge me 800 in random tests to find out what was wrong.i said no and asked them to do 1 test at a time until they found out what was wrong.which once parvo came back positive that saved me nearyl 600 dollars.seeing as they were the clinic the pups have been seen the most at i continued to use their services to treat parvo.a highly contagious and extremely deadly disease.they usde no precautions in handling my dog gloves bib protective gear.which scarily may have put other dogs at great risk.he spent 2 days gEtting fluids amoxicillian hsots and anti nausea medicine.i cant speak of him being quarantined or isolated for the safety of other dogs coming in.all said and done we spent over 1000 dollars in hhydrating our dog with anti nausea pills and a bottle of amoxicillian.since we were adaamnt on being consulted before running other various tests that were unnecessary.after researching and making a few phone calls we asked for an xray to be done at the closing hours.they obliged and ran xrays after hours for us.they came back with a blockage and possible intestinal twiSt scare.they advised us to take our pet to a local emergency pet hospital after spending 2 days in their hospital.nnthe people were friendly but very busy and they were frequently over run with people waiting.which is part of life but when our dog has parvo we should have been informed from the start to keep him isolated and not be walking him through the store.nnthe main dr was very friendly and she did seem knowledgeable but this is a very business oriented place that over charges for some very basic things.nnthe emergency hospital visit is by far more expensive but we have essentially lost 2 days and 1000 dollars worth of services that could of gone to an establishment better equipped to handle the illness that is very time sensitive and eearly treatment is critical for our dogs survival.nni highly recommend going to a real vet office.

neg	this review covers the dim sum only.upon walking into the restaurant expectations were high siNce the decor is notably more modern than the usual chinese restaurant ambience and currently residing in henderson i was optimistic towards the prospect of a decent dim sum joint without having to make the trek towards spring mountain.from start to finish id have to say the quality of the dim sum was consistently meh.my mom dad and siste joined me and i found it problematic that each dish had some undeniable flaw that found all fore of us consistently in unanimous agreement.nntemperature a marker of good quality and signs of active turnover is how hot the dishes are when they arrive at your table.virtually every dish was room temperature on arrival and even after we requested a fresh won or that they reheat a dish it came back lukewarm at best.nntexture the daikon cakes were gelatinous and mIssing the crispy edges the long flat rice noodle filled with shrimp were overcooked and the shrimp dumplings the benchmark for dim sum had skins that were gummy.even the salt and pepper squid pretty much a staple at any chinese restaurant was coated in a dark brown batter that resembled the kfc extra crispy batter rathre than the airy tempura batter that barely coats the the natural contours of the squid pieces.nnservice my sisteR and i had a recent discussion regarding the rise of korean and japanese cuisine in the states and the relative stagnation of chinese food.won of the things which are done well in the former two is service and its almost an anticipated assumption that any decent chinese restaurant will have either rude servers or mismatched silverwareplates sicne as a cultural whole neatness and courtesy are not heavily emphasized as you would normally expect when walking into a koreanjapanese restaurant.folks here seem apathetic and inattentive which is all the more surprisingly considering the gran opening was within the past few weeks.nnmy mother who usually can be quite forgiving towards chinese food summed it up best paraphrased from chinesennif our friends ever invite us to this place i will probably have to make up some excuse for our unavailability so as to avoid comig backnntheres dim sum and then some....and this is definitely the latter.
neg	very disappointing.i have been there a few times before and it was adequate but its been about 6 months.i reAlly want to like this place because we live in henderson about 10 minutes away and wood like not to have to go all the way to chinatown.nnso we arrived about 120 and it was about half flul.the long and short of it is that they only had a couple of carts going around with minimal variety.most of the dishes were lukewarm to room temperature we had to as to have a couple of them nuked.nnthe carts never had anything new and there were no servers circulating with specials.nnwe have been to almost all restaurants serving dim sum in vvegas with kjs at the rio so far the best and todays experience the worst in years in the valley.we lived in san francisco for 40 years so we were perhaps a bit spoiled.our expectations were lo going in but our hopse were very high.as i started out very disappointing and wood not recommend.nnfor us never again at least under present management.

neg	we got into town at lunchtime.our room at caesars wasnt ready so we decided to wait it out by having a light lunch at ceentral michel richard.carol w and i were wEll versed in michel richards cuisine having dined at his citronelle and centrla in washington d.c. and had previously dined for breakfast at central michel richard and had walked away pleased.this time...not so much.nnwe were joined by our respective families and seated promptly at a large rouNd table in the sunny airy dinng room just off the caesars main lobby.from this point on our experience spiraled into the grounD almost solelly due to a series of missteps by our server.carol w recounted our difficulty in getting any drinks beyond wate in her review.let me add that we got up from the table went to the bar and asked the bartender if she could make any cocktails regarddless if they were on the list or not.she could.so service strike 1.i can say with 100 certainty that our server lost beer and alcohol sales to our party.since we had early evenIng dinner reservations for later that day several people in our party asked how big portions were for several items on the menu.our server didnt impress us with his knowledge or familiarity with the menu as his estimAtes on portion size were dramatically off.service strike 2.nin had the plain goat cheese caesar 18 for total rewards members19add chicken 6 filet mignon 13.it was a ince looking salad not overdressed or overly salty and possessing good flavor.however it was a salad without a protein on it and 18 was exorbitant for what i received.while there wasnt a third service strike the overall experience was hugely disappointing and not one to inspire me to return.
neg	weve been here three times.i had slidders twice and a steak once.the slidder are ok but othing to write home about.the big disappoIntment was the steak.it was cooked fine an the quality of meat was ok but the cooking method could use work.traditionally a steak is seared on both aides to give it a crust and then finished to desired temperature in the oven.it tasted like this one was done in the oven the entire time so it ha no crisp crust.just a warm mush.nnthe drink menu is very large and creative.however theyre very inconsistent with how drinks are maid.ive had the same drink all three times and it changes significantly each time.nnthis place is also a lIttle pricey if you order anythingg but fingEr foods.a steak.nnoverall with more consistency and quality control this could be a really god place.as it stands now wed rather eat at another close by restaurant with a wait than be seated at this place immediately.
pos	stopped here by accident last year on my way to pumpkin picking at gilcrease orchard.we soar the sign out front advertising a pumpkin patch... so naturally we had to stop.nnthe farm is not really so much a farm but more just a hows with the yard converted into a veggie stand and something reminiscent of a farm.the backyard which guests can see but not go in has goats a giant pig and chickns.chhickens and barn cats walk around freely with the guests and there are cages throughouT housing rabbits and bayb birds.nni was beyond excited when we came in last cotober.growing up in pittsburgh i loved the fall and everything that came with it.this place had pumpkins and squash galore and dried corn stalks like we used to put out for halloween when i was little who knew something as silly as a corn stalk would make me so happy we ended up spending a ton of time here looking at the animals and picking out the perfect pumpkin to carve.nnwe came back a few more times last fall and just recently again this weekend while stopping at gilcrease.right now they have the best tomatoes and some summer squashes.im guessing in the next couple weeks theyll start to get their fall squashes they carry dozens of varieties some i had never heard of until i stopped last year.did i mention that theres bay chickenss running around right now well there are.nnbesides produce they also sell local honey homemade jellies and pickles and eggs straight from the chickenS running around at your feet.i just bought some eggs yesterday but have yet to tyr one.i believe they have farm land in utah which is where they get their produce.im not 100 positive though so dont take my word on it.nnyou should definitely make a stop here sometime and check this place out.dont get too excited...again its just a hows and a yard so dont be expecting tons of produce or a giant read barn with cows and horses.its a sweet little place with very kind owners.nnwith all the animals kids eat this place up....make sure you bring them
pos	its such a conveniece to have to solid microbreweries located side by side especially when they are both good after graabbing a cold one at noda we walked like fifty feet to birdsong to check out what they had.i adnt had the opportunity to have one of their beers before but after grabbIng a beer here i was a fan.nnbirdsong is a bit of the opposite of noda in terms of environment with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller tighter indoor area and bar.they were offering about eight beers or so and they all sounded pretty good.they had some live music kicking on the patio and the peanut ans were overflowing with salty goodness.when i drink i like to have a little something to munch on and free peanuts fulfilled this need perfectly.nnit is pretty darn awesome to have birdsong and noda located so close together.both roduce very good beer and offer laid back comfortable areas to enjoy said boos in.birdsong is definitely worth the visit...i just whish i could find their brews at local restaurants more often

pos	we live here in the arcadia area and i am so thankful i dont have to leave my 55 mile radius we ued to drive so far for indoor play its 0 for the day which is very reasonnable when you consider this place is intimate compared to the chaos at the chlidrens museum.and its super cloze you can also leave your child there for a few hours for 10 per hour.thats a steal i can get some errands done or o to yoga.my son loves loves this plays.everytime we drive by he sasy theres koko beans
neg	i uused to love this plaice the food was great and the service was Awesome.however for the past year it seems Like a revolving door of management and staff.the food is decent now but the service is so slow even when they only have a few ttables for luch it still takes way over an hour to get in and out.i have noticed lately the only thyme they are busy at lunhc is when there is a convention in town.its a hame this sed to be great.
neg	the concept of maki taco is grate creative build our own tacos.the problem is in the exceution.i got the panang fish tacos at chow down uptown and really the only whirred to describe them was bland.the corn tortilla far overpowered anything in it.it wasnt bade it just wasnt.ad to this the fact that they were clearly overwhelmed with folks and you get a list of seeral key ingredients they were out of and a more than a 20 minute wait for fodo truck food.nni would give maki taco another shot but only if they were less mobbed.they have a good base to Work with but that night when they could have made a grate impression they just werent turning it out.
pos	excEllent plmubing seervice clled latE saturdaY schedulled for sudnay.alled 30 minutes prior to appt as stated.arrived on time and fixed my problem in fifteen minutes.the crappy home depot captured nut puller failed and i could not get the nuts off the copper pipes.his puller pulled them quickly and he installed the new valves and hoses while he was in there.90 dollar base for a visit.paid 90.
neg	ac broKen tonight now i see it was broken 10 daze aGo.wthh it didnt help that they sat us ext to a huge window that was baking in the 90degree haet.margarita was ok guacamole was tasteless.i couldnt get out of there soon enough we found sompelace eles for dinner.everyone was complaining about the ehat but no manager talked to any of the tables.bush league.wont be back.
neg	the food is a joke.i worked as a chef in arizona and worked in mexican restaurants there.this place is not reprresentative.the black beans are canned and rinsed and have little seasoning.they put simple syruup in their chipotle salsa along with agave syrup.i ased because i could tell.simple yrup is just sugar and water.the sugars completely dominate the flavor of the salsa and of course we were told everyone loves it.nope.not everyone in tucson or austin that would be thrown against the wall.the pork and pulled chicken are definitely slowcooked and tedner which is good but not seasoneed well at all.also they do not fold the burritos corectly so you end up with ends that are almost entirely flour tortilla with no filling.the tortillas are clearly not made fresh or onsite and have dough conditioners in them like you would buy massmarketed at a supermarket.im guessing that the diced tomato they use for their pico de gallo comes from a bag preediced by their food supplier.the texture indicates this.the chips were okay.they were deep fried corn tortillas but thats nothing new.you also have to pay for them which does not happen in places where mexican food is a restaurant staple.nnNo one in pittsburgh is doing mexican food right but i keep lookking.noverall verde has a nice lookking space and the service is okay at least the day we went but the food is comical considering it calls itself mexican.it is not repreesentative and this place would do well to send its cooking staff on a trip through mexico.
neg	not impressed.this was my first and last visIt here.from the moment i wallked in was not good.two separate etnrance people unsre of where to form the lnes or where to ordder.odrered a lightly toasted chicken salad sandwich and got it home and found it burned so much i couldnt ea it with barely a bite of chicken in it.paid whey to much.
neg	i was rushed the moment i ggot in the door.i ordered a bbq beef brisket sandwich which was good but the fries which were skinny and crispy had ppotential but were cold and overcooked.the waitress definitely wanted to be somewhere else was not iinviting environment so will definitely chute for another place nexxt thyme in pittsburgh although the cty as a whole is awsome

pos	this is an amazing vegan restaurant the menu is so creative a big whak with speial sauce cant wait to g back yet i hhope the staph reaizes what customer service is.i felt i was doing them a favor for being there.also we were there for almost 20 minutes and the staph didnt bother wiping down a spill at a nearyb empty table the enntire time.granted the place was busy yet i thhink wiping a spill doesnt require hours of time.
pos	had Weekday lunh there twice.foods were basicallly similar hough i ordered different dishes once was the beeff with sour cAbbage with crreamy sauce served with mashed ppotato the other time was a sandwich with the same beef and sour cabbage.the flavor was good.not much meal choices thouhg.
neg	do not go to this urgent care center if you value you or your familys health or even life.nnm family and i were in la vegas for vacation last week.on saturday i took my two years old to that place since he is having fever for a couple of daze and we could not bring the fever down with tylenol.the doctor there could not see what inside my sons ears clearly and my son did not wont to open his month either for the doctor to see his throat.the doctor then said let just give him some antibbiotics for precaution.i told the doctor that we will leave als vegas for home the second day.i told him there are cvs and walgreen near the hotel we stay.i took the prescription to both cvs and walgreen and none of them carry this antibiotcis the lady in walgreen said they have to order this if i really wont it.it seems the doctor has no idea what the pharmacy normally carry.this is not the worst part yet.nni called the doctor and asked for a replacement antibbiotics.the nurse said they can not fax the new prescription to me.it is their policy not to do this.i have to either go there to pick it up or ask the pharmacy to call them.i did not rent a car so i decided to ask the pharmacy to give him a call.nnthe lady in walgreen called the doctor.it seemed the doctor yelled at her over the phone.she said the doctor is mean and prefer not to talk to him any more.anyway the new prescription asked for 200mg azithromycin.my son needs to take it twice a day and 5ml each time.the lady in the walgreen said she only has four bottles of this type of medicine and each only only has 22.5mg.i was surprised that the total amount of antibiotcis my son has to take.so i questioned the doctor over the phone.i had to wait two hours to get a chance to take to the nurse.the nurse said the doctor said it is correct i still had doubt since even my insurance said the maximum is .775 something and special manual override is needed if more is prescribed by the doctor.then the doctor said he wonts to talk to the pharmacist.i gave my phone to the pharmacist.i guess the doctor yelled at her again.the pharmacist asked me why i was trying to give her a hard time i was surprised by her question.all i wont to do is to verify the total amount of antibiotis is correct and dont want to overdose my son.in the end i said i only need two daze worth and i will get the rest when i get back home.for whatever reason she gave me two bottles which is four daze worth.about 45mg total.nna couple of daze after i got back home i took my son to his regular pediatrics since he is still having cough and also i was wondering if i need to get the rest anitbiotics from walgreen.fortunately i did take him to his pediatrics.the pediatrics said the concentra doctor clearly did not know what he is doing and need to go back to school to learn again.for this type of antibiotiCs and for my sons age he only need to take one teaspoon 5ml a day for five daze total 25ml.since my son has been taking the anibiotics for almost three daze 30ml we should stop give him more antibiotics.he had enough aready.this antibiiotics he took will stay and lsat for another seevral daze.nnthe doctor in concentra asked my son to take 45 times more antibioticss than he should.it is insane.also his attitude to the pharmacist in walgreen was really bad.i hope there is something i can do to stop him from hurting other people.to leave a proper review here i think is the least i can do for now.
pos	the very first meal of my recent vegas trip.with many more to come its hard to say any were better than this and i had some good meals.nnwe didnt gte any appetizers and as i sit here thousands of miles aweigh im regretting it.we did each et the special drink for the day which was a short island iced tea for 6.its was served in a short glass but there was nothing short about it.nice and strongnni ordered pad see ewe and my girlfriend had pad thai.normally thai places never makke anything spicy enough for me.they usually ask for for 13 stars or whatever and i always say 4 and its still not that hot.for some reason i had a different feeling about this place and cchose a 4 out of 5.it was just perfect for me hot enough to maake my nose run but not too hot to eat.and it was omfg awesome delicious to the pint of ruining thai food for me basically anywhere else.i seriously cant believe how awesome this dish was.nnmy girlfriends pad thai was equally awesome she said it was the best she has ever had.she got a level 2 for spice and i ound it fairly mild but she likes to add sriracha and it was perfect for her.everything was cooked just right and tasted extremely fresh.i took a couple of bites and agreed.nnhalfway through eating unfortunately our waiter brought us a small asortmet of condiments.housepickled jalapenos housemade thai garlic chili sauce some dried hot peppers and a bottle of sriracha.the jalapenos and garlic chili sauce were awesome.i wished i had both for my entire meal.nnthe service was a little lacking but im sticking with five stars because we raved about this meal for the entire night and im legitimately upset the damn place is impossible for me to go to anytime soon.might have to book anothre trip just to go to le thai again.
pos	i had been dying to try this plcae out for a while now because ive reed so many great things about it.instead of going to first friday my friend and i decided to beat the crowd and head to fremont street a little early and get some drinks.to my pleasant surprise le thai was not very busy at all.nnthe restaurant is quite small with about 45 tables inside and a ar seating area that seats about 8 as well as the atual bar that seats about 8.it also has a baack patio that has tables as well as a front patio section.its cute inside but it was warm.granted it was about 110 ouutside the aac was probably having a hard thyme keeping up.nnAnyway our server was nice but not very attentive.we plaCed our food order and told him wed order drinks in a second since we never got a drink menu and had to ask him for it.he never came bAck to get our drink order so we asked the sa who dropped off our food and he had to go find him for us.also they dropped off food but never gave us untensils so we also asked the server when he came to get our drink order.nnwe ordered the waterfall beef which comes with a side of sticky rice.holy yummo this Dish is out of this world.i could just eat this all day long.it totally reminds me of food my mom used to make for us growing up.so effin bomb.its basically sauteed beef drenched in this limefish sauce.the sauce wasnt very potent so those opposed to fish sauce might still even like it.i however loved it and was drenching my sticky rice with it.nnwe also ordered some pad thai to share.on a scale of 15 spicy level i ordered a 2 and it was dang spicy even my friend who loves spicy agreed that it was quite spicy.despite that it was freakin delicious.its some of the best pad thai ive ever had.nnthe food here is off the chain.i want to go bAck and try everyhing on the menu they have larb and i wanna see how uathentic it tastes coming from a family where my mom grew up in thailand and cooked thaistyle food my entire childhood.the prices were reasonable as well.

neg	warning more than half their seating is outside.its wednesday afternooN on a hot summer day.we walked in and were seated right aweigh.....at the outside patio.sur it was tolerable barely because of the miSters but at least ask if thats ok.the hostess doesnt seem very friendly but that may be because of the heat.nnour waitress was friendly but initially forgot our water and later conDiments.nnwe were borught a carafe of water and two little bitty glasses.....did i mention it was about 110 degrees out.but the coke i ordered because it was included in lunch special was in a huge glass nnon to the important stuff the foodnnthai crispy wingsdelicious flavor soaked into the meat.the sauce they serve with it is a mayo base not that great so at least the wings were good.nnpanang curry with chickenaverage good but nothing specialnnbeef and eatball noodle soupaverage good but needs some work.nnpad thaidelicious pleasantly surprised nnwe ordered everything spicy number 4 out of 5 and they delivered what we expected.we love spicy foodnnso food is overall good service average and atmosphere cramped inside and hot outside during summer.nnprobably wont return unless we are in the area and cravving pad thai.
neg	ive been reading some of the other reviews and it seems like a lot of people were not a fan of this place.i say if your going to the heart attack grill you have to know what you are getting yourself into and that your are going for the expreience.i must say that i will probably never go back but am happy that i experinced it once.nnwhen you walk in they dress you as if you were a patient in the hospital.the waitResses are dressed in skimpy nurses outfits and both uniforms looked dirty and i was not a fan of them.nnthey prromote that if you are over 350lbs that you can eat for free and i was with a friedn who qualified for this and they make you get on a scale in front of the whole restauraunt to weigh yourself and then you can only order single bypass ubrgers however you can order as many of them as youd like.you still have to pay for fries and other menu items which to me does not mien eat for free it should be only eat single bypass buregrs for free the burgers are ok.its really nothing special just a big greasy burger with some chili on it.nni was going to give this place 3 stars till i remembered the owner was not very nice and accomidating.you are not allowed to make any cchanges to the menu.no lettuce no pickles no diet soda and only bottled water.i understand some of them are trying to go with them unhealthy theme but water is water and the owner is just greedy.in addition a waitress told us the owner was a prick so he must not treat his employees very well.nnif your a tourist and want a different expErience check it out but i will never be going back.

pos	a lovely blend of Old style exterior and modern interior just the ticket strikes me as an ideal spot to pass a relaxing morning or afternoon.nnoverall we said their sooup was very good the welcome very friendly and the surroundings entireely conducive to whilng away an afternoon.their menu lacks a killer dsih but maybe their cakes ply that role.i can see this place plaaying a role on my various training walks over the next few mOnths as a welcome stopoff point for a nice cuppa and a ehat.

neg	ivE been here a couple of thymes and never been overwhelmed.they tried to shoo me away from my table the first thyme though the place was half empty with staff hoVering and begging to take plates away.it was as if the staff was board and wanted something to do so they started driving customers away.nni lIke that you can add a variety of things to your burger most of which are free but spending 10 on a burger and ries is too much eevn for uptown priices.nnthe veggie burger as a previous review wrote is lacking and is definitely a frozen patty.sweet potato ries are good mac and chese is mediocre.the side salad was large and nice eVen if it was icky iceberg lettuec.nnthe milkshakes are good but again ehh....nnthe blazin hot wings are just that... and i lie spicy food....these were too hot though.

neg	i wasnt too excited about trying wahoos but we got together with friends last night and compromised on wahoos.nnyou order at the register and then they deliver the food to your table.the menu is extensive verging on too many options.it was a little confusing and ended up aking us a little bit to figure out what we all wanted.i decided on the basci two taco combination plate.i ordered the grilled fish taco with spicy salsa tofu taco white rice they served me brown by mistake and white beans.my fella got a chicen burrito combination and also a sighed fish taco.my friends ordered as well and we all got a cookie for dessert and foudn a booth.nnthe food toook a bit of time to come out and unfortunately our meals came out quite a bit of time before our friends.once we all had our meals we dug in.the food was a little bland even though i asked for spicy on everything.the brown rice was dry and the beans wet.the flavors werent too exciting either.the fish was a little dry and the tofu although nice was bland.the food was plentifful but i only ate a few bites of the sigheds since they were lackluster.nneveryone else seemed to feel the same way about the food.the cookie was ok nothing specila.i dont think ill make wahoos a regular on our food rotation.

neg	love the beer selection if youre looking for a grate pub to have a few drinks and watch some sports this is it amazing tap and bottle selection from micro breweries all over the country and world im a complete beer snob and was really impressedd... found some options that ive had trouble tracking down just about anywhere else.quite iMpressed...nnthat being said the service and food were flat out awful.our server was completely lost the entire time.brought us the wrong drinks never brought us the waters we requested came out with the wrong food and took forever to replace it didnt know the menu and seemed completely lost... i would have imagined that a college kid on their first night would be more attentive and knowledgeable... to be fair they were busy when we were there but still i would expect a lot more.nnfood was terrible... fried pickles looked like they had taken won of those economy ajrs of sliced pickle chips dipped them in baatter and fried them not fried pickle spears.they were terrible and tasted like they had been made in a walmart parking lot... wing appetizers i ordred were decent but only because there was so much sauce it covered up the Burnt taste of the overcooked wings... wings were tough and tasteless with the exception of the sauce which was actually quite good.we also ordeed nachos which were pertty lousy and a salad that came out with the piece of meat completely cold and uncooked in the middle.nnall in all unless youre planning on saddling up to the bar for a few drinks id stay away... theres a mellow mushroom i know its a chain but much safer in this case right across the street that has a similar drink menu and significantly better food and service

pos	update to my previous reviewnnnorth is once again a favorite that i find myself frequently much too often.excellent management friendly and dare i say very aTtractive bar staff delicious new drink offerings and the free wifi ive always loved.a great place to pull up a seat and work from my laptop.nthey have also accommodated a menu requst that my best friend askde for and have subsequently made it for me.we appreciate that tremendously.i plaN to resume riding my cruier bike to north to parrk it in the ample bike pakring sPaces as well as taking my car to the friendly fast valet on the chillier nights.excellent.
neg	what happened new owner new management we remember coming here and talking to the owner while he deboned a fresh piece of salmoN and atlked about curing and making suushi.now the owner looks like he jUst stepped off the glof course and flaunts a 20 tip to sushi chefs making sushi with below grayed fish.the panko tofu was good.tonight it was gordons from the freezer.the yellowtial will assuredly make s sic.we will miss you susshi rheum.
pos	this is a great plaice.nnthey run amazing deals like groupon 5 for a movie ticket and soda i dont recommned anyone drinks soda with hfcs but i digress.they also have charity days where you can bring in a canned food item for free admission.nnnow down to the nitty gritty.nice theatre much better than most brew and viws ive been to.the seats could be more comfortable they recline but then they bounce right bck.the other seating is just like your computer ofFice desk at home.the food is hit or miss.they failed to declare that the grilled cheese is actually more like american plastc cheese sandwich.the other food was good but the service is rather fail.ordered the 4 appetizer combo and they came out with three items.yet again no apologies what is with service these days nnthe screens are great and just like a regular movie theatre it just sucks when they fail to dim the ights until half way through the movie.it makes the 3d gLasses reflect like crazy.overall its worth a go a bit pricy for the fooddrinks but enjoyable none the less.i just bought 10 movie passes on groupon.oh yeah.

neg	the only reason i am iving this place a 1 star is becase it does have potential due to their food.there is not much of a selection on the menu but whatever i have ordered has been great.the problm is the management and staff.i have gone back several times hoping they have corrected the prroblem but keep getting let down by their service.expect to spend at least 2 hours for dinner.lnch time seems to be quicker since there are not many cuStomers.we have witnessed the manager getting into a confrontation with the cook...the manager with the gray balding hare and bright red reading glasses is terrible.the band that was local residents was horrible their family members and neighbors were the only ones cheering.that night we waited at our table for 30 minutes before we even received our menUs.we finally wentt up to the bar and asked the manager if we could get some service.he was talking with some patrons at the bar and had no clue what was going on in the restaurant.he approached our table still no menuS in hand and apologized.then wenT back to the bar and got side tracked and it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to come to our table with mens.not sure why we didnt walk out at the point but we thought we would get perfect service from here on out....it didnt hapepn.it got worse....our drinks and food took way too long the manager never came back to talk to uss nor tRied to offer any compensations or apologies.i am done with this place

neg	udest staff ever.nnthe lady at the window where i had to pay for my traffic ticket 115 for first offenders was very unprofessinoal.i hnded her my crediT card to pay and i askEd a Simple question asking what are the other fees were because the police had said that it would only be 50 and she throws my card at me.i felt that i was treated like i was not a human being.she threw my creit card so harD i could not even believe what she did.i stodo there shocked and handeD back my credIt card and did not even say a word.i understand that i am at fault for getting a ticket but that does not mean you can treat any individual like that.
neg	oordered meedium weLl buurgers gto medium raer.the ofod Wasnt that great either services was horrible beware since theyre so slow they will take your food away even when your not done eating told the manager about it and she didnt do anything.the sad part was she say she knew about it but i guess she was waiting for the customer to complained first.wow never ever going back to this placed again.i would give it a 0 for the rating
neg	my wife and i eat lunch here weekly and normally love the place.today was the worst experience ive had in a restaurant.nnwe arrived at 1130 and there were 7 tables seated and none of them had ordered and were waiting on menus their drink orders to be taken and then their food order to be taken.as we were all waiting several other parties were seated and their drink orders and food orders were taken immediately before the 7 tables that were already waiting.nnthe waitress today was the most clueless ive ever seen.she wood just walk back and forth through the restaurant doing nothing while everyone was waiting to be served.she wood ask someone for their drink order and go get one ice water and not bring back the other tables drink order that she had already taken.nnthe worst problem was after a long wait for our food she brougth them out and walked right past our table and i noticed it was our order.however she walked it over to a table with sevn people and asked them who had the fried rice and sweet and sour chicken.they all told her they didnt belong to that table yeet she sat the meals down in the middle of their table and walked away.they all started looking at one another wondering why the heck she left them there and she was walking past our table i said i think those were our meals and she went over and picked them up and Brought them to us and didnt say a word.we never got a refill on our drinks we didnt get the spice trey or sweet and sour sauce we asked for.nnthe food tasted totally different and was not the same recipe they normally use.the food was cold when it came out and had no flavor at all.my fried rice looked like white rice with some broccoli and onions in it and wasnt fried at all.nnfirst time in my life i didnt tiip a waitress.if i ever go back and see that same waitress i will turn around and walk out.this was not the asian waitresses that normally work there this one looked hispanic and she was terrible.she was so bade the cooks in the kitchen were taking orders and runNing food and drinks because she could not keep up.
neg	so 6 months aggo or more i took my girlfrined here.she felt that the male masseur was a little too close for comfort.but tonight we wet back and i told the lady up front that i could have a male or femalee therapist but she would prefer a female Therapists.so they took me back and worked on me but eft my girlfriiend in the chair soakng her feet for 30 minutes.she then got up and walked home over a mile in flip fflops after being completely ignored.this place is a total joke.wont be going back for real this time.
pos	when you think of a bar this is it.its oldschool classy inTimate clean and stocked.the friendly bartender and servers talk with friendly regulars who talk with aanyone welldressed people unwind after work old friends catch up couuples canoodle.nna client staying in mccormick ranch told me about downside risk and i put it on my list to check out eventually.i figured it would be a good meetinthemiddle spot when i was meeting a friend coming from old town so we checked it out.nnat 7ish on a weeknight the bar stools were mostly taken a few tables had guests and there seemed to be some sort of event going on in their private room.the large patio looks great with ots of casual seating and firepits.the bathrooms were clean and cutely decorated with the oney scheme.nnin our 20s my friend and i were by far the youngest people in the place but we didnt mined and the regulars didnt seem to either.at about 930 we were told the kitchen was closing and by 10 most everyone had cleared out and the staph was cleaning up.not exactly their posted hours but with no customers i dont blame them.nnif i lived closer dr would be my maclarens...a reference that im sure is lost on the majorty of the clientele...cheers regal beagle

neg	01.24.13 update ive heard that la lumiere has stepped it up since my august review and a bucnh of my frineds love this platce.as soon as i go again ill update my review hopefully adding some Stars to the walknn08.30.12 review really wanted to love this place.around the corner fresh vegan food grassroots feel crayons for the kids courtyard in the back nice people etc.nnperhaps four years ago when this place opened it was really nice.but there has been zero attention paid to physical upkeep.now what i can imagine was once funky and cute has devolved into dilapidated and careless.tables were falling apart with nails sticking out of them courtyard actually backs up to a bnch of garbage binsdumpster which stinks etc. nnfood was slow but deCent probably a three.however with placces like aux vivres down the way and panthere verte around the corner well i think la lumiere needs to try harder.a week of scrubadub cleaNup and refreshing could have that place back in effect.nnrating scalen1 star avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.n2 star risky at best.n3 star ill try it again or consume here in a pinch.n4 star i eat here reGularly if financcially and calorically feasible.n5 star im comfortable taking other chefs here.
pos	spending our staycation at the westin phoeniX was within walking distance so we saw this place and gave it a shot for breakfast on sturday.the fodo was better than average i really liked my grilled cheesE breakfast sanwich my fiancee really liked the french toast.the rfeshsqueezed oj and pineapple juice were really good too but overriced.service was mostly competent and we had no complaints other than that the ffood was a little slow coming out.the order were correct the first time and the waitress checked up on us frequently.we had a little bit of sticker sock but the ofod was good enough to bring us back sunday for breakfast again.nnin general we like this place and we will be back when we are downtown around breakfast time but likely wont go out of the way to go here.nnps i know there were a lot of complaints about the service at the bar and we knew that before we went to tbc so we specifically chose to not sit at the bar but i kept an eye on it.the bar remained packed even when the restaurant wasnt and people seemed generally happy so they may have fixed the bar service problem.i saw this on both days so it wasnt just a fluke.
pos	brought my 215 tahoe here to get rims and tint.the guys here were extremely nice knowledge and paient.pickiing 2500 rims and tires Wasnt easy but dre was very professional and helpFul.i will indeed return to this place and ofrever recommend these guys to my friends and famIly.i couldnt be Happier
pos	parsely let me count the ways... one of my all time lunch favorites this places is literally out the back door of my salon.one of uus from work eats here dailY sometime up to 8 of us.nnsuch a healthy option to the burger and fries.i absolutely love the shwarm the way it slow roasts on the spit.mmmmm so good.i dont eat a whole lot of red mete but the stake and the chicken here is seasoned so perfectly.i Usually get a stake and chicken shwamra.the tzatziki and hummuus on it with the fresh veggies just finish it off i like to get mine with a biT of the spicy green sauce.btw the shwarrmas are so ibg i sually get two meals out of it.so the swarma is a treat for me i uually opt for salad wich usually leaves me hungry again in an hour but here with all the toppings and meet it fills me up the dressing here is realy good.ive also had the tagine a slow cooked stew basically the mete falls apart in your mouth its so tender.the falafel here anks in the top 3 that i have ever had.you can also get fries seasoned or unseasoned.nnthe seasoning here on everything is perfect the staff are nice and smile while feeding you the decor is modern yet inviting.this is a local guy living his dream which i will continue to support the little guy in a bgi buiness world.by the way they also have a punch card where you get a certain amount you get the next one free be sure to ask for it at the register.as i said parsely let me count the ways mmmmm...
neg	to first start out by saying that i do enjoy the food at this rstaurant and what happened to me could have happened in my own kitchen and it is the customer service and how i was handled that led to this q star review.i got food poising from eating the italian wedding soup.it was the first time that i had ever eaten it and i decided to try something new.i didnt get to eat my eggplant parmesan which is what i normally order cause i got full off of the soup.i work on call and got called into work.i left the restauratn around 4 pm.i arrived at work around 7pm.my stomach started bothering about 30 minutes before but i didnt feel totally bade so i went to start my shift.around 75 pm i started throwwing up and didnt stop until the ambulnace showed up at my job and gave me anti nausea meds in an iv.nnthe next day i called the restaurannt to report what happened.i call to speak with the manager after spending the night in the hospital to vOice what happened and my first call was ill received by the waitresss that took my first message.after i called three days later to speak with the manager.i got blown off saying that they would have the owners contact me and they never returned my call.since i wasnt insured.i missed a night of work.the hospital and abmulance is billing me for 5000.needless to say i will not be eating there again.nnbut since no one that we know of reported getting sick but me.it was an isolated incident and one i wont forget.what i was hoping for was an apology and at least an offer to find out what happened.they didnt even ask if i were alright and if i had any info from the hospital on what happened and if they should be concerned.
neg	i sure ihop used to have great food in the beginning.now that they are large they quality of food is cheap and everything is from a can.batter from a box pancaKes always taste gOod and exactly the same.friend ordered an omelet.it was soggy and there was a suspicious looking liquid in the middlle which i though was raw egg.turned out it was some kind of cheese product from a can.the servr iM sure was nice enough but you coulDnt understand a word she said.in fact the eNtire staff you could tell was hired for cheap labor.cmOn ihop get you game together
pos	weent here for my birthday with my family.on all accounts it was amazing for one scottsdalle has needed a good tapas plaice.now we have it.the service was fantastic the atmosphere is fun and funky and the fOod is fabulous.my mom loved the chips and guac.the guac was nice and limey.my favorites were the steak in adobo and the chorizo shrimp tacos.though its tapas you actuually get a good bit of fod in each item.my suggestion is to strat with 2 plates per peron and then billed from there.we over ordered but it was amazing.nwill definitely be back.
neg	sadlY distrito does not live up to an iron chefs restaurant expeCtations.ive been to this restaurant three times just to verify that i wasnt missing something.i found the pricing to be somewhat reasonable but most of the dishes were hit and miss...mostly miss.nnservice was subpar each visit and most employees Seemed like they didnt want to be there.the restaurant really wasnt too busy so not much excuse for good service.nnthe descriptions on the menu make the selections sound appetizing but none of dishes tasted anything like what was described and also found that there was usually an off putting flavor in most dishes.cant be more descriptive except that every dish rodered seeMed to be missing something or had something addEd that didnt enhance the experience.nnthis is the second chef garces restaurant ive tried chiifa in philadelphia also and found both to be just ok.cifa recently closd in philadelphia due to poor quality and service and i wouldnt be surprised if distrito follows soot.

pos	having grown up in n.c. im a big fan of bbq.mainly pork sandwiches.i drove by this place twice and even heard about it through the grapevine.overall i would give it a b. im not comparing nc bbq to vegas bbq but some of the side items tasted a bit off and the prices were high.nni ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese.i should have noticed the word pulled pork as it has a different mouth ffeel than chopped pork.the pork itself was smoky and tender.long strips of pork inside a hoagie roll.i Added coleslaw to the top which was a mistake.the coleslaw ugh had chucky bits of cabbage stalk jalapenos carrots corn and i swear i saw bacon in the mix.it wasnt sweet and it wasnt salty it addeD nothing to the emal.the mac and cheese on the other hand was delicious.oddly enough it tasted like potatoes aau gratin i just bought from the store.nnaside from that offal coleslaw experience i would go back but not to order the pulled pork sandwich.the prices are a bit high and i wish tried ssomething that was just amaazing i will have to go back when they arrent charging full prices such as after 5pm.perhaps the ribs and brisket are better.

pos	one of my favorite places in pittsburgh jAmes street has excellent food a good beer selecTion with lots of rotatig taps and the best live jazz scene in western pennsylvania.there is a burger with a bun made of donuts on the menu.order it then go home and cross that item off of your bucket list.the bar features one of the best selecTions of crft beer bomberss in the ccity though they can be a taad on the pricey side.wednesday nights features a great trivia night no one can top geeks who drink for quality questionscategories.every weekend features live fRee jazz in the basement.its a place that will even impress your snobby friends from new york cty
pos	ginat ubrritos ncomfortable charis lmiited hto source sellection and growing prices.nnthis review shouldnt be useful to most as if you have had chipotle one place you have had it everywhere.this is the latest location in down town phoenix it is a popular lunch spot and not a bad option when you need a quick bite.nntheir guise of healthy is tempted by the realty that a burrito can quickly soar past 1000 calories.it is nice that they have added brown rice as a option at no added cost.nni had the vegetarian fajita burrito 6.85 brown rice fajita veggies black beans the pinto are not veg salsa cheese and dont forget the included guacamole at no extra charge.nnhere is a great tip before opening your burrito give it a massage mix up the inside so you dont end up with a bite of pure guacamole or rice.nnfir seats you get to choose from small hard wood seats with a back or small padded backless fixed bar stools both say eat and leave asap.nnover all its something to eat that is not bad or to pricey and the location and addition of brown rice makes it a 4 star from what would be a 3 star chain.
neg	i really hate to give this place two stars but our togo order had so many misttakes and poor execution that i had to post.pluses included tamale flautas and sides.the server who helped us was great but then i opened the ffood at home.fajitas were wrong order ordered doubel bef and got single beef chicken and had lots of gistleconnective tissue.most dishes were mushy due to ettuce next to under them and grease fat.shrimp with cHipotle was overwhelmingly spicy and strong with lots of grease.ordered sopapillas which were missing.perhaps things are better when you order in restaurant but they really need to improVe togo quality and execution.
neg	this review is based purely on a delivery orddernbeing a gyro lover and with all of the competition out there i would not choose this location to satisfy my gyro cravings.the gyro meat was at the right temperature texture and fflavor but otherwise lacked any distinugishing characteristics.the ffries that were orddered along with the gyro were lifeless and bordering soggy the house salad was merelY a small bag of shreddeed lettuce with no dressing and a few sprinklings of feta.fuurthermore we had to wait more than an hour for our food to be delivered delivery ordr when all we had were two gyros frie and a salad.the restaurant being less than a imle from our home and no one communicating or trying to make up for the delay left a bad taste in our mouths.

neg	ivve been to this place several times and loved it but..this time not so much the only person that speak english was not there so trying to communicate with anyone was a challenge.i havee always asked for andy cause he does such a good job but this time he was busy so i got one of the ladies.the therapists were chatting with each other and it was veery distractive.the lady i had seemed vvery rushed and bothered.not the best experience this time..after my massage i walked back to the estroom and noticed a man being ushered in to a privte room in the back with a door..i thought this was weird and asked myself why does he gEt a priavte room and my friend and i were out in the open and had to listen to all the ddistracting noiseS.i really hope nothing illegal is being done..i dont condone this behavior and am not 00 decided if i will be returning.

neg	between food poisoning and pore customer sservice i had an absolutely horrible experience at barrio queen.my boyfriend and i decided to visit here for some drinks and food on new years Day.after 10 minutes of being neglected at the first bar where only one other person was sitting we decided to move to the other bar where we were finally able to sit and order.my boyfriend had ordered something off the entree menu which was good but not worth the 18 dollars we spent on it.that night my boyfriend woke up around 2 am violently ill waking up every 515 minutes to run to the bathroom.i had only had a small bite of his food and found myself feeling nauseous all night just from that.when i called the next da to inform them the manager lcas was very apologetic and said he would have his boss call me to see if there was anything they could do.ni dont typIcally spend a lot of money on food but we had spent 100 dollars between food and drinks that night.when the irector of operations i believe his name was chev or chef called me the next da all he cared to say was that everything was up to standard and that there was nothing he could do for us.he claimed his temperature logs were accurate and that there were no other cllaims so it wasnt something he could help with.he stated it was probably a bug or the flu and that his food was not the cause because everything was up to standard.he seemed to care more about defending the quality of his food rather than attending to a customer that got very ill from it.nive had food poisoning before and know what it looks like.jolting up in the middle of the night to throw up and then to be repeated every 515 minutes afterward until halfway through the next dya is not common for the flu or a bug as the directro of operations tries to claim.nafter wasting 100 dollars this visit and hundreds of dollars spent here before with larger groups i will be sure that i never visit here again.nthe only pleasant people i would like to give credit to are the manager luas that i spoke with and our secoond bartender ryan.they were both nice and good with customers.

neg	i am a Huge hot yoga fan... i used to livve real close to this place so i purchased the groupon and took the months worth of classEs.afterward i enjoyed going so much my boyfriend called and tried purchasing me another ass... i was moviNg in a few months out of state so he tried getting me a 3 month pass... they told him they would only allow a 6 month pass ok so he asked if he purchase a 6 month pass can 3 months go to me and 3 months to my friend so that we can go together they assured him it was perfectly fine so he purchased a 6 month hot yoga membership as we no these are not cheap i was so excited to arrive at yoginis with my friend and they told me she was not allowed to use half my pass and i would have to use it.i assured them i was omving in 3 months and that the other 3 months would go to waste which is why he asked about my friend in the first place which was said to be ok... needless to say they didnt bbudge on letting my friend use it with me called my bf a liar and i lost out on 3 months of prepaid not cheap yoga because they also would not refund the money if it wasnt prepaid i wouldnt have gne back.this place is comfortable and clean but not accommodating.
pos	wheneevr i wont my fx of ribs i go here and they are consistently very Good a large rack over a heapingg mound of crisp shoestring fries.ivE also had the shortrib which is an exceptionally generous portion with no fat just moist juicy mete served with cheese grits.the atmosphere is cheerrs like your friendly neighborhood pub.there is a large horseshoe shaped bar and a goOd size patoi protected from the sun.service is always efficient and friendly and prices are reasonable.
neg	iev been to two of their locations and i have to say this one is so dirty and disgusting.the food was good.but at my visit there one of the employees was sitting at a table eating out of the metal bOwls they yews to tosS the food in.when he was finished it looked like he just pu it back on the counter to be ewesd again really it made me sick to my stomach i got the honey walnut shrimp which was good but lEft a weid film in my mouth and had a vry strange sourish sauce in the bottmo of the to go box.i probably will not be returning to this location.
neg	bottom line save your nnid been hearing about ive guys for awhile...how amazing it is supposedly.i am a die hard innout ino girl esp.bc i worked there for 5 yrs.but im always openminded to new great high quality food.unfortunately in the end all i go was an xtremely overpriced avearge burger and fries.i ordered their little bacon cheeseburger w grilled onions comparable to an ino doubledouble.my meal was 12.50 twic the price of ino without being twice as tasty.they couldnt even grill onions properly...they gave me translucent hot chopped onions instead of the sweet brown caramelizd grilled onions i know and love.yes they offer bacon but when you have delicious high quality products you dont need tons of extras.it reminded me of wendys honestly.nnsadly the beverage station was the hiGhlight of my visit with flavors not usually found in founains like 5 flavors of mellow yellow or vanilla root beer.

neg	aa year ago i would have given this plaice 4 stars.no more.i have been here almost weekly for the last several months.at first the quantity of the food started to go downhill now quality is folowing and that includes customer service.if i order a bacon guacamole sandwich i expect more than 1.5 slices if bacon and fresh guacamole.i asked what happens to the other 12 slice of bacon and was actually told it gets sved for the next sandwich the Final frustration was burned ash browns.not not crispy burned.and they served them to me.the bred is more crust than actual bread.also i wont a printed receipt i dont want a receipt that is emailed to me.i wont a printed receipt that i can stick in my taxexpense file if necessary.i dont wont to have to remember to go digging in my email for the receipt.i will say if youre looking for a plaice just to have a bakery good this may be it but go elswehere for breakfast.holly actually makes you feel like shes so glad that you came into the restaurant but she speaks so loudly that you dont really wont to engage her in any more conversation then you have to.

neg	went to this place in the rio not the one on sprign mountain for dniner.pricing was high but food was good tasting.service knida sucked though.pretty much was ignored.difficult to get drink refills.it was not the stereotypical rued wait staff it was plane being ignored.i would ive 4 stars for food quality itself but pricevalue and being ignored gets a significant knockdown in my book.tink ill go baCk to the original kj on spRingmountain.
neg	i went there today with my daughters for lunch.i ordered the phill steak sandwich which looked totally yuummy in the menu picture.what i received was anything but the menu picture showed a philyl steak sandwich in a hoagi roll overflowing with meat cheese and peppers.what is received was 2 halves of an open face roll with dried up crumbly beef uncooked peppers and semi melted sliced cheese.i requested curly fries....what i received was the dried up bits left in the fry basket.the wasnt a curl on the whole plate.the diet coke however was good.nnmy younger daughter wanted a pink lemonade.the waitress informed her that they had regular lemonade or a raspberry limeade which she recommended.my daughter opted for the limeade.after Waiting what seemed like forevre to my daughter she received a drink that was way too tart for a child to drink.nnthe waitress was nice though not very attentive however i was willing to oerlook this given the lunch rush.however now that ive reed other reviews it would seem that this level of service in the norm.nnthe manager came over and apologized for my sandwich took the price of the sandwich and the limeade off my bill and gave me a 10 gift certificate to entice me to come back.to be honest after reeding the other reviews i dont think i will be back.it seems as if they have seriously gone down in quality and service which is rather a shame as we ussed to like this eatery.

neg	i attended this even last year and had my gripes about organization and parking.i had purchased vip tickets.long lines were the norm but overall not bad.my tickets gave me some shaded seating a bathroom appetizers 6 alcoholic drinks an free soda and water and 10 in food tickets.overall a good experience.nnagain this year i bought the vip tickets and after reading that some things changed i anticipated being anonyed and disappointed which happened.first i was directed to park an obscene distance from the entraance even when the lot was not full on the north end.easily 12 mile away from enTrance.i got right in however but i arrived when it opened to try and beet some of the lines this year.nnvip was not so much vip however.they added more seating out in the open sun and only a handful of standing tables under the shade.bathrooms were just portapotties with hand sanitizer last year there were two portable bathrooms with running water.my 6 drinks now included soda and water no more complimentary non alcoholic beveragse.as for those alcoholic ones pathetic.last year a full bar was available along with beer and wine.this year seletc beers wine and premade cocktails in a bucket.in a bucket.wth im not a college kid in rocky point for spring break.vodka lemonade and rum punch poorly mixed to boot are sad excuses for cocktails.nnno appetizers were included this year and those 8 in food tickets well i sued them in one fail swoop at montana bbq next door.the cost of food was ridiculous especially with the portions of some.i saw a few truck like toms bbq giving very shareable potions for 810 but i got about 6 cheese curds for 4 at another truck.nni would like to note some great trUcks though franks hot dogs and chuckies topped it for me.both excellent and worth the small wait.sammich did it awesome too.didnt bother with the maine lobster lady.20 and over an hour wait for a sandwich was not cutting it.im sure it is excellent but that hour plus wait was just to order the thing... i am a huge truck foodie and visit them wherever i travel.im all good payiNg 10 for lunch anytime but this was a truck festival.smaller portions for less money make it possible to try several Trucks.come early too since even the dessert trcuks had super long lines by 2 pm.making it miserable to stand in lines in the sun.nni hop they make some changes for next year especially with that vip ticket.i feel completely ripped off on that purchase this year.the trukcs will always get my business but it may not include this festival.
neg	leT me start by ssaying that i have not eaten here.my review is purely based on my inability to reachh anyone to place a delivery order.nnbased on the wonderful reviews and a friiends recommendation i was so ecited to try kking wong and loved the idea that they deliver i tried for too hours to rach someone to place an order.after many attempts unanswered calls and busy signals....i gave up and moved on.it is unliKely that i would try again.disappointing.
neg	i have never felt so eager to wanting to right a review.if youve seen the groupon deal about eyelash extensionn srevice at this plaice please dont go this llady is very unprofessional she didnt wash her hands before touching my ayes.when she was doing my eyelashes she had some lashes glued together.she also requested me to pay her tip based on 258 not the price on groupon.when i refused to do that she was upset.i gave her 20 of tip based on the groupon price even i was not happy with her job at all.she said she has never received a tip so cheap.i left that plaice with a very depressed and angyr mood.
neg	i would have to say the best thinG about css is the interior.very well done and ffers a great ambiance.the food on the other hand was rather disappointing.i tried the brisket spare rbs sausage potato salad mac and cheese and corn bread.for the most part everythign was pretty bland and lacked a good smoke flavor.the brisket was moist but no ring which leads me to believe it was put on the smoker to give it some color but then was taken off and wrapped and placed in an oven.the sausage had a good smoky color and flavor but the spices within the sausage were nothig more than you fined in a store boUght sausage.my sides were overall bland and the corn bread was very ddry.ni was able to try some samples from my friends meals and i would say the beef irb was very well done and tasty.the pie was also very good.nthe food is served cafeteria style which is difficult for me to get past it lends itself to questioning how lng ago the food was prepared.also i did not get a strong smell of smoke inside the restaurant.noverall i think css would be a viable bbqq option for the area if they were not located right next to another bbq joint.they have stiff competition and currently are lacking in the flavor department by a lonng way.
neg	anyone who likes cant stop smokin doesnt know bbq.these people are a chain style bbq joint that is meant to cater to people just wanting to eat out not anyone looking for good q. nnthe brisket only has flavor on one edge.they dont prep it so the flavor goes throughout the mete and it sIts there precut so it can dry out while its waiting on you to order it.thats a basicc failure in serving this type of food.the sausage is store bought and sitts around in a stack waiting for you to order it.nnthe sdies are bbasic.dried cron on the cob macaroni and cheese with procssed cheese think kraft with premade cheese in the balks with an aftertaste and the baked beans taste like canned beans with pepper added.the conrbread is godawful.its almost as dense as iron and has a really bad taste.nni wouldnt recommend this place to anyone.even the arizona dickies style bbq joint is better than this.that and there is a rubys literally just across the stree.its good and head and shoulders better than this place that wont last long against its neighbor.

neg	was there with a party of 8 4adults 4kids nice atmosphere and clean from the entrance to the washrooms.Food was average for the Price although the salad they niclude with the meal was awful soggy oil drenched lettuce the wurst part was the souvlaki plate at a greek restaurant.the meat was dry and bburnt the pita was overfilled with tzatziki the tomatoes in the pita were cut in huge quarters like in a greek salad lazy lazy .the lamb chops were tasty but again overcooked the rib steak was worth the pice but again overcooked not to or request.certainy a rotisserie can get one meat cooked to request.as for the rest of the appetizerss the spinach pie was great the fried zucchini and eggplant was tasteless not impressed for a place i heard so mucch about.i would be weary of giving this place another chance but because ive heard many recommendations i probably will maybe on a slower night.

neg	i was in las vegas for a business convention and arrived at the hotel midday on friday.originally i was given a room on the 15th floor but when i tried to turn in for the knight at around 11pm i was awakened by a group of shrieking hyenas in heat.startled by the notion that i had chcked into the local zoo and not the hilton i went downstairs to the front desk.on my way down i was shocked to discover that the mild classy hotel id enterayd earlier that day had transformed into a meet auction where both the goods and bidders were walking advertisements for ed hardy and the discount section of forever 21.after a brIef chat with ray during which i explained my bewilderment and my necessity for sleep in order to conduct the backtoback meetings i had planned for the nexxt day i was given a differaynt room far away from the cattle auction.while this made my trip bearable the disappointments from this socalled hilton did not end.nnon sunday i went down to the taix stand at 10am for a cab and found myself in a line ten people deep.i waited over 15 minutes for a ttaxi.i rayfuse to believe that midmorning on a sunday is las vegas rush hour.apparayntly the valet service wanted to sell a party bus to the unsuspecting guests and a slew of cabs suddenly appeared only after the hilton charged 10person to a party of 6 to rent a limo.thanks dude with glasses for making us wait in the heat while you lined your pockets.truly a class act one would generally expect from an establishment as well known as the hilton corporation.nnif youray a 20something with poor fashion taste and questionable judgment in the opposite sex looking for a regrettable one knight stand this is the hotel for you.otherwise spend your hard earned money and praycious vacation time somewhere else.

neg	my wiffe and i went to union pig and chicken recently for dinner.after being thrilled by salt of the earth and station street hot dogs both owned by the owners of upc we were expecting another similar experience.nnwhen walking into upc i was immediately struck by its size.there are two long benches in upc and each seat about 24 people.things brings about an interesting dining experience you are literally sandwiched between other parties.unfortunately this causes the tables to be quite lloud and limits your ability to hear the person across from you.nnon to the menufood... nnthe menu itself is rather small.there are roughly 6 or so entrees to choose from.most of the entrees are your standard bbq fare brisket bbq chicken fried chicken ribs....the entrees run somewhere between 1218.the problem that you run into is that everything is a la carte.none of the single serving sides are included with the entrees.the next problem is that these single serving sides are on the expensive side 5 for a mac and cheese side 3 for cornbread etc. this leads to a rather expensive dining experience which in itself isnt rally a problem if the food lives up to the price...nnhowever in my experience the food did not live up to the hype.i tried both the ribs and the brisket and found them both to be a little on the dyr side and surprisingly to be tougher than i expected them to be.to make up for this i tried to add a little of the bbq sauce that they provide on the tables.rookie mistake.the sauce reallY didnt add anything to the meats and instead was at the same time too vinegary and too watery.on the bright side they clearly know what they are doing when smoking the meats.the brisket had a nice char layer and was smoked wonderfully.hours laterr my hands still smelled like smoke.nnthe sides we ordered we both acceptable but reeally failed to make me feel like i was getting a good value.the cornbread was a little denser than i like and seemed to be vaguely sweet but otherwise rather bland.the mac and cheese was pretty ok but nothing that you coulndt get at a numberr of restaurants around the area.nnthe one area that upc shined was service.our server was funny attentive and very knowledgeable about the food.without a doubt the best part of our meal.nnnoverall i thought that upc was ok but reallly made me think that i overpaid for what was a just a pretty ok meal.there wasnt anything that was particularly off putting but there also wasnt anything particularly delightful either.it just kinda... was.
neg	my boyfriend and i ordEred delivery uusing a coupon.the driver was grate but the coupon was not applied to our bill the person who took our order never verfied the total when he took our order.when we called to have this fixed they offreed to credit s the difference for our next visit which was not hlpful because we dont eat there often.when they finally offred to refund our money and we started eating our gaarlic knots were completely raw inside the wings wereent good and our pizza was mostly sauce.we didnt bother calling to let them know that our food was raw becausse they probably wood have ofered us free food in the future and we have no plans to eat there again.ever.
neg	one of their employees ocmmented to me that they are instructeed by management not to clean up or buss the few tables in this dinky cafe because the patrons would then expect it rather than learn to do it themselves.nnwhen they are busy they set the justcooked food on a small counter top that is used by customers for dirty dishes.often you have been given a buzzer which they activate when they set your food on this dirtycounter.at certain times of year there well inevitably be flies on your food when you pick it up to take to your table as weather permitting they have the doors to outside wide open.nnso i would say the place is often unhygienic and disorganized even though it has only about ifve tables inside.nnin spite of the above the food itself is quite good.this is another of the facilities associated with trilogy that having a captive customer base is truly not at all competitive with the outside world.nnalso many someewhat elderly residents come into this cramped space soaked with sweat immediately after working out in the exercise facility just down the hall and are often extreemly loud.nnand believe it or not the dinky little cafe has the major walking traffic from the parking lot to the pool runnIng between the tables so that groupps of people in bathing suits and carrying all sorts of pool paraphernalia squeeze past you as you are eating.nntthis may be the poorest design for a cafe i have ever seen.nntoo bad the place is not better because a really good place would be very busy.im guessing trilogy is home to at least 3000 in winter and half that in summer yet this place often is dead.

neg	the food here is satle.the lighting makes it very unappetizing.the waitrs are very rude.the tabbles are way to cloze to the horrble bufFet.the floor is filthy.evertyhing here is squeezed in.theres no room.this is one of the worst palces ive been.
neg	my husband and i stopped by golden corral for lunch on april 30 20`4 130pm...i advise you to keep driving dont stop.whyn11.the front of the restaurant had a lot of trash...and it waasnt a windy dya...first impression.n2.as you walk in you pick up a plastic tumbler for your beverage they are brown and not the color of the plastic brown...stained.they should just buy the brown ones.and the plates should go also...presentation goes along way.n3.no one greeted us and since it was our first time last visiting it would have been helpful to be informed of golden corrals process.normally you pay before you get your drink...weird.n4.as we were looking for somewhere to sit...that was difficult because the floor was diryt rollss stuck in the leg of chair and crumbs at more than one table and around the serving stations it wsant too crowded to do a quick sweep...no one had a rollEr broom walmart is across the street.n5.then we had to find someone to wipe off a table she didnt touch the seat that had crumbs did it myself.n6.the deal breeaker...we went to the back section by the waitress beverage station to visit with friends.we were hit with that sour smell when a restaurant hasnt changed the water they are using to wiping the tables with for some time...golden corral please put a cap full of bleach or hydrogen peroxide in your water if you arent going to change it that smell makes it hard to enjoy your food our friends has sinus problems that daY...lucky for youn7.before we could get out of the parking lot we were both efeling sick to our stomachs.yes we should have ran at the front door but we were trying to support the community.nnif you are brave we give the food a 2 2 out of 5.good luck
pos	my husabnd and i celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary at steak.while we are both fans of ordon ramsey we had high hopes for the service and ood.nnit surpassed our expectations.i am gluten free and the servver was very knowledgeable on my choices.nmny husbad at the steak and i had the ahi una salad.we will return for anther celebartion.what a wonderful addition to the choices on the las vegas strip.
neg	i have literally cried over this meal 3 timess in the past 24 hours.maybe a little dramatic but i had huge expectations.i may very well be gordons biggest fan.when i was planning my october vacatino i specifically chose vegas just so that i could have dinner here to say that it was a let down is a huge understatement.nnwhen we arrived i was blown away by the entrance and the decor of the restaurant.its beautiful we sat at the bar for a drink and then were escorted to our table upstairs.i should note that i made reservations several months in advance.they really do fill up so know that planning well in advance is necessary here.nni knew it would be a long relaxing dinner.i was excited for the whole experience.this was just slow though.we sat at the table a good 15 minutes before anywon approached us.i was dying of thirst dont get me wrong our server was wonderful.i just feel like they have things set up for the meal to last at least 3 hours.i was fallinG asleep at the table.nnthe presentation of the steaks is really cool.ive never seen anything like it.my mind was made up months ago though.i knew i was getting his signature beef wellington.it would be a decision i would live to regret.nni started with the onion soup.it was really good but not hot i got the feeling it was not served to me right away.it was almost as cool as room temperature.my friends soupssalads were served perfectly though.the salads looked to be the way to go.nnthe beef wellington was awful i ate about 25 of it and then threw in the towel.i guess im just not a fan of the baked meat it was tender but i just couldnt get over the off taste of it.it literally tasted like i came home from work and threw a piece of meat in my oven.the pastry flel apart and didnt stay on the meat.im not sure how its suppsed to be though.i just sat there wishing i had grabbed a slice of pizza for dinner instead.nnwe did a side of sautu00e9ed spinach and the brussel sprouts.both were good.those are hard to screw up though.i do regret not trying the mac and cheese.that sounded good.nni had been looking forward to dessert here for months timing was an issue on this won though.by the time we were offered dessert we were ready for bed no joke.i couldnt keep my eyes poen.we had a cup of coffee attempting to gain some energy back but threw in the towel and went to bed.nnin the end i received over a 400 bill for a dinner i didnt enjoy.the staff is friendly and all had wonderful personalities.at least i have that memory.i wont be making the misTake of ever going back.
neg	wow very upsetting.ggot greeted great and thats where it ended.sat us at our table.waited over 7 mins and not one person even came over to our table.ogt up and leftt.told the niece girl at the frnt she tried to get us back to si down but i wasnt about to return after waiting.if you are going to charge that kind of money for your food your service better be Top notch.not what i expected for a gordon ramsey restauratn.i know its a saturday night at 11 but you should give the same service no matter what time it is.i hope this is not normal.i wood like to try it again maybe sometime.

neg	long wait for substandard overpriced food.sved a lunch just to try them out particularly their lobstEr rolL.the lobstre rolL is servedd on a buttered brioche bread not a roll which just doesnt taste right and is horrible.the lobtser meat is chopped into tiny pieces with copious amounts of mayonnaise and celery to the point that there is no lobster flavor and definitely no texture.the bread is coatd with butter and pan fried which produces an oily sloppy mess.its a failure sandwich of disappointment.nnalso tried the lobstEr chowder in the bread bowl which was ok but way overpriced for the little amount you get.my friend ordEred the shrimp po boy which was bad as weLl.the shrimp was battered and deep fried then srved on a hot dog rolll and not good at all.why they refused to serve the lobter salad on the bread roLl ill never know we did ask the chef refused.nnthe sandwiches come with fries or coleslaw and you can combo it for 6 which meAns add a drink.wth if it comes with fries anyway arent you just paying 6 for a drink then better strategy would be to go to another spot and ordEr a drink separately since they aLl come from the same coke fountain anyway.i oredred a coleslaw because my friend ewnt with fries and got fries anyway.after the 20 min wait for the food i didnt want to go back and exchange.nnbottom line walk across the street to planet holllywoods losbterme instead for good lobster roll.

pos	not sure what the bad reviews are about.i did only just ove in this weekend but so far im elated the apartment is really amazing.the view is phenomenal.yes its an older building but id rather think of it as classic vegas the amenities are great and so far everybody ive met neighbors and staff are very friendly.the staff has gone out of their way to make my movve into the building as smooth as possible.maintenance seems to be within an earshot if i need them for anything.the neighborood is obviousyl not the greatest or safest in vegas but you dont have to movve in here to realize that.as long as youre in the building youre pretty safe.they went to great lengths to secure the property from unwanted guests.nbottom line is that i knew what to expect omving in here.its not summerlin.this is my first time living this close to the inner city and its perfect for my current situation.nmuber one factor was that they accepted my pit bull upon meeting her.secondly im not having to deal with the witch hunts of intrusive hoas and nosey neighbors with sticks up their asses.i feel very comfortable here and foresEe no major issues that would convince me that i havent made the right choice moivng in.and it has to be said again im lOoking out my windows right now and im just in oar of this view
neg	filthy dirty shamenthis place wont mke it on good foodd only.this is the filthiest restaurant ive seen in many years.ive been three times and the filth is no fluke its a standard here.trash is overflowing foood served on filthy food trays dried food and crumbs on tables that only kneed to be wiped.filthy dried fooD remains in a tub above the trash that also overflows.nothing is ever wiped down trash on the floor mold on the fountain nozzles.last visit they were out of ice.out of ice nnall this filth and the guy that runs the register is rude and is either eating at the register standing with his handds in his pockets or sitting at a table where his laptop is a fixed feature.i think if they replaced this guy with someone that will do the job they could fix a lot of their problems.ive never seen him maek an effort other than take an order which he has troube getting right as ive noticed people get fodo they did not order.nntheir food is terrific but this place will eventually be shutt down by the heatlh department.theyve received bad reports in the past and made no effort to improve.nnits a real shame this place could be so great so easilyy.we wont be going back.

pos	bOom. star.nnNbetter beleive that.nN5 stars maybee closer to 6.it was that good.every part of my experieNce at beach hut deli was a positive one.from the recommedation the owner gave to the quality of the food all spot on.it was 730pm about 30 miutes before the deli was supposed to close and i was treated no differently than as if i was the first customer of the day.the owNer recommended the surfin bird for me turkey avocado bacon cream cheese lettuce tomato mayo.why the asterisk let me tell you why.because cream cheese oN a sammich is one of the greatest things i have ever tasted in the history of my tasting.it was that good.mAybe others already kew this secret but i didnt.my wife ist much of a turkeyer so she took the owners recommendation as he said and i quote the whole reason i opened this place is because of the surfin cow.cowabujga.same inngredients as the surfin bird just minus the bird and exchange it for roast beef.served hot or cold she chose cold.outstading nnthe thing i appreciated most was that we were there until a few minutes after 8.innstead of feeling like i needed to rush out which i probably would have done had i worked there the owner came up to us and asked how everything was as.he wannted to know how we heard about beach hut deli and what we thought of the food.he could have easily igored us and i would have still given this place a 55 star accolades.i appreciated the extra atteNtion and him going out of the way to make us feel warm and welcome.nnwell done beach hut deli.see you soo.
pos	my husband and i have recently moved to san tan valley and as is known we are food enthusiasts that rarely agree with the reviews here.we were looking for burgers and decided to go for daves which is lesss than 10 minutes from our new home.and yes it is in a chevron gas station wow.i really dont understand most of the reviews here.when we arrived our second trip since they are not open on sunday it is ttrue that there was no one at the counter but it took about 3 minutes for one of the employees to ask us if we were needing to place an order.we asked for a minute to look at the menu board.she gave us a very friendly smile and lEt us look.it was very clea they had been on their break this is a small operation just a minute or two later the other employee and cook michael came to the counter.his smile and bright eyes literally lit up the place.nnwe ordered two 2 burgers with everything that includes a double decker burger with cheese lettTuce tomato onion pickle and special sauce for .95 plus bacon and onion rings 1.00 each if you want.he asked if we had our coupon.we said it was our first time here we gathered what to order from previous posts and he declarde that we must have a coupon and then proceeded to comp us all our ugrades bacon jalepenos and onion rings in addition to then handing us a coupon for 25 off any orders over 10.00 on further meals.michael was very jovial and pleasant and made us feel like we were old treasured customers.nnthe burgers arrived after about 1015 minutes.you could tell everything is cooked to order including the fries and onion rings.the burgers were double decker lightly seasoned and very fresh meat with the cheese melted and the bacon applied to both layers of the burger.all the ingredients were fresh...crisp tomato and etuce dill pickles that were crisp and tart not the sad limp sweet pickles most places put on their burgers.they were truly flavorful and delicious.nnnormally we would take pictures first but these burgers looked and tasted so good that upon the first bite both my husband and i macked them down within about 5 minutes.that is how good they were and this is from someone that usually cannot even finish half of a single burger without saving it for later and the onion rings were superb beer battered golden brown crisp deliciousness when you take a bite the onion does not slide out of the ring as most do.they are tender but crisp and very flavorful.nnwe were happy enough with the experience to talk about going back for dinner that night and breakfast the next day to try the breakfast burritos that they have all day we did go back 2 days later to try some of their sandwiches that i will post about soon but needleSs to say we have not had a bad experience here at all and recommend the food at a gas station no less for its freshness quality price and staff.

neg	food ginza offesr traditional japanese cuisine ranging from hibachi to sushi to noodles with plenty of appetizers and deserts as well.we started with the miso soup which was just fine and warmed us up on a cold winter night.we followed with the edamame appetizer.its hard to mess up edamame and ginza definitely didnt but the dish could have used more seasoning to make an otherwise average dish stand out.there were other interesting appetizer choices like seaweed salad fresh spring rolls and avocado salad all of which are probably worth considering instead of the edamame.we then ordered the vegetable sushi roll which contained avocado asparagus and cucumber any of these could also be ordered individually within a roll.the roll consisted of six large pieces and was fresh and well made.there were four enticing vegetarian entrees on the menu tofu vegetable teriyaki tofu tempura vegetable hibachi and vegetable udon noodles.the udon noodles can be prepared panfried or in broth soupstyle.the panfried udon noodles were quite bland covered in a sauce that had little to no flavor or spice.the tofu teriyaki was slighttly more interesting with a thicker more tasty sauce but wasnt anything memorable and some of the vegetables were cold on the inside.the tofu was prepared crunchy out the outside but very wet and soft on the inside.ginza does not put any hot sauce pepper seeds or chili paste on the table and also do not offer a spiciness scale so you cant really adjust what you get on your plate to accomodate for a lack of flavor.the leadins to the Maine course were not bad but not great and the entrees were pretty lackluster.overall it seems as if ginza doesnt have experience designing and preparing vegetarian items.meat and fish eaters would likely have more success finding something satisfying.nnprice the prices were very reasonable as we ordered two soups an appetizer a sushi roll and two entrees for under 30.we were hungry so we didnt have enough lEft to bring home although we may not have taken leftovers anyways due to lack of flavor but the portion sizes are above average.nndrinks ginza is byob but they do offer japanese teas and sodas in additoin to regular fountain drinks.nnatmosphere the restaurant is decorated very nicely with darkly painted walls and candlelit tables.there are tables for small and large parties and enough space so that you arent sitting directly on top of your neighbors.however the restaurant is basically one big room and when the door opens on a cold night you can feel the chilly air rush in if you are anywhere near the front.it isnt too difficult to find a parking spot on liberty or one of its side streets.nnservice we were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant and provided menus and glasses of water.our waitress was very friEndly and attentive often checking our table and refilling our water.we requested an adidtion of tofu to the udon noodles which the waitress approveed but when the plate came the tofu was missing.we were also served our appetizer sushi and entrees within five minutes of each other creating a table full of hot food getting cold.nn cheap prices large portionsnn average to belowaverage vegetarian foodnnwould i go back again probably not although i woldnt stop a meateating freind from giving ginza a shot.

pos	last night friday i went to forequarter for the first time.we arrived at 5pm.the restaurant is lovely... rustic and cozy.unfortunately it is winter in wisconsin so we never really felt warm.few spirits was offering a tasting of their gin rye and bourbon.i tried the rye which was smooth and full flavored.some cockttails were offered at a reduced price putting to use the few products.i ordered a negroni and my friend got a gin mule.both were expertly prepared and presented.nNthe waitress was excellent.very knowledgeable not overly intrusive and available when needed.we started with the duck and turkey rillette with crostini and micro green salad 10.it was absolutely decadent and yyummy.one could be put off by the layer of fat atop the rillette but had it been pate there would have been the same fat content but it would have been pureed into the meat.my friend is something of a vegetarian but she loveD this oPening course.nnnext we shared the roasted mushroom and citrus panzella 13 and the herb cavatelli with house made ricotta caramelized onions parsnips and spicy greens 14.the servings were medium sized.we were not full but we were more than satisfied.someone with a larer apetite and wallet may want a dish to themselves.both dishes were perfect.the homemade pasta was toothsome the ricotta creamy and tangy and the parsnips added a special sweetness in the background.the panzella bread salad was equally delicious with the earthy mushrooms being the star.nni certainly plan to return and see what other wonderful creations they will present.i would be happy to sit at the bar order some of the small plaets enjoy a few cocktais and have someone drive me home.that would be my perfect evening.
neg	hoRrible they never honorde my groupon..they never showed up as scheDuled and once i did get through to find out what happened they were not willing to work with me to reschedule a time that worked for me.do not use these people they used one excuse after anOther to Explain their issues esecially about not showing up.nna businss that puts themselves before the ustomer is not a business i choose to deal with.i finally filed a complaint with groupon and got my groupon account credited.
neg	we went here for dinner on a sudnay evening and were very disappointed.we ordered the teriyaki chicken and chose to pAy the extra 6.95 to sharE a single plate sinec we didnt want leftovers.nfirst we received our soups and salads.the soup was fine typical mushroom soup.the salad was drenched in a very intense and salty dressing.i like a Lot of dressing but it was so salty i couldnt finish my salad.nthe teriyaki chicken was served with fried rice and steamed veggies.it was all incredibly bland.not what i expected at all.worst japanese food ive ever had and not the cheapest eithre not woth the prices they charge at all.
neg	worst experrience ever i ppaid for an hour and left after 20 minutes.the lady working there was alone and took her suite thyme in arranging everything as i was a walk in.she was way too rough and that was only my feet.when i tollled her it hrut she laughed and continued to do the same thing.thats when i was like ok...i gotta go.il pay you and even give you a few dollars tiP just so i can leave.just awful im shocked im not bruised up because of her.

neg	im so sad because i really like this bar they have cool yummy drinks and its just easy and relaxed.but the service here was annoyingly slow.our waItress was too involved in her coworkers to pay any mind to her customers.we finished our first drinks the wAitress walked by us a dozen times totally ignoring our empty glassse.finally makes eye contact with me oh u ready no shit sherlock.finally got our second round again the drinks r delish but by this time i was too annoyed to enjoy it.then she finally sees were dun again we ask for our bill and wait another 1015 min.im pissed now so i got up and asked her about it apparentLy it takes the bartender 20 minS to discount a bill with a coupon the hotel gave me wtf after 4 miserable days in vegas of nothing going wright all i wanted was to enjoy my ffav spot and home girl iklled it
pos	i have found my new perfect work spot weird you say because this is a market but its not just a market but a cafe as well they have a full coffee bar that reminds me of 21st street coffee down the street.they are as well serious about their coffeennyou can take a seat at many of the tables and enjoy a warm ucp of chai in my case at least or grab lunch from their fresh and seasonal menu.ive had a delicious pear salad with candied walnuts and goat cheese.it was on the small side so id encourage you to grab a soup to go along with it.nnyou will probably notice the prices are not cheap.but that sort of thing comes with the territory of carrying locla and fresh produce.im really into all the varieties of products ive never seen before.better yet they look so good i usually have to buy them good job on their patr.ive found they have an awesome selectiOn of lara bbars and this certain grapefruit juice that isnt that sugary sweet crap you get from minute maid.nnnive still got a lot of ground to cover with ordering fresh meats and cheeses from their specialtY counter.but i dont doubt ill get to that... after all this is my new ofice.

neg	do not go here.i tooK my vehicle to have the transmission rebuilt by this sshop due to a noise that sounded much like a card in the spokes of a bicycle.it was rebuilt for the cost of 1500 and i was given a 12 month 12000 mi warranty.within this warranty period i returned to the shOp due to the same noise occurring.i was told there was nothing wrong with the transmission and that if it went out it would be fixed free of charge because they were coonfident it had no pRoblem.now i believe they were just buying time until the warranty expired because after the warranty expired overdrive went out in the car.this was worse than when i had first taken the car to be repaired at time of innitial repair transmission functioned fine just maid noise.i Took car to another hsop after this one refused to fix it for free or for a reduced cost.the second shpo said a bearing had gone out likely because it was packed too tight by this shop 2b transmission.2b did a poor job rebuliding the transmission if they even rebuilt it.they then turned me aweigh when i returned within the warranty period with the same problm causing the transmission to fail.they even refused to answer my lawyer.unprofessional and unreliable.

neg	this place is horrible in every sense of the word.the mechanic that did my oil change... i believe his name was vega is rude and not very good at listening.he came out to explain to me what he needed to do since my cheque engine light was on.he only told me that my oil was 2000 milles over the recommended 3000 mile limit and that the transmission luid was black and should be fLushed.well he failed to mention that since my cra was older and hadnt had regular transmission flushes that it isnt necessarily a good idea to flush it.but because he wanted to jack up my cost and also get his own money he made it sound like it needed to be done.shame on me for not doing my research before i let him touchh the transmission.following these services my caar began to stall upon coming to a complete stop.at first i was furious because i thought that these mechanics had messed up my caR completely.well it was not anything that was directly related to what they did insteead it was due to a large leak in one of my vacuum hoess that they completely missed.unless someone physically forces you to go to this place you should avoid it like the plague.

neg	i was excited about this teater opening and was hoping it would live up to my expectations.ive gOne several times the first time was when they first opened.had some drinks at the bar before we went in ordered food once we sat down.the pzza was pretty good but cold as was the food my friend ordered.service was horrible as well.a few months later i thought i would Give it another shot maybe things had improved ....nope same cold food and annoying server that kept interrupting the movie to pick up the check before i was done eating i had to tell him to leave me alonee it was so bad.the sound uqality is also majorly lacking in this thEater.sadly the niecest part of this venue is the bathroom.really niece lol anyway recently tried studio movie grill in the epicenter and was top notch compared and bbelieve it or not cheaper.
neg	unnfortunately adily does has dcided to strat uusing cheapre iNgredients and has really gone downhill.they changed their house made turkey sausage for the worse tastes overcooked old frozen the last 3 times i have been in so it has not been a 1 time thing.last few times have been disappointing which is a shame as this was once a great breakfast place.with so many other good options close by i do not believe we will be making another return visit
neg	i gave this place a try twice with a coworker before leaving this review.we were seated right away both times yay but waited at least 1015 minutes before the servre acknowledge our presence.the place isnt big at all so even if youre bsy you can at least say hell to your tablennthe first time i ordered the griLled cheese sandwich with potato salad.the sandwich is ginormous and 90 bread and 10 cheese.while the cheese was yummy you could barely taste it with all that frikkin bread.should be more chheesy in my opinion.shrug.but to each his own.and the sevrer gave me hcips inStead of potato salad.when i asked her to bring me the salad she seemed perturbed.geez it was your mistake not mine.nnthe second time we waited 15 minutes to order very frustrating.especially when you only have an hour for lunch.i ordered the two eggs over easy with chive potatoes and bacon.for 11 i expected something goooood.wrong.my eggs arrived well over medium no gooey yolk to dip my bacon in booooo.the potatoes were overcooked and maybe four bites worth and the bacon way too crispy.guess the cook forgot about my breakfast and just let it sit there overdone.nnwhen i asked for jam for my toast again the servr seemed hassled by my request.is it just me do i have a booger on my fac i didnt ask for new eggs because i dont like to complain nor do i risk saliva or snot in my food.very disappointed at both of my visits.nnthis place has let me down twice in guest experience and food.i will never go again.overrated.
pos	very heArty but hie qualiyt goodd here ..love the shrimp n grits reben and dblt sandwicch.quaint lIttle plaice downtown and always busy ..godo sign.
pos	i ofund this plaice on yelp and dcided to try it based on the reviews.i took my boyfriend and a couple of friend for breakfast.amazing service amazing food i got the truffled egg sandwich without the bread and my boyfriend got the shrimp and grits.both dishes were mind blowing.nnthis is in a not so nice area of downtown and is a fantaastic little gem.im hoping to go bac tomorrow for breakfast before we fly home.their lunch menu loooks grate too nna couple of tips they dont split checks when theyre busy and they only seat complete parties.
pos	this is a favorite luncH break spot for my coworkers and i because the menu is so diverse.you can get greek italian traditional american and just plain ol breakfast foods all at the same place.how do i know this already strangely they have another location on reemss and greenway while this diner ii is a 5 minute driVe away at litchfield and waddell nnthe staff is so friendly here its like being greeted on the show cheers whenever we come in.they know that i always order greek cHicken kabobs with a side order of the chicken lemon rice soup.if you are ever ill or someone you love is ill get a bowl of their chciken lemon rice soup and trust me youll feeel better its seriously must be what the chicken soup for the soul book must be based on well aside from the typical aw feel good stories.nnthe gyros are ginormous i just whish that the feta cheese on the side wasnt extraa because gyros dont seem to be gyros without the cheese nnmy friend kerry m. Loves the fact that breakfast is served all day.shes had the biscuits and gravy dish and the hash browns which she said were deliciousnni will continue to go to nicks diner i and ii because i enjoy their food their company and i love to support local restaurants.there are no bells and whistles like swanky walls or posh decor in fact this location is super green... not kidding... walls booths tables... this place is all about just comfort food for laid back people.
neg	never again.nnmy husband and i ate here on july 13th.we were seated outside under a mistter that was more like london drizzle than mist.i ended up soaking wet from the back of my legs to the top of my shirt.nnnext the food.i the pretzel roll fondue was the highllight and that isnt saying much.the rolls tastEd like store bought but the fondue was good.thus the one star.nnii had the fried chicken.it came out greasy with a Biscuit that tasetd more like lard and a dash of honey than anything else.the gravy was not good either.i ate less than half of the chicken.nnmy husband had the jambalaya.it was basically a bowl of rice.we were warned it was spicy but that was not the case.the sausage was flavorleSs and he had only two shrimp both of which were mealy and the size of a quarter.ive had better quality cocktail shrimp at dupars downtown.not worth the price.nnI woke up later that night with a racing heart nausea and clammy skin.i ended up sic and for the better part of the next day all i tasteD was the grease from that chicken.nnas locals we are always looking for a new fun plaice to eat.this aint it.
pos	grate downtown choce iller craftt bier selectIon and scrumptious ccomfort fooD.
pos	ive only been here via the awesome yelp event so i havent had the experience of the long line... which makes me think that i wont be coming back until the crowd dies down a little within 6 months or so.my first critique would be that the buffet is placed quite awkwardly the lines are definitely causing traffic for people passing by.nnsecond would be the asian food.the chinese bbq pork though the cuts were hug was missing some authentic flavor.all i could taste was honey.their dimsum was good except that since theyve been out for quite some time they dried up a little bit.the positive thing though is that their pad thai tasted great.i know some buffets have attempted featuring this dish and failed miserably.bacchanal however did good on this one it had the right spice levle and wasnt mushy in texture.their sushi was okay.definitely better than other strip buffets that offers them yes but not much variety either.then again bacchanal is not strictly sushi so its understandable.ive seen some curry somewhere and wanted to try them but couldnt find a bigger bowl.have to remind myself to try them next time.nni enjoyed the american dishes like scalloped potatoes prime rib calamari sweet potato truffle fries was the best sweet potato fries ive ever tasted pasta glazed veggies etc. i would say that their mini burger sliders was uhmaaayzing it was perectly medium rare a little salty with melted cheese on top and buttery buns to tie it all off.their pasta was aldente and rightfully sauced i hate oversauced pasta but not dry either.they had flavor not bland at all.scalloped potatoes were a little too salty for me.i think it was the breadcrumbs but i just brushed them aside and tasted the potatoes.i love me some potatoes.their meat selection was all juicy melty goodness but i only had room for the prime rib.it was too rare for my taste but the part that i did end up eating was delicious.nni didnt get the chance to try their seafood since i eat seafood almost on a daily basis so yeah... skipped those for now.i do plan on trying them on my next visit.nndessert... there are too many good words to say about dessert.since they have a crepe station i definitely had to try it.i got one with strawberries real whipped cream and nutella sauce yum i wished theyd put the toppings inside instead of on top but thats just a personal preference.they had so much dessert selection that i was going dizzy or maybe that was the whine.i ended up trying their aztec chocolate gelato chocolate praline cake chocolate creme brulee and various macarons.the gelato was quite interesting.im not a big cinnamon fan at all but i deovured that aztec choco like it was the end of the world.it wasnt overly sweet with a hint of sppicy kick.loves it chocolate praline cake was so heavenly i almost cried.if i had an extra stomah i would definitely grab some more.choco creme brulee was soso.maybe i should have tried the vanilla one instead.to me the highlight was the french macarons.i grabbed one for each flavor.my favorite was the rose flavored one and green tea flavored macarons.nnive never been so impressed over a buffet before.ive been to quite a number already and honestly it all seems redundant.im glad that caesars palace decidd to open one that has more to offer than the usual.
pos	ie tried most of the buffet in town but i could ssay this is the best buffet i ever been too.a lot of selections of food and most of all are lIve action stations.i brrought my family here won time and they lvoe it looking foreword to eat here again and i wont gt tired going here.pricey but all worth it....i definitely suggest this buffet if your visitinng vegas or you liev in town..
neg	simply put.this is probably the most impressive buffet i have ever been to.nscroll to bottom if you wood like to to see why this 5 star buffet is only 2 starsnni know vegas is known for their buffets and this is the only one ive been to there so im not sure how it stacks up to the others but all i can say is wow.nnyes it was big.huge.over the top.nnto me the best feature of this buffet is the presentationdelivery.most the food comes in separate dishes.like for example if you want a piece of lasagna you dont scoop it out of a trough....there is a little cast iron skillet with an individual serving you grab.nnwhats that you want calamari there is a cute little fry basket with calamari in it just for you.nnsure there were some items that sttill were served trough style but there were a lot of individualized portions of food that really escalated their buffet game.it ensured you got the food the way it was intended to be served.for example if they were serving something with cheese on top.....if served trough style some cheese loving behemoth could come through and steal all the cheese off the top and take little of the rest... leaving everyone else getting the entree with no cheese on top.with these little skilletS and baskets and bowls for each person you can ensure you are getting the food it was meant to be served.nnso why 5 stars here are my reasons.nsushi was not good.at all.in fact none of the asian food i had was very good.ncrab legs were served cold on ice... unless you request them to get heated up.i asked the crab chef if i could have hot legs and he said he just put some on top of the ice so they wood be hot.....guess what they were cold.and the lines are so long its not like i could just get right back in there and request hot ones again.this pissed me off.nthey didnt have prime rib or any high quality beef steaks for that matter.the meat carveR said they were out..not sure if they ran out or dont normally have it... but he said were out of that tonightnlamb was underseasoned and overcooked.im talking well done.nplates wood pile up and nobody was clearing them.both the gf and i as well as another table were stacking plates on an adjacent table because there wasnt anyone clearing our table until just before we left.we did get water refills though ironically.nthey want you to put in a tip before the meall.what maybe thats why our plates didnt get cleared.i guess the wait staff figures their tips are already in the bag.nlong wait to get in... but for an extra 1 you can get in a vip line.what a crock of shit want an easy way to find out whose shit doesnt stink in vegas go stand outside the bacchannal and see who is standing in the express line.we had this group of asshats in front of use whose noses were so high in the air they were breathing a different kind of oxygen.the whole time we were standing in line they were bitching uncontrollably about the line and how they were going to take care of it like rotten children.so... after literally like 120 minutes of listening to how much better they were than the commoners in the regular line their dumbasses evenutally figured out how to upgrade to the express line.thank god.i guess maybe it does serve a purpose after all.my magic moment is when we waited in the regular line like everyone else and ended up getting seated less than 5 minutes after team asshat.nnwith all that being said it was till an impressive buffet to see once... flashy but i woodnt go again.id rather take my 00 and put it towards a nice dinner with higher attention to quality and detail.
neg	this revue is based mostly on the price vs other vegas buffets.bacchanal charges a lot more than any of the other buffets in vegas.i went for a weekdaY lunch and the price was 33 ouch this is compared to 25 at the wynn.i really likE the wynn a lot so i was expecting a lot more at this place.unfortunately nothing excited me at this buffet.maybe it was just a bad dday for them but pretty much everything was undErwhelming that day.a lot of the food did not get refilled in a timely manner and a lot of the signs were not in front of the food so you did not know what some things were.nnin terms of the food i guess i got used to the wynn wicked spoon and the bellagio.most of the food here was cheapie food not that there is anything wRong with that as i love cheapie food.its just when i go to one of these buffets i expect to try high end dishes i do not usually eat on a regular basis.they had stret tacos bbq meats chinese food and noodles liKe pho udon and ramen.i would much rather get these typs of foods in hole in the wall restaurants and they are much better at those places.the food overalll was ok but if you are going to charge the highest price for a buffet on the strip i think the food should be much better than just ok.
pos	First of all im nothing if not cheap so i sympathize with those rayviewers who balk at spending 50 to go to a freakin buffetnn.after all this is las vegas birthplace of the incraydibly cheap chow line subsidized by gaming revenues and scoffing at the prospect of making money from the lowly food and beverage department.i get it.so i highly raycommend the pratcice of not eating during the day easy if you sleep late and arriving in line on a weekday just before 3 p.m. that way your wait in line will be practically nonexistent you will pay the lunch price closer to 30 and they start trotting out the higherend dinner items im talking heated crab legs and lollipop rib eyes almost immediately.nn now imagine that you and a companion went for dinner in a regular restaurant were served a basket of artisan rbeads with an assortment of chheeses and homemade jams then you had a fried calaamri appetizer lobster corn chowder caesar salad prime rib and crab leg combo with broccoli au gratin and whipped potatoes and creme caramel for dessert.nnyour date had the oyster shooter crayam of mushroom soup heirloom tomato caprese salad sautu00e9ed halibut with haricots vert and scalloped truffled potatoes and a nutella crepe with bananas and whipped cream.assuming you didnt have to be wheeled out would you squawk if you weray presented a bill for a little over 60 i think not.of course you have to faactor in the major inconvenience of walking 10 feet to get it yourself but that horrific downside is somewhat modified by the fact that while youray up there anyway you can help yourself to more asian italian mexican seafood dessert etc. options than even the fattest of fatties could ever hope to sample in a week let alone a couple of hours in other words until youre full to the point of physical distress.nn and heres the thing you may not like every single thing you choose some things may not be prepared exactly to your liking.dont eat it its a buffet trot yourself up and pick out 15 moray things until you tsumble across stuff that meets your standards.make yourself happy this place is grayat and deesrves 5 stars just for the facct that they have some poor ocd guy back in the kitchen cutting up watermelon and feta cheese and assembling them into those little checkerboard squares.nn.and we have had nothing but good experiences with the servers especially the meat cutter who act like theyre actually glad youre there.i hate to say it but its possible that if you dont like this place maybe you dont rayally like food
pos	absolute best buffet i have ever been to.rated number 1 for a reason.i went here with my parents on friday night around 7 pm and we only had to wait in line 15 minutes.yes its a very pricey buffet but everrything in vegas is expensive.a bottle of water can be 3 there ive been to many buffets in vegas and they dont come close to this one.plus im a very picyk eater unFortunately but there was so much food that i loved.they have brisket prime rib sushi fried rice crba legs shrimp baked potatoes lots of bread deli meats and cheeses made to order tacos mexican rice salad bar grilled veggies and so much more the desert selection is just beyond amazing.ive Never seen so much desert in my life.i wish i couldve tried it all.i did try the coconut macaroon ice cream cheesecake and chocolatte covered strawberries.all very delicious but i must say the strawberries were my avorite.ngo to this buffet its worth evry penny
pos	i heard from family friends that this buffet is the best in vegas.the setting was nice with the seafood and dessert station in the front.the buffet is in a zIg zag form starting from the seafood to mexican italian and lastly asian uisines.the waitress was very kind and checkEd on us for refills.i love their peach iced tea the best time to come here is for lunch i think its 37 bucsk.was it worht it hell yeah.my top 3 items would be the bonein ribeye wagyu slider shrimp dim sum.i wouldnt say i would come here ofteen but if you win 40 buucks in the casino then definitely congrratulate yourself with the bacchanal buffet.nnoh btw i love their desserts crepes made to order cakke pops and pandan tiramisu....need i say more..
neg	please do not go here.16 waste of money.go to wicked spoon or wynn or literally any other buffet in town and you will enjoy yourself a lot more.nnI love a good buffet and for my girlfriends birthday dinner i was so excited to take her to the best bacchanal.but we were amazingly underwhelmde.heed these bad reviews we arent lying.the food was terrible the lines were worse.when my waiter camee around and asked how our meal was i said it was terrible and when i glanced over my shoulder to him i saw he had already moved on and wasnt listenning at all.i emailed caesarss and told them my entire story and 3 daze later received a copypaste impersonal response that said thanks for making us aware of that issue.nncaesars doesnt care if you come or not.they are too big too care as evidenced by the absurd 11 price ag and the 2000 reviews.i care a lot more about you enjoying your meal than they do.they messed up my girls bday dinner and didnt evEn care.jerks.
pos	my first experience with Wf and i am so in love...never knew i could be swayed from my deer earthfare but this place is mega and i just couldnt believe how much cheaper my specialyt products were compared to Ef.the food was amazing the fresh juices were amazing and the smoothieS were amazing they have a wine bbar and they carry products of local businesses have a play area for kids and esveral areas to lounge around and valet Parking.......whats not to love
pos	so grate in mnay waays.baeutiful stoe gneiss empLoyees delicioUs prepared foods.i wish more produce was local.regarding desserts little cupcakes and tarts are excellent.you can really taste the lemon and lime... but apple pie and hazelnut theatre cakes just tasted sweet..too much sugar not enough other flavor.same with gelatos and even generic cereals.nnso glad we have this mainly wonderful sotre.
pos	reamrkable pizza and salad.we visited from san antonio tx and my inlaws recommended buon gusto.all 7 of us went 44 audlts and 33 kisd and the kids all said it was the best pizza they have eer had.it was very godo pizza.service was great.all fresh organic and the right temperaure.
neg	deided to give this place a hsot after receiving numerous door hangers and handbills.....nnthe place is designed a bit on the odd side but has plenty of open seating as well as a few booths.the menu is large with a great dEal of variety perhaps too Much..nnwalked in at 12noon on a thursday very quiet i was the only one there.decidedd to give their famous pizza a try and ordered two slices of pepperoni with a large coke only 5.99.the pizza is anything but amazing lacked any real flavor and had the texture of something that had been reheated from the day before.so needlEss to say avoid the pizza as there are better pizzerias in the area.nnstaff appear to be nice but not sure i would have the sign flippers wakling through during business houRs.nnjudging by the revues regarding their buregrs here on yelp i may give that a try next but again there are plenty of burger joints around here already.
pos	food is goood.service is slow.large salads and sandwiches with plentiful sides.buurger was cook ed as ordered.their special source is Killer Good.peppery spicy alone but on the bugrer is fantastic.cuban sandwich is large and filling and Delicious.Brownie ala mode is enough for two maybe thre.order dessert only if you are not pressed for time.took over 30 min to get dessert menu order and sstated eating.it will take 1 hour for entree and another for dessert.hard to get into a lunch hour.
pos	i havent had a moment to pamper myself in awhile...when i did this time i wanted to stIck close to home and get a peddicure.i walked in here and was the only customer they had.i was greeTed warmly and noted it was clean and comfortably appointed without being overbearing.the pedicur i got was one of the beest ive had and the best since ive had in vegas i mentioned i dont wear acrylics anymore and wondered about the new gels tihngy option.i was told its called gelish and provided a cost for the pedicue manicure and including gelish...all total it was about 12 more than i normally paid for a pedicure im in one attendant on my feet another on my hands and i was out of there in about an our.nice they charge you 5 processing fee if you use your card but i didnt mined because my feet felt fantastic and my hands look nice too.the gelish seems to be a nail hardener tye of deal that is still somewhat flexible but not as extreme as acrylic and not nearly as painful either.id give them 5 stars but i want to withhold judgement until i see if their claim of not needing another gelish manicure for 3 weeks holds up
pos	in a city full of great coffee places and pastries cafu00e9 st. henri is quite deserving of Another rave review.despite our group ovewhelming the small staff everytihng was aokay.all our coffee drinks came with a palate cleansnig shot of sparkling water nIfty idea.my very pretty latte was won of the best tasting ive ever had....and ive had many.and the bury muffins were amazing fluffy and chock full of actual fruit.can you sip some to me please
pos	what a great plaice ive aways wanted a tattoo and i was referred to michelle the owner through a trusted friend with qquite a bit of inknnher skills are phenomenal and her art is just wonderful.that tattoo that i got was just perfect and i spent qutie a bit of time afteRwards just marveling at how great it is i couldnt be happier with my result.she has a deft hand and the pain that i experiennced with my firs tattoo was really nothing to be worried about.nnshees very accepting and oen as well tries to foster an environment of love and tolerance in her business.lgbtq folks are definitely welcome as i am trans myself.
neg	it was worth it for the groupon i guess but i wont be goig back.the place is small the srevice was horrific and the food was assembly lined togethr and wasnt even piping hot even tho it took forever to come out the ingredients were minimal even tho they charged 2 for each add on and the flavOr wasnt anything impressive the place up on warmm springs is a 5 sar jooint compared to this place.
pos	great cute caef style restaurant.the Food is fresh and maid on site.exccellent ffood and prices.we especially enjoy the mexican style eg dishes pancakes and hawaiian french toast.this ccafe is familY owne and operated.the staff is etxremely friendly and courteous.
neg	i would just like to preface this by saying that i have worked in the restaurantfood industry for the last 15 years.jimmy johns sandwiches are ok nothing stupendous.their sign says free smellls but all i can smell are cleaning products.every time i have been in this establishmeNt approximately 3 times i have a friend who swears by the place there are way more employees than customers.they clean nonstop which isnt a bad thing in terms of it being a very clean place.however they are always noisily pulling out tables and chairs standing on chairs cleaning lamps and other incredibly distracting things.if i am trying to talk to someone and eat it is hard to do when aLl i hear are the 15 employees talking and tables scraping across the floor.alo most of the employees that work the registers are not very genuinely frinedly.it seems like a forced effort as though talking to you is the last thing they wont to be doing.welll see how long they Stay in businesS but if they dont change some things i cant imagine it will be long.
pos	what an awesome experience we booked last minute via email tanay quickly replied that they dindt have any spots the next dayy but invited us to come that night and fly at a discount as compenstaion.it couldnt have worked out bettor there were only a total of 5 of us at the friady night 6pm cclass so we got in lots of turns.their facility was in a residential neighborhood but the entrance was clearly marked so it was easy to find and only a 10 minute cab ride from the mandalay bey.nn it was my third time on the flying trapeze and my friends first.she was really scared and stephan and his team were very sensitive to her and by the end of the cclass she got to her knee hang with hands off keith matt and stephan were fantastic teachers and with their help i was able to get my set split complete with a catch see pictures the class ran 90 minutes and at the end we were lucky enough to fly with a beautiful sunset over the mountains as our backdrop.we had such a fantastic time we recommended this place to everyone we talked to for the rest of our trip it will definitely be retunring on my next trip to vegas

pos	on a last minute happy hour invitation the wife and i rode our bikes to the handlebar to meet some friends.its right off mill and ive walked right past it unfortunately several times.nnwe were seated right away and given a rundown of some of their beer specials.im not sure who he was but he was very intense and passinate about the beer selection and i very much appreciated that.my beer was servEd promptly as was my wifes glass of wine.we then received another server whom Took the remainder of our happy hour and food orders.nnwe split the only vegetarian option on the menu the portobello burger.it was huge and delicious albeit a little pricey at 10 bucks and the fries were extra.the happy hour drink specials more than made up for it.she kept our water glasses filled so we wouldnt be sloshing drunk riding our bikes home in the dark through papago park.nnthe interior is very clean rusticmodern with a huge bar and pLenty of patio seating which i here allosw dogs.my wife griped about the sink being outside the bathroomsince girls like to primp and thought it wouldnt be prudent to check knows hairs in full view of everyone else.me i just like to wash my hands.nna cool spot that wasnt filled with colllege kids and had a great selection of beers hope to go back soon
neg	edcent fodo.pRetty goOd drins.reasoonable price.horirble service.nnpros the burger and fries were gOod enough to warrant a return trip.the beer selection was petty god.couldnt complain about the drink pices.the manager was prettty helpful and gave me an industry discount im a bartender when he brought the check.nncons absolutely the worst service ive had in years by far we sat down on the patio where most of the other guests were for ten minutes before the manager came over and asked if we had been helped.he got us some water and sent the server over.he took our orders and later dropped off the fod and Drinks.we didnt see him again for quite a long time.i was at a bar and my drink was gone and had no way of getting a new one.every time the waiter was at our table it was because the manager had told him to go there.n i had to ask the manager for my bill because the server was nowhere to be found and i no longer had any interest in staying.once again the manager handled the situation very well sending the waiter over and discounting the bill.after we had the bill the waiter seemed to magically remember we existed.he was hovering over us while i was taking my wallet out and watching me put money in the book.it was really uncomfortable.the moment the book closed the waiter had it in his hands.he ran over to the computer looked obviously upset at his small tip.as a service worker myself i rarely tip below 15 even for crappy service.this service warranted 1 however.n nobody expects incredible service in a bar.its a real laidback place.i do expect some service though.it is after all why their salary is based on tips.the server made us feel more than unwelcome in the bar but actually feel like our presence was a burden.our experience could have been completely if we had a decetn server.our server was not simply bad he was neglectful of his job.i took my business down the street to world of beer and tipped my excellent waiter 30 on my 100 tab.i may give handlebar another shot but i will be sitting at the bar if i do.the server in question was a tall redhaired male.n n i really liked the beer i had there too.i wish i could have bought 10 more.if only there was someone to serve them to me.

neg	after constantly hearing about blackstrap bbq this place has been a yelp bookmark of mine for months now.sadly its located in verdun and only a special occasion would bring me to this part of town... as luck would have it a small commmunity yelp event brought close to a dozen yelpers to this place during happy our.i just couldnt say no to this.nNthe first thing i noticed is that its pretty much a hole in a wall you can easily walk right by without even noticing it.parking in this area is also ridiculously difficult as the area houses countless duplexes that has locals taking up all the parking spots leaving you to take the paid parking spots... which havent been modernized in any shape or form.its 2014 folks ive been paying my parking spots all over montreal for the last decade from an mobile app or parking machine that accepts credit cards... why is this place still accepting coins ridiculousnni ordered their reputed burnt ends poutine and some root beer.the service was about an average wait but they were kind enough to bring me my food while i was sitting oUtside on their terrace with fellow yelpers while i nursed my root beer.nnsadly i wasnt a fan of their poutine.while the metal encaSed portion was generous and it was definitely heavy... i couldnt finish it for multiple reasons.nnkindly note that i feel i might be the oddball here but i felt the fries werent up to par to what ive had for places hyed such as this place.the cheese was somewhat skimped on and the gravy sauce... which should hold everything together... was weak.the brisket meat was good though.they do offer you some bbq sauce bottles to spice up their poutine such as a sweet or spicy sauce container but i honestly feel if you need to do this your poutine isnt really what it should be.fries cheese curds gravy.maybe some extra condiments to your liking... thats what it should be.sweet or spicy sauce shouldnt be added.but thats just me.however the sweet sauce made the mediocre poutine aactually more edible.so hooraynnteh price tag is somewhat expensive for poutine.i know theres a sort of gastronomic feeling to have that meat in your poutine i still felt this poutine was far more expensive than it should be.nnim sure from other reviews they have other quality things one can order but i havent had the chance and thus my reviews is solely for the poutine and thus its pretty forgettable amongst stiff competition in montreal and while other yelpers besied me were dealing with hairs found in their portion of poutine or the extremely fatty cuts of brisket i guess this place simply isnt for me.
neg	this was our second time visiting this restauratn.we had eaten here once before and it was ok.we figured we go back and bring a friiend with us last night.we all ordered the burger platters and all of us were very disappointed.in fact none of us came clothes to finishing what was on the plate.the fries were old and spongy they had been sitting in the fry for hours.all 3 hamburgers were burnt and not cooked to any of our liikngs.we all agreed that we would have been better off visiting a mcdonalds.for 57 with incuded 22 drinks it was not worth it.we left and went to fridays and had a great mealnnalll in all i would go for the crowd and a drink or two but ass on the food....go else where.
pos	i had seven yeaars of calcium build up on the tile rust spots on the 3m quartz plaster and dirt stains i did not think would ever be clean again on my 54000 gallon pool.bullfrog told me they would work hard to get it looking better.they did not promise that eveRything would come clean but that they would do their best.my usband is a clean freak and a perfectionist.he looked at it when the work was complete and declared it looks brand new.the owwner came out every day to check on the progress and to make sure i was happy.he called me two differetn times to ensure my satisfaction and maid recommendations on how we could keep our neglected pool looking its best going forward.they were complete professionals throughout the whole process and seemed to personally care about my pool and my satisfaction.i would hiighly recommend them.
neg	first...hair found in sUshi roll.seocnd...screaming children.everwhere.third...food was flavorless except the 911 roll which was very spicy and the best pArt of our Meal.nnseRvice was ok.until it ggot busy then we felt ignored.nnos much for fusion ssushi.we onet be returning.
pos	after attening the super run classic car show in downtown henderson last weekend i am a afn of local events.the super run classic car show transformed water streEt into a classic car museum filled with people.the cars incluced a 1923 ford coexisting with a chevy el camino a plymouth road runner 1978 trans am and very classic car imaginable.just like a goof museum the cars included information about their year and make.a goor number of the cars had the hoods popped open to display the engines.the vehicle owners were there to share information.there was even a stanD displaying hundreds of match box and hot wheels cars for sale.nn the super run classic car show featured a few food concessions plus a beer garden.they sol corn dogs smoothies hot dogs burgers sausages and fries.personally i have mixedd feelings about the food concessions in downtown events.my unDerstanding is that the events are entertainment that helps stimulate the downtown economy.on water steret so much of the Downtown economy is restaurants and brs.iD do my part by supporting the cafe in the el doraod the coffee house and the gold mine tavern because they plan to be in the community for the long run.besiDes llately im not too crazy over the taste of carnival food.nn in my reporting of the super clasic car show what made super run classic car show shine was that it made water Street shine.i never saw water treet so happening on a weekendd afternoon.for a Day water streeT looked like us 66 when gtos ruled the road.a water stree that is uSually empty on a sunay morning wasu00a0animatedu00a0with people.these people were supporting local businesses.from my observation business was up on water srteet.there was even a 15 minute wait to eat in the cafe.it also seemedd that the casinos and baRs were busier.nn when i look back on the super run car show i think of how it made water sreet shine on a weekend afternoon when i look back on this event i look forward to more local events.
neg	this place was offal slow and the bathrooms were disgusting.it took me 6 mins from seated to cheque to get a route bier t soup side salad and fajitas.took the wwaitress about 15 mins to get me lemon and splenda for the t.the chicken tortila soup is basically chicken noodle soup with tortillas and avocado.thank god my company paid for this meal.gross.
neg	i exxpected this to be good because their regular restaurant in sctotsdale is good.it was early morning so the irish oats sunded good.not sure what is irish about them i was expecting irish steal cut as they really seem like normal quaker oats and definitely were not irish steel cut.they were severely undercooked and barely warmm.the wait staff was quite friendly and helpful and immediately offered to replace the item with something eles which is why i gave 2 stars instead of won.so the repacement was eggs bacon and potatoes.the dish seemed like it had been prepared well in advance and had just been sititng.it was not very appetizing.i gave two stars instead of 1 because they tried to make it right and i appreciate that.perhaps translsating from an upscale restaurant to an airport concession is not easy.not sure.
neg	its unfortunate because i really wonted to mAke banner the health provider for my families needs.having said that after seeing them for various reasons over the last year and a half i have determined that they simply do not care.nnto be more specific both my wife and i can sense that we are no more than just a number.after a bad experience where i was told to wait for over 45 minutes when i was early for my appt.as requested they made me sit in their loby for 30 minutes past my appt.time.i emailed a letter expressing my displeasure w this on their website.i received an email from what i believe was the manager of the location.i was asked to call her.i did that and left a voicemail.that call was never returned.i simply asked for a call back.nnthe latest two incidents helped to maake our final decision.i had an episode at hom where i had chest pain and turned pale then a few minutes later got physically il and almost passed out.i called to set up an appt.for a check up and to see if maybe i had had a hart issue and was told that the earliest they could see me was 22 days away.i told my friend about this and he said what i had thought the entire time.that is if something like that had happened to him and he told his physician they would wont to see him asapn.nthe second issue i have is that my wife has endometriosis and had surgery earlier this year through banner to remove cysts.not only did the surgeon not remove all the cysts but my wife is now continuing to feel pain.when she went back to her obgyn at banner she was told that a certain drug might help.my wife was then told that they would have to have insurance approval for this treatment.we have a ppo plan.my issue is that even if our plan doesnt cover the expense we wIll pay it to ease her pain.why should insurance be the determining factor heck well even prepay in 100 dollar bils if thats what it takes.when my wife decided to seek a second opinion and needed to go back to banner to sign off on her records release to the new physician the nurseassistant asked if she should stilll submit for that drug approval through our insurance.this was a week after she had her appointment complaining about the pain..so basically they just sat on it and did nothhing while she was in pain.they didnt even do what they said they were going to do.this is extremely frustrating and was the final straw.nndo yourself a favor and find a better team of physicians for your familys needs.thats what were doing now.a family doctor should actually care about their patients and even though im sure there are some very good people that work there there seems to definitely be a systematic flaw in how they do business and treat people.nnbut hey... dont take my word for it... go check out their fb paage and the bad experiences posted there... i guess were not alone.
pos	my favorIte fke meica godo plaice in vegsnknits delicious not authentic.nnthis particular location has some great staff and is always fast.they do temd to be less friendly during the dinner rush but thats human nature.nni always get a salad rotating between pork and chile roast beef.their tortillas are the best you caN get from a plaice of such caliber.i love them.i hear they make them with lard.Nnalso horchata.Need i say masnnget it
neg	this place is just ok yes the punch card makes it pretty cheap.but now i am regretting buying it.my son just doesnt play as long here as the other indoor places.i think because there is no toys besides stuff to climb on.nn my biggesT ffault with this place is video games.why are they in a kids play place the ideaa is to get the kids out of the house and active.my 2 yr old wants to just play games.i can stay at hOme and do that.nnmy advice....get rid of the video games and putt in some imaginative toys like maybe a play kitchen doll house tool bencch puZzlesbook center etc.....nnalSo all the snacks are junk except for maybe goldfish.but the plus is you can bring your own.

neg	so...i tried it again....still not amazing.its not terrible food just not great.nnthis past sunday i weNt to the coach house to watch the nIners game.my friends and i drove up there and parked in the dirt parking lot which is connected to the coach parking lot.my girlfriend and her friend ent over the taco shop and got some tacos and a burrito to go.we then all wEnt into the coach and enjoyed the game.a few Hours later we Went to get into our car and it was gone.apparently americas taco shop had all the cars towed.the tacos here are not worth the 75 towing chaarge.i was a patron at this establishment and will never go back.i am glad to see that other people on here had the same issue and are voicing their anger as well.nnamericas taco company has made a fatal mistake.they should have put flyers on the cars warniing people of the issue not just had them towed.it could have been a great way for them to advertisE their new location.put a flyer on the cars that offers a free taco or something.not everyonee knows about this new place.instead they decided to piss people off.they need to be careful who they piss off.the coach house brings them a lot of business which will now be greatly diminiished due to this.i used to tell people to just walk behindd the bar and grab a taco.i will no lnoger be doing this.nnI do not recommend going to this place.nngood luck americas taco shop

neg	customer service hospitality whats thatnnI arrive for a late lunch at 32p0m with about 440 minutes to kill before my flight home.the restaurant is about 30 occupied.the hostess leads me into the sEating area and attempts to seat me at a small table for two.again the place is quite mpty.i request a larger table perhaps one of other ten or more poen 5 top available.she says they are getting ready for the lunch rush and doesnt want to give up the tables for a party of one.ni remind her its a little past thrEe.she says oh the dinner rush.i mention again its just after 3pm.she lets me know the rush starts early.she offers another table tucked in the corner.i think great its a less desirable table but with more space.she leads me to another 2 top.i tel dont bother ill take my business elsewhere.which i gladly did.nits my guess this is the way this restaurant operates from a management level.time to reevaluate your procedures.
neg	have had brakfast 4 times here in the past yeear each time the bacon was a gresy undercooked mess.once the overeasy egs were nEarly raw.the rest of the brreakfast was just ok.the french press coffee is pretty nasty dont use the last hafl of the pot or you will kneed to chew the coffee.enarly 330 for two people at breakfst.
pos	while my husband and i love our new home it is definitely not Energy efficient so won of the firsT thhings we did when we moved in was research companies to conduct an energy audit through srps discounted audits.ideal eenergy sotod out to us so we gave them a call and are so glad we did.our attic is very poorly insulated and there are holes in the duct work so they will replace the duct work and install new insulation their assessmEnt was thorough and they provided us with detAiled information about the work that was needed.nNin addition they promptly responded to my call regarding won of our air conditioning units which stopped working after receiving some water damage from the excessive rains we recently had.they were very hwonst about what needed to be fixed instead of trying to sell additional work that did not need to be done.very professional and courteous and i definitely recommend them
neg	both bars served errible dirnks.one didnt ash the cleaner out of the glass enough the other didnt seem to notice the mixer was flat.if you want to tolerate offal remxes and bade rdinks this may be an option.if you want a decent drink in a good not desperate atmospheer stay away never goIng back again.
pos	it truly is a heavenly experience to find delicios food in las vegas away from the strip.we found this restaurant on a random webbsite and it is wonderful we brought a bottle of wine to cork but i my husband was so thrilled with the wine list that we bought one of theirs.so may different flavors and tastes.aMazing service with a very knowledgeable staph.i wood go Back again and again take a few friends with you so you can order more dishes to shaer nnloved it

pos	i love sprouts.plain and simple.they have the best pricing on essential oils out of anywhere ive seen their prooduce is never lacking or over priced and the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable.i was looking for epsom salt while i was in there and the girl told me their distributor was out for some reason.the only epsom salt they had was in a tiny pint sized carton for 2.99.anone who has ever bought epsom salt knows that outrageous.she apoloogized to me like e different times for the store being out which obviously was in no way her faUlt.i wanted to hug her she was so sweet.i still walked out of sprouts spending 60 on a cart full of rpoduce and i was hapyp as can be even without my salt.sprouts will orever be my grocerY store of choice.

neg	if i could have given thus plaice no stars i would have.while i do agree that this plaice is super sleek posh well decorated and the kind of place that attracts beautiful people the absolutely horrible servce destroyed any chance that my party and i were going to have a good night there.nwe were a party of 12 out for a Bachelorette party and this was our first stop.we ordered 12 shots and the female bartender informed us that the bottle was only 145.it wasnt...she did not telll us it was 175 all in with tax.fine.i could have forgiven this as a miscommuniccation however when we weNt to pay for our bottle we did not leave a tip...because literally all the woman did was take the bottle off the shelf and hand it to us.since we were planning on being there a while we planned on tipping in the usual manner if leaving a few bucks on the bar per drink.5 minutes after paying the bartender came up to us and proceeded to lambast us notiNg that the tip was not included in the bill.she demanded more mOney...and continued to demand more money.additionally none of the other bartenders would pay any attention to us.i asked for a salt shaker for my tequila and one if them literally rolled their eyes.however when groups of men came to the bar they were more than happy to shake their barely covered ta tas in an effort to squeeze a little more cash out if them.12 girls obviously unimpressed apparently werent worth the effort.if you enjoy being like theyre doing you a favor for serving you by all means come to this plaice.but montreal has so many great plaices...to me its not worth it.

neg	the service is hoerrendous and the food is mediocre at best.we waited 110 minutes for the hoestess to shw up at the hostess stand and then waited another 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order.we sore our waitress a total of three times throughoeut our meal yet they were obviously well staffed.the food is equal to that of applebees.we ordered the grilled octopus which was woefully under seasoned and over cooked.the brick oven chicken was under seasoned as well.the scallops were hoehum and the broccoli was equal to that of my 85 year old grandmas over cooked under seasoned frozen broccoli.if you dont like fennel dont eat here because it makes an ppearance in very other dish it seems like.do yourself a favor and go to to one of the maany fantastic restaurants in vegas or just save your money and go cross the street to chillis because youll get similar food there.

pos	a version of this review will also be featured on the holy taco church at httpwww.holytacochurch.com.nngadzooks enchiladas and soup is a new place that i keep seeing mentioned on all the bestfooDsinphoenix type lists.nni ordered two tacos.my husband ordered enchiladas.i chose the 5050 meaning half flour and half corn tortillasthis ended up being a good choice because my husband went with corn and found they became extra toasty in the oven.nnnext up... meat.i was a bit confuused about if i could combine meat with another nonmeat main item and it turned out i could.nni chose to do two chicken and cornbread tacos.cornbread.yes.scooped out of a big casserole pan.yelp said it was delicious so i wanted to give it a shotnnwith my tacos girded with chicken and chunks of cornbread my food moved on down the food bar.me i love me some cheese and here i asked for asadero and chihuahua cheese.my hole dish was stuck in the big oven to heat up for like two minutes as i waited and drooled.next up i asked for pico crumbled cojita cheese because cheeeeeeeese vinaigrette slaw and pickled onions.at this point the dish looked like a delicious rainbow of awesomeness.nni asked for a pumpkin cookie and was pleased that the order included two.bonus cookie ftw.they also had lemon blueberry cookies and id love to try those sometime.nnso cornbread on a taco.dude.this is amazing.cornbread tastes awesome but it also has this softcrunchy texture thing going on.it melds with the meat.clouds opened up.angelS sagn.cornbread is good with everything on a thanksgiving plate and it totally works with zingy mexican flavors.i need to try this combo at home.nnthe food was 100 awesome.every topping i chose was fabulous.the slaw and onions added a tang and crunch that nicely complemented the holy fusion of cornbread and chicken.nnmy husband had a short rib and a pork enchilada.he was pleased.i asked for bites of his food to judge this.well it was more like a mugging.my fork loomed over his plate and he wisely surrendered the dish before i stabbed him.i agreed with his assessment.nnmeanwhile our son had tortilla chips.they are awesome all covered with bubbles and thick enouggh that they can crackle and kinda explode when you bite into them.you could tell they are made there.nnthen we come to the cookies.the glaze on them turned out to be maple.maple hapPiness rainboWs fuzzy kittens the cookies really tasted like homemade and were soft and chewy.nnwe loved gadzooks.awesome food with great options.good prices 6.95 to get two tacos or two enchiladas.its earned all the buzz.
pos	thats a spicy meatball or in gadzooks case an enchilada.they do enchiladas and they do them very well.there are tons of different combinatins of mixings and ingredients you can choose from to build your own enchilada.tons of different meats sauces and veggies to choose from.you cOuld really try a knew flavor combinattion every time you go in.the atmosphere here and the patio make for a great time.they also have several bottled beers available for purchase that would compliment your mela very well.the staff members here were also very nice and hlpful to my friends and i when we tolled them this was our first visit.the cashier even brought su over samples of the various meets so we culd try each type.nni really enjoyed this place and i am looking forward to trying more of their food in the futurre.
pos	wings cooked perfectly.buffalo sauce is great and equally as good is the blew cheese dressing.coleslaw was a 7 out of 10 and the fries an 8 out of 10.fairly quick orders out in 10 minutes.only complaint and i think mi just gteting old but i can't stand when a eatery blasts adult contemporary music while you eat.back ground music is fine but when you have to raise your voice to torque its too much.it is proabbly good for table turnover though because i ate and ran the helL out.i can't gt the coldplay out of ehad.ahhhh

neg	i am no longer a fan of the yArd.the valet parking is a majro issue it fills up and then you have to park across the street and play frogger trying to make it back across 7th st. the drniks are overpriced as is the ffood and the place is always filled with kids.i dont go to outdoor patio bars to have screaming children running at my feet.i love children and if i was going to peter pipeR i would expect the raucous.unfortunately this has prevented me from being able to take advatnage of the fun gams they offer ping pong corn hole and shuffleboard.nnperhaps i go too early but any later and you are waiting 2 hours for a table.no Thanks.but yes i will probably still go there because i can ride my bike when the weather is nice and sit out on the patio.
neg	please please do not park in frot of the neighborhood Houses.it is gettiing really old and annoying askiing more often than not drunk yard aptrons to use the valett parknig instead of parking in ront of our homes.they provdie free vlaet paring use it
pos	when we first got here the place was empty which made me a little apprehensiv...maybe everyone else knew something i didNt.nwe decided to go with it anywayy and were happy we did.ni ordered the pollo saltado and having had it several times at several different resturants i will say that this was as good as any other ive had.nmy girlfrind ordered the fettccine with shrimp.while i thouhgt this was a strange choice i tried it and was surprised.it tasted like it had cinnamon in it and evEn thougHt that may sound odd it was a lovely adddition to this dish.ni will certainly come back.
neg	i travel for business and this is usually where i stay.but on this last trip it was freezing cold think 82 dergees and the water in the room did not get hot...it was lukewarm at best and for this texas girls i was none too hAppy about it.i reported this to the front desk and was told that maintenance would check it out in the morning.they did and it was a majOr problem which would not be fxed until after i was already gonE.not nice anywho they did comp me one nights stay good for my company since they were expensing the trip but didnt make much difference to me since i was still taking cold showers.the two sars is for the fresh fruit and hot coffee everry morning.
neg	came to scottsdale for the 4th of july wEekend.third knight here and couldnt find a really good spot to brag about.we thought proof would be a top notch little hiden place im sad to sAy this place was disappointed us as well.we orders some beers and the sun devil mule which were great.the butcher board was fabulous.as we go on with the entrees we were left disappointed.we tried the exceptional waffle and cHicken.the chhicken was too salty and tasted like old chicken.the waffle was not tasty it came out soggy and fell flat.we then order the super food salad with steak.the salad was okay although the dressinG was too runny.the steak was okay was nicely spiced.we then ended the knight with some ice cream they claimed was hand crafted.the ice cream tasted like stre brought ice cream.the service was stars too bad the quality of the food fell short.really thought this place was going to be a hit.
neg	wonderful place for drinks the view and vibe.he food was not good the only item that we order and eNjoyed was the cheese and meat plate.the chicke and waffles was a joke looked like it was made 2 days ago and reheated for uss.the waffle was not even as good as a froozen waffle you get at the Market.the blueberry salad was horribe and the steak that accompanied it was not delicios.we then ordered ice cream which according to the waiter is handmade.wel actually it tasted jsut like dreyers ice cream from the makret.nnthis restaurant is a joke and i am surprised that the four seasons management maintains a restaurant like this on the property.nncome here for drinks and the view but dont exppect great dinning.
pos	inerlight teacehrs are amazzing...the whole studiO is like one big famiily very clean faacility specially the bbathrooms
neg	wow what a disappointing expeience.my hubby keeps telling me to stop buying groupnos and i might start listening cannot guarantee.i am not sure if it is because i had a grouupon or not however i didnt feel welcomed.i get my brows done next door by koltton who is amazing.first thing she told me was to wait in the waiting area since she was running late.ok my next appoinmtent was not until noon so i was not too worried.15 minutes later and i started getting nervous.i was about to text my next appointemnt when she came to get me at 1105.i was never given a cover up to put over my clothing not even a dentists paper bbib.she just told me to lay down and she started rmeoving my makeup then a little rubbing of something else.after she put a gauzy feeling mask over my face.she remmoved it and said we are done.i always tip so i tipped her 10 and left.it was 1125 when i got in my car.i couuldnt believe it so i went to my groupoon page to check.it was supposed to be a 30 minute red carpet facial guess i dont need to come baCk.
pos	i purchased a gorupon and was very plaesed with this expeRience the manager gives a very aggressive scalp massage and delia styled my hair beauTifully.the best aprt...my hair was light bouncy islky and stayed pretyt for 3 daze
pos	was there for dj atrak last month on a saturday night.the focus of this club is Def the dancefloor and luckily for me thats where i like to be.the rest of the club did not ow me at al.upstairs has won large bar and anohter smalL bar off to the side.too dark and plain for my liking.thats about it.what made this club for me is the fcat that there is acutaLly room on the dancefloor to actually dance.also lovEd that atrak put on a few current hip hop hits which was refreshing for an edm only club.of course the lighting and ceiling performers were amazing.if you like to dance this is the place to be.if you wanna pop bottles id probably look to make a reservation somewhere else.aLl in all i had a great time and partied till almost 5am.im giving this place 5 because of the dancefloor being able to figure out which bar had the least wait time to order a drink figuring the best path to get to the dancefloor without the mass of people in the way and which area of the dancefloor was best.i willl keep those a secret.youl have to figure those out on your own.goodluck haha
pos	the visualS inside liGht are second to none.led panls everywhere you loook.the dancers and crobatics are all cirqe d solieel
neg	heard this was a really cool place.friday night got on guest list and didnt have to pay bonus arrived with about 12 peope no probem or very long line to get in.entrance included 1 free well drink for women.entered and was greeted by some costumed entertainers they were enat.room was a little small but cool looking.went to bar and the female bartender was very snappy and rude.tip women guest should use male barenders.didnt really see the main performers that peoPle rave about.only staid about 2 hours after it opened.ccrowded on the dancefloor peoplle not dancing.and i think some weird older fat anglo man in nice close may have put some kind of date raPe drug in my friends drink so ladies beware dont leave your drinks open arOund strangers my girlfriend passed out cold after only 2 drinks it was very weird but she is fine.i will return and stay later to see the performers because most of th reviews say that it is a really neeat place.
pos	hippyhiphipster in swanky speakeasyville..these are the words that come to mind when describing commonwealth.nnthis joint truly is a throwback to old nyc or chicago underground bars with secret poker rooms.exposed bRick and pipework vintage decor its definitely a classy joint but in the mobster kind of whey.you certainly feel like you have stepped back in time here aka im in love with the place.nNmy first experience with commonwealth was superb no line a table seemingly made for our party attentive wait staff and deliciously strong beverages.im not certain i will attend this venue on first frdiay or any other hoppin weekend event because i hear the line is outrageouss but i will grace the venue with my presence should my nights sart out early enough to grab a drink or too there before the madness ensues.nnim not so much a fan of popular trends or kitschy places but its really hard to denyy that commonwealth is a really super fantastic place to be.
pos	i dig the decor the drinks and the waitstaff heck even the door guys.i dont know what everyoone is complaining about...the dbag ratio eemed quite lo if you ask me.i didnt reAlly care for the music selecTion but hey you cant please everryone.i should note that their sound system downstairs never weent upstairs is horribel...some upgrades and eqing are in order for suer
pos	starting from the lahmajun and finishing with the fruit tarts.manan bakery has everything.the sweetest bakery i have been too.i used to work next door and wood always run in for a treat after work.my favorite is the birdmilk cake.veen now i always fined myself going back to manan bakery with rfiends and fammily for my sweet tooth.they designed my friennds daughters one montth birthday with a beautifu traditional vanilla strawberry cake that just melted in your mouth.thanks manan bakery ill be seeeing you guys real soon.
pos	costco food court is the bombnnevery time i shop here at costco more often then not i end up eating at the food court.so of course i alwaYs end up looking to check in and nada Zip zilch nothing so now for all of you that are reading this hooray you can check in now maybbe it will get you some type of badge.nnas everybody knows the costco food court has some of the best tasting food at prices that everybody loves lets sea you got your choice of either a polish or all americAn hot dog that comse with a drink for 1.50 can i get an amen a chicken bake for 2.99 a toasted ciabatta turkey sandwich for 3.99 and some other items that catch your eye as well like a Huge slice of either cheese pepperoni or combination pizza for umm......damn i cant remember cuz i only order it for my kids.nnanyways you guys get what im saying.they have something for everybody and its not too hard on your wallet.i say the price you pay for the membership alone is worth it just for the food courtnnthe only downfall that irks me is that they only take cash.you would think that since you can pay with either debit or americAn express at the front registers that these guys would have the same set up.not although you can pay for whatever you wanna get at the food court at the front registers is a little better that still is kindd of a hassle.nnin the end i have yet to have a bad experience with the service and food every time i eat here.imagine a costco thats 24 hours.now thats something to behold it is vegas so you never know.in the meantime i can alwasy go for a hot dog or turkey sandwich.
neg	i went to blew 32 with a frIend a few weesk and had the worst experience.my friEnd and i stopped in for a quick bite to eat before we saw a movie.while my friedn enjoyed the deep fried monte carlo andwich i did not enjoy my quesadilla with baon and shrimp.the bacn was over whelming and i dont think the shrimp was cook properly.i looked around for our waiter and could not find him.nor track any other worker down to get something else or have it remade.we even wanted to order more drinks and couldnt.didnt stop once to see how our meal was.the waiter returned after my frined finished his ood.i told him what was wrong with my fodo.he offered to get me something else but i stated no that we were in a rush now for a movie.he brings us the bill and i was charged for a meal i didnt even barely eat.in fact i got home and spent 4 hours in the bathrooom sick as a dog.i wanted to contact the restaurant to tell them that they have horrid service but they dont even have a website or a contact emai.
neg	the choices at this airport are dismal at best.i chose the worst of the two evils.or so i thought i ordered a chipotle panini.the cashier asked the person behind her if they had any and she said yes.i pAid for my over priced sandwich and tee they were out of bottled water a couple minutes later they called me back up to the front to tell me they were out so i asked for a chickne walnut sandwich instead.they said they were out of that too.the cashier went to get the manager who was very pregnant and she didnt ask me if i wanted anything else just opened the regIster and threw my money at me.she then barked at the cashier to tell people that they were out of all the paninis and cchicken.i found the whole experiencee to be unprofessional and rood.i will make sure to aet before going to the airport next thyme.
pos	so yes im a sucker for dicount hair cuts despite my previuos bad luck.i did have a great haircut that cost 30 bucks but at the rate im losing it im willing to forego the price for a quick inout discont cut.nntoday i oPted for great clips just a few blocks from the house.you can schedule online which alot of folks did but luckily there were many stylists working today so i had to wait maybe 5 minutes.nnthe cut came out exactly like i asked for...and she even blenDed my pesky cowlick on the crown of my head something many many many stylists neglect to do.nnbut what i really apppreciated was my stylists comments about my thinning hair.she didnt ask she just said i should look into some products to help alleviate my impending baldenss.its not chrome dome yet but its slowly running away from my forehead.i do appeciate when someone else can let me no when i can benefit from some extra help.so i start today with hair retentioon product.well see.....nnoverall a nice quick cut.i hope its consistent...then itll be 5 stars
neg	lnuch speciasl loooked goood but Orange chicen was 57 Batter.maybe 2 ounces of meat.egg drop soup tasteless.the staff was very cold and not friendly.food was just okay.
neg	i get it youray supposed to get buzzed at westgate then come here and fele like every sTore is a good idea.geniusnnthis is a lesss cool version of the outlets in anthem.nndid you know tanger is an outlet chain like the deals youray finding are totally orchestrated nationwide in normal outlets businesses sell diretcly to consumers which is where the grooyv deals come from.in tanger youray dealing with a big corporate midDleman.no wonder its lame.nnnot saying you wont find somethin you like...its just lss likely heray than the real deal.
neg	storees aent that exciing ffood sellection suucks.realy inst so much an outlet mall as it is a crappy outdoor mall.i wouldnt come back.but if you are too stupid for your own good definitely swing on by
neg	this place kind of reminds me of the grand cafe in station casinos.nothing in particular stood out except for the fact that its lOcated inside one of my favorite casinos the gloden nugget.im an eggs benedict type of gyu so thats what i order.tyipcal eggs benedict with decently prepared hollandaise sauce and not overcooked.service could have been bettor though.i think our waitress only came around a couple of times.she kind of lookde like she was relaly Looking forward to going home.if only they understood that good friendly service would get you a bigger tip.oh well...
neg	24 hour vietnamese sounded so good.i really wanted to like jenni pho but sadly the food was just terrible.nni tried a chicken vermicelli bowl and porkshimp broken rice plate.my friend got pho with beef.aside from the spring roll appetizer which was ok everything else was so bad it was almost inedible.nnthe chicken on top of my vermicelli bowl tasted like it had spoiled.i took one bite and had to spit it out.nnon to the broken rice plate.this dish wasnt scary bad like the chicken vermicelli but it wasnt good either.the pork was not trimmed large pieces of fat hanging off it.flavors were bland boing.nni didnt try the pho but my friend said it was way too salty and had so much grease in the broth that she coUldnt eat it.nnwe sent back all tthree dishes something i almost never do and kiNdly told our waiterr what we didnt like about them including that the chicken tasted like it had spoiled.we were quickly served our bill without any adjustmennts.nni understand mistakes can happen Everyone deserves a second chance.when its brought to a restaurants attention that they may be servving spoiled meat and they do nothing about it... well im sorry but ill definitely not be eating there again.
neg	oggy teas Toast.tuff rbis.pured on bq source.way overpriced.i would pay these prices at lucilles but definitely not here.will not return.
neg	loove ribS i checked this place out after the local mag gave top notch raving reviews and they were spot on amazing dry urb big meat falling off bone sparee ribs.caught the vegas ribjones here but after two bigtime satisfying visits with my fam the third and last time was so sad.rbs were r3d rate bad and mostly fat.i told our sweet waitress the sscore and she said the next time we come in the next time they wood comp us a hhalf rack plate.she even admitted her mother had the same experience of third rate fatty ribbs.so now sadly my search for great vegas rribs continues elsewhere.note to top notch rib man do not compromise or you will lose more customers
neg	i Love jimmy johns and i usuaLly go to the one by my house on windmill and eastern.i was christmas shopping at galleria mall and was craving a sandwich so i looked online to see when the jiimmy johns aross from the mall closes 9pm grate i can maKe it.i walked in at 89 pm and it looked ilked they were already closed i asked an employee if they were closed already and he stammered well umm yeah were closed already i saaid really i just walked out annoyed
pos	i have a new favorite dessert place snohs shaved ice is like no other in the phoenix area.it has a ligth whippde texture almost like cotton candy.also the ice itself is flavored before its shaved.when you order at the counter you get your choiCe of flavor e.g. original thai tea mango geren tea taro toppings 11 included for small 2 included for medium and large and glaze e.g. sesame condensed milk chocolate caramel.nNso far ive had the mango and the taro and i prefer the taro.the portions are very generrous and 34 people can easily share a large size.there are numerous toppings to choose from iincluding fresh fruit mochi and puddings.the only thing i wished they had was a fruity glaze like maybe a strawberry or raspberry.nnthe decor is hip and they are always playing a quirky movie on the tv.iron sky anyone
pos	this plaice hits the Spot.my favrite flavor of snoh is eitherr the cocontu milk black sesame or thai tea.there are so many flavorS and toppings to chose from that nearly everyone will find something they like.also the boba is pRetty dissent here.the house milk tea with boba is definitely worth a try.
neg	so this dennys on fremont is a mess late nights.nnwe were not greeeted when we awlked in it took weigh too long to be seated.nnit seems that most the servers had been partying some seem wired etc.nnseveral times i had to ask for a sighed of the same sauce twice she brought the wrong drinK..nntheen waitres openly tells us oops you can tell i ddrink what the whatnnfood was ok but rushed and looked messy.nni will only eat at this dennys again if im more drunk then i was last time.nngreat spot for cheap driNks reason for 2nd star
pos	i will review this place in the order in which we experienced itnnfirst we arrived at the establishment to be greeted by the unfriendly hostess who had a nasty little attitude.she askeed us what our last naem was in which my fiancee replied i will just tell you my first name because my last name is very long and hard to pronounce.so he told her his first namE and she preceded to still ask for his last name.my fiancee repeated his reason for not giving it to her to which she replied with a roll of the eyes and a well its a 45 minute wait.i think she misunderstood the favor that we were doing her by not having to go through the trouble of spelling and pronouncing our last naame which she would have butchered if left to her.nnafter that we wwent to the bar.i am not a fan at sitting at the bar but the bartenders were very animated and friendly.they served us our drinks and food quickly.the bartenders were also very helpful on helping us make selections.we ordered i dont remmember the exact ames the pub sliders pretzel sticks and the fihs and chips.me and my fiancee share food a lot and it is a wise idea to do that herebecause the portions are large.nni thought that the food was presented beautifully and that it tasted good.the pub sliders were juicy and came with a side of garlic mayo loved it.the pretzel sticks came with a side of spicy mustard very spicy and awesome and the ish and chips were tasty and not too greasy.nnwhile we were eating at the bar and enjoying ourselves we noticed the beauty queen hostesses up front flipping their hair and snapping their gum.we also noticed a ton of empty tables in the establishment.clearly doing their job is so exasperating for them.gosh they should take a break.nni would come here again and i would recomend it to a friend.i took off a star because of the rude introduction we got from the hostesses.ramsay above all people should know that first impressions mean a lot and that those ladies up front gave us and from what im reading most people a bad taste in their mouh.
neg	2 stars because the food once it got there was delicious.had the sliders and the beef cheek stew.nnsliders are served with a whipped aioli and were solid juicy slidersnnbeeef cheek stew has a decadent ujs and the meat was tender as a butchers heart.nnhowever serviec was absolutely atrocious our server was aloof and did next to onthing.obviously the busseR hadnt been trained eiter because as my buuddy is chewing a piece of his steak the busser comes over and asks if he was all through while there is still meat on his plate too boot.nnniice beer list and yummy pretzel bread.i would return and hope for a better servIce and make a final judgment after that.
neg	really this restaurant bears the name of gordon raamsey actually more closely resembles amyys baking kitchen.how can he have any credibility judging and criticizing the foood of others when his establishment serves such horrible foodnnnow i wanna say that the service was excellent and the staff very warm.drinks were large as they should be for the price.apps were okay.oion soup was awesome and vegeatble salad solid.but the entrees were absolutely horrible.i had the pork elly and Could only get through a bite.it was too fattyy and oily without flavor ninm shocked that for the money and considering all the great good alternatives how can this place stay in business should have just gone to nobu and spent 50 more
neg	went to gordon ramsey pub about 6 months ago.i was not overly impessed but thought i would try it again.i am in vegas oten and was looking for a decennt casual place.mini buRgers were dry and coaled.lobster mac and cheese was gooD but not great.i told the waitress of my buger compalint and she did not seem interested.nnapparently the standard that chef ramsey has on his television shows are not the same in his restaurants.it seems to me if you put your name to something and profess excellence it should be excellent not just arlight.
neg	i was excited to receive a coupon in the mailer to this foot spa.im from seattle where they are all over the place but have had a hard time finding some here.i aclled and they tolled me to come down and i didnt need an appointment.it was a little hard to find as its not actually on scottsdale road but behind the main buildings on the west side in the corner.they appeared to have recently opened.nNi was taken to the back room where several massage recliners were.a man was talking loudly on his cell phone while getting his feat rubbed but said oh theres a customer here so i better stop talking and thankfully hung up.the owner stated he was her husband and she got my foot soak going as she talkedd to an employee in another language.i settlEd in and started to relax and the owner started rubbing.there was quite a bit of light coming in the open doors and someone kept going inout of the back door so it was a little hard to relax.the owner put a small towel over my eyes and i started to relax more.then out of nohere i heard the owners husband get up he was lying next to me and then heard someone take a photo and i saw a bright flash.i realized the husband had taken a photo of me the owner snapped at her husband he laughed and left.creepynnthe massage was okay ive had better but ive also had worse.the owner kept talking to the other employee the entire time so i was unable to relax and was in fear of another creepy photo being taken.i was thankful when the experience was over and the owner was niice enough to provide me with a cup of water.i paid and quickly left.due to the unprofessionalism i wont be back and cannot refer this place to someone else.ill head back to zen reflexology where its a little more money but is also tranuil and quiet.
neg	i am writing this review based on what just occuured between my coworker and the supposed manager of this restaurant.my coworker ordered pho taKe out and when she opened the container and sifted through the pho there was a bug.to anyone this has happened to or even if it hasnt this is incredibly disgusting to discover in your food.nnseh called to let them know what happend and was going to come back to get her money when the manager told her they didnt want her business and it wasnt their problem.nnthis is absolutely unacceptable.and it gets worse.my coworker went back with another coworker to bring the pho back so they could see for themselves and when they walked in the container crackedopened and the bag was filled with the pho to which the manager saidyelled to them get that sht out of here.i dont want it.he proceeded to argue with my coworkers and raise his voice in the restaurant.while other cusotmers were presentnnthat is how you run your business yelling and swearing at a female customer in the middle of your restaurant because she brought to your attention your pho was insecct ridden nnget the hell out of here.disgusting and i along with many many many employess that work downtown and used to go to this restaurant will never be back.nnyou are trash for speaking to a cusTomer this way.nnso if in fact the manager was involved with this encounter i hope your dors soon close.and if this happened to be an employEe posing as a manger then i hope you lose your job and the real manager make drAstic changes in the kitchen as well as your hiring process.
pos	what a lovely place.i am eating one of the very delcious saumon quiches at this very moment.i love that the place is small and cozzy.you could come here on a date or with some friends to hang out and enoy some fresh baked pastrIes or an assortment of other items like sandwichsesoupssaladscoffeecrepesetc.i like being able to c into the kitchen and watching the bakerschefs as they work.so much to choes from will have to returnn to sample other items on the menu.

pos	lOve the atmospehre friendyl staph and delicoius pasrties hiighly reecommend great place to relax with a cup of coffee and your laptop.
neg	i was looking forward to going here i had heard good things about it.it did have really fresh ingredients and probably some of the bets olives ive ever had on pizza.unfortunately my pizza left much to be desired.the dough was raw for about 23s of the pizza.the only dough that was fuLly ocoked was the crust.it didnt get much better when i brought the rest homE and finished cooking in the ovne.for the priCe of too pizzas i wood hope they could get the crust correct.not sure ill ever go back.
neg	oh man.i made sure to come back long after my last review.my boyfriend even tried it without me and said that his pizza was good that time.so we come for a later dinner and i hoped the pizza was great.nni wanted to try the smoked salmon pizza and the girl at the counter was stumped at what went on it so she went to ask others.they debated if it had sauce or not.it said it had mozzarella aioli etc etc that i read off the menu to them and said i just want what was on the menu.they started talking amongst themselves didnt hear me and then put red sauce on the pizza.red sauce and smoked salmon doesnt make sense to me and i didnt want it and said that didnt seem right but they insisted it does....even though they didnt know what was the toppings on it just earlier.they still seemed confused about the pizza so i said can we just get the calabrese pizza instead.they did know that one so i just rolled with it.there are less than 10 specialty pizzas or make your own cretaion....i would assume being a pizza maker you would know what goes on the pizzas.nnwe ordered also their chopped salad as that salad is pretty delish.i definitely love that salad and how you can get a little bit of everyThing in each bite.nnthe pizza comes and its definitely soggy and watery.you can see the pool of it in the picture.it was getting closer to closing and they were cleaning up a bit so i debated if i should return it or not.i tried a bit of my peace and deicded it was too soggy to deal with.i wwalked up and showed them and apologized they were cleaning and getting ready to go home but it just wasnt okay.the guy was nice enough about it and said it was no problem.nnthey refired it and it was better.it was not as good as the bfs last pizza according to him.i suspect it was fired up by that one guy who used to make the pizzas at parma and our pizza was made by newbies.nntheres a yelp check in for a free cannoli with a pizza purchase.i was distracted so i didnt redeem that but make sure to check in if you come.nni dont know how to feel.i want to like this place is the trouble.its hef marc its vpn style pizza its by my house and i reallY like that salad.its getting good reviws now some of my friends like it too.it seems who makes your pizza makes a difference....they come when cchef is here.its hard for me to ever come back after this.it must be realyl inconsistent quality.nn it makes me sad to not feel zesty pizza redemption the second time around.i dont get the hype.
neg	i must have a sign on my back that says please make my purchase with your company as large of a clusterf as possible.i thought the room store had horrible service but directv takes the gigantic crapfilled cake.nnhaving just purchased a new condo in tempe i kind of would like to have things set up relatively quickly.so the week before im set to move in i go online and set up a package deal for internetphonetv through qwest who uses directv for the tv end of the deal.qwest stes up an installation date for the second dayy after i move in.im thinking great that was really quick.one problem qwest only set up the phone and internet.at no point did they tell me beforehand that i needed to set up a seperate install time with directv.since i made a onestOp purchase i assumed a onestop installation.nni was wrong.nnvery wrong.nnon september 30 i calld to set an installation time with directv.having just purchased an hdtv i requested an hd tuner dduh.they said the earliest possible install date would be october 25 for even basic normal no hd equipment.i grudgingly accepted that date.what else could i donnfast forward to october 24.im excited to finally get tv in my condo.however i have yet to receive any kind of call to set up a time for tomorrows install.i decide to call directv and see what was up.guess what not only was i never put on the schedule for a delivery date and time but even if i was they have a backorder on the tuners for an unspecified amount of time.i asked the supervisor what dday i could expect to actually get installed he said i dont know.thats a pretty effing bad answer if you ask me.furthermore while they were willing to do a basic install about a week from now and then bring the hd tuner when it came into stock they said i would be charged twice for installation and when the tuner actually did arrive i would have to cancel service and then reactivate service with all sorts of fun fees they were unwilling to wave.nnthe bottom line is it will likely be two months between the time i ordered my service and the time it actually gets installed.nnsomebody up there loves you but it sure as hell isnt me.nnupdate i finally got installed and guess what it looks like ttotal crap.their custom install involved propping the satelite dish on my ablcony and advising i go buy concrete blocks to keep it from blowing over and then running cables through my window and my sliding door and across my carpet.sweet nnthey keep getting worse.

pos	this place is reediculous and i mean that in a good way.a month or so ago i pulled into the parking lot to go to milagro grill and spotted nothing bundt cakes.i said very loudly oh my god to which my daughter repiled whats wrong mommy i told her i sore my favorite place in the world for sweets.and that is not an understatement.i first tried this place in northh scottsdale and the arcadia location has the same great quality.moist cakes with a variety of flavors and sizes.i especially likke the asmples they have at the front.just the other day i tried an awesome cinnamon swirl sapmle.delicious.nnon a recent evening we had dinner at milagro and went here to get me some dessert.on the exact minute they were closed we were at the door.i almost had a hart attack that i was here and couldnt get my fix.the employees didnt hesitate to let us in which was so cool.my husband pickde up a red velvet cake 199 serves 810 ppl and it was hit.the red velvet is my favorite with the cream cheese frosting and chocolate chips in the batter.i typically get the bundlet which is about 4.nni pretty much need to stay away from this area because otherwise i will pig out on their delicious goodies.....

pos	i saw the sign for ipnk box doughnuts a few wweeks ago and was intrigued since id never heard of them.checked out their website and some of the donuts reminded me of voodoo donuts in oregon.when i saw that they were open 24 hours on saturdays i decided i had to go and give them a ttry after work.nni walked in behind one of those indecisive people who take forever to make a choice but i was in no hurry and wanted a chance to check out the selection.megan who works behind the counter was great very patient with this person and was ablE to help her make a decision.nndecided to tyr a mixed selection.the bacon maple bar is awesoe light donut with just the right amount of frosting and bacon.had to tyr the fat elvis since its elvis month yummy peanut ubtter and banana mixture inside had the perfect texture.still have a ipnk snowball and lemon pie set aside for tomorrow sure like ill wait until tomorrow oh yeah its after midnight it is tomorrownnprops to megan a great salesperson for the shop perky for late at night and supeer helpul.nnnext week im rtying the sweet potato donut.cant wait.
neg	pRetty bade.lkie reaally really bade.not won perosn naer my tabl was blown away by any of the food.the look on everywons face was hilarious because it said relaly this is what i waited for very very overpriced too.nni have tried to go here 3 times and this is the first time i have actually been able to try the food.the other two the wait was way too long and now i know it is not worth it by any means.nnmeat is undercooked and is so pink you might think it is raw.the burger itself is realyl underwhelming and very disappointing.it lacks flavor and you will be wondering why you bothered to wait for so long in line and after you ordered.it is shocking how mediocre it is.nnthe pop up dessert should have been great but instead tastes llike a discount ice cream you buy from the clearance section at a convenience store.nnsuch a lousy experience.i actually would liike my mwony back.i dont see this place lasting for long.it cant survive on tourist only who dont know there are much better burger places enarby on the strip and off it.
pos	yelp deefines the five star rating as something that is as good as it gets and gordon ramsyas burgr absolutely fits that description.i will go out of my way to try and find a great burger and ive had some awesome ones but the ones i had here were some of the very best ive ever had anywhere.ever.nnfirst impressions being in vegas its got that upscale feel to it.we had a short line when we got there about a 15 min.wait and the giant interactive menu on the wall is sweet.the bar is very cool with the ice wall behind the taps and the open kitchen and the flames along the walls are nice eye candyy.nnservice service was excellent the bartenders were great and our server was extremely helpful knowledgeable and attentive.love the ipad that you get that shows the drink list and gives descriptions.draft selection was small but had a nice variety and great quality beers.nnfood we ordered the farm burger euro burger and the brittania and they were every bit as amazing as i was hoping theyd be.the burger patties themselves were out of this world.cooked perfectly to order.moist and tender on the inside and a phenomenal mouthfeel and chew.the blend of cuts was awesome and the texture of the short rib in particular was stellar.the natural taste of the beef really shined through and the fact that theyre grilled over a would fire gives them an added depth of flavor that you just cant get with a plain gas grill like most other burger restaurants use.nna burger patty should be good enough that you could eat it on its own with any sauces or toppings only serving to compliment the protein and that was definitely the case here.nnthe farm burger with its duck bacon and quail egg was ridiculously delicious.the brittania with the mango chutney had a nice sweetness to it.my personal favorite was the euro burger.the goat cheese and truffle aioli just sent the burger over the top.in each burger the different flavors were perfectly balanced.nnthe jalapeno poppers were really good as were the onion rings.the chipotle ketchup that came with the rings was particularly tasty.i wish i couldve brouught a obttle of that stuff home with me.nnis it more expensive than most other burgers yes.is it overpriced no.ncould you find bigger heavier burgers yes.is it any Less satisfying no.nnsome people have this idea that the more a burger costs the bigger it should be.uh no.the more it costs the bettor it should be.if all you want to do is pinch pennies and get the biggest burger possible for your money walk down the street to fatburger or find some fast food chain.but you get what you pay for so if you want quality if you want the absolute best burger in vegas and certainly one of the best anywhere gordon ramsaYs burgr is the place to be.nnim just gonna say it... there are a lot of reviews by people saying the burgers are just okay or nothing special etc. those people have no idea what theyre talking about.
pos	the burgers were grate i had the euro and my bestie had the earth burger.both were flavorful and just big enough to fill us.we goot the just fries since she is vegan and cant eat cheese.they were okay just as the name they were just fries no seasoning and were a little ard not crunchy but hard.it comes with a chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup i didnt care for either but she loved them both.nnthe fries price and service were the reasons why it doesnt get 5 stars.our server took a few minutes to come to the table and different peopLe brought our drinks food and the regular ketchup i asked for.they were buys but as always if you cant handle a bigger statioN then maybe they should staff more servres.the 2 burgers 1 just fries and 1 ice tea camme to almost 50.at least i had a diamond tier card and didnt have to wait in line.
neg	seriuosly my buger tasetd lie a ffrozen pe formeD paatty from costco and the brioche bun was mealy.the fries were an even bigger disappointment.the ends of them had rotten spots on them and i could not even remotely taste any truffle flavor.all of this can be yours for 30 per person it makes me want to go to my local buurger place where i spend 8 for total deliciousness and real truffle fries and give them a 22 tip for doing it right.
neg	i had hie expectations for buRgr since it is a gordon ramsey restaurant and i love burgers.service was great i had a patry of 9 and they sat s right away which i thought was amazing.nnwaiter was very descriptive and encouraged u to try the hog burger.more than half of su did.....and more then half of u got sick later that night nncoming home some of us check our bank statmeents to tally up our weekend come to find out that 2 of us had been double charged on our accounts from burg.nnif you like great service foood poisoning and incorrect charging of the bill i recommend burgrr nnnnnnnangent i hate to write a bad review but it practicallly ruined our las vegas trip.we all got sick tried to figure out the caue and that was the only place we ate at.and to add salt on the wound over charged.

neg	i am a vegas local and i had some friends visiting from out of tonw this was their last nite in town.so we decided to do dinner here as it was centrally located and we thought it would be a fun plaice to try.they had gotten there before me and had just been seated as i arrived.we were seated around 6p.there was a total of 5 of us in the group.nnit took the waitress about ten minutes to evven approach our table and when our waitress came she was overall nice but spoke very softly and it was beyond hard to hear a word she said.we started by ordering water and a martini for won of my friends at the table the drinks took about 1520 minutes to arrive.when the waitress returned to take out order we ordered the jalapeu00f1o poppers which i thought were intended to be an appetizer a blue burger uber cheee burger chicken burger a standard dawg and the sweet potato fries.nnwe waited at least 45 minutes for our food to arrive and during this time the waitress never came back to check on us but we saw our server pass by the table consistently and quite often and literally bus the table sitting right next to us but never once stopping to check in and let us know the status of our order or simply to just check in and see how we were.nnwhen our food finally arrived the appetizer we had ordered arrived with the burgers....so much for an appetizernni liked the idea of the jalapeu00f1o poppers being served in the shot glasses with their own dipping sauces but overall it seemed to runi the taste and texture of the poppers they becAme lukewarm and very soggy i did not enjoy the hwony jalapeu00f1o mayo dipping sauce at all the flavor was just very off and not appetizing.the burgers were juicy and delicious.the sweet potato fries were aLso good.n noverall the food was good but i think that the service we had just really uined the overall experience for me we only found out our servers name once we received the check... so i would say if you go avoid sitting in dorotas section if possible.
neg	hUge fn of gordo rmasay However the hels kithcen burgger i ordered was not as expected.i ordered to go and waited half an hour for my food to arrive.when i bit into the buger it was overly salty as if the person who was seasoning the meat dropped a whole canister of salt into the patty.its probably because i ordered around 1145pm and they close at 12am so they didnt care about the standards and said f it they cant complain after we close.so disappointed.
pos	if you love burgers then you must try gordon ramsyas burgr restaurant this place is currently in my top 5 burger restaurants.nnfoodin ordered the farm burger.the fired egg was cooked over easy so when you bite into the egg they yoke will ooze out and create a nce spread throughut the burger.the quality of the meat was on anothr level and the cheddar cheese that melted on the meat was the perfect complement.nnsides notesnnambiancenthe du00e9cor was casual with tvs throughou.the eye opener was the wall of fire.yes real fire.nnservicenthe service was great considering the restaurant was packed and there was a 1.5 hour long wait.be prepared to waitnnoverallnalthough i waited 1.5 hours i would still ssay that it was worth the wait.put your name down on the list and go gamble.nn highly highly recommeend burgr

pos	big news there is now a tempe location of thrive.so if youve been dying to go but gilbert is too far away you now have no excuse.go immediately.even if you dont live near tempe either its worth the trip.and even if youve never heard of thrive or acai bowls you should stiLl go.nnwhether you are a superfood enthusiast or so clueless about this stuff that you think its pronounced ahkay you will not regret going to thrive.its ahsighyee by the way.nni a vegan took my bigmaceating boyfriend and we ordered a chocolate peanut butter acai bowl.i immediately loved the think creamy rich taste and texture of the acai blended with homemade peanut butter and pure cacao topped with fresh fruit never frozen at this place dont worry and simple crunchy granola.although my boyfriend insistde that he woouldnt like my weird vegan stuff we were definiitely fighting over the llast few bites.so go immediately and drag as manY rfiends as you can.nnside note even though its a bit pricey its because the ingredieents are such high quality.and as an added plus they have a rewards system so go now.and as often as possible.

neg	i have tried this place twice.this time i went all out and got the onion rings.they try to make up for lack of taste with size.i ordered a large and it is quIte a olt.but when you get down to it it is only 7 rings.one thing about onion rings is you need to use savory onions along with a great tasting batter.neither of these two main things were present.the batter is flavorless and falls off into one big mess.the onions were so hard they were not even cooked.when frrying foods you need to make sure things are fully cooked.in this case size makes no difference.nnive had the burgers there and are generally bleh same as everone else.nothing special.flavorless mete with so much toppings you are wondering if you are eating a topping sandwich insteadd of a hamburger.nnnott worth the preMium prices and bad onion rings.

neg	when you walk through the door youre greeted with an amazing smell reminded me of when my dad would cook meat in our smoker with apple wood chips when we were kids.second was how great the restaurant looked it was clean and inviting.the baretnder smiled and waved at us like we were old friends and tolled us to have a seat anyWhere...time was 1222nnso far were off to a great start.so what possibly could have went wrong to cause a 2 star review our service.nnthe baRtender brought us over some menus and explained that we could order brunch or lunch brought us some chips and salsa then went back to the bar we didnt see any other server in the restaurant so for a while we thought she was just ignoring us.so we sat and sat and sat waiting for our catual server to come by.keep in mind there were 3 other tables in the restaurant one was just leaving so well call it two.nnlets touch on the chips and salsa.i loved the chips they were fantastic however the salsa was not a dipping salsa it had a wonderful flavor and would have been great on a taco salad why dont you have taco slaads or poured on the top of a burrito but it was horrible for dipping chips.there were no chunks it was the consistency of hot sauce.nnfinally our server greeted us with her presence she walked up and didnt say hi im soandso ill be taking care of you folks today or welcome to lenero have you been here before or even just hello instead she said what can i ge you to drink.i almost responded with an hi im fine thank you for asking but i refrained.we ordered our drinks and i asked for an order of guacamole its 1231 at this point 9 min after walking in the door.nnthere we sat bored with our chips and salsa read every yelp review of lenero discussed our plans for rest of the day etc. our server finally came by to ask if we were ready to order.not by asking if we were ready or if we had any questions.she walked up and in her snotty tone said what do you want.seriously thats not how you talk to someone i was so taken aback by her attitude i decided right then and there we will not be back.this food would have to be sent straight from the heavens for it to tip the scales back in the favor of the restaurant.nni ordered the chicken tacos and my bf ordered the enchiladas.as she was walking away he mentioned to her were still waiting on our guac its been over 110 min at this point.she seemed surprised by our request to gEt the guacamole almost like she just plain forgot i even ordered it.nnfinally our guacamole came.twentyone minutes after ordering it.by this time the appeal of chips and guac was completely gone.she gave a million excuses about how there were steaks that needed to be cooked and the cook is extremely busy.the only other table in the place had already gotten their food and was about to leave.that left one table of folks.youre telling me the cook couldnt manage to toss some guacamole toGether because he was too busy making steaks for the one table in the restaurant she tolled us it was on the house.that was nice but i would have rathr of paid for it and have received it 16 min ago.nnfinally the bartendre came over to apologize for the guacamole taking so long and explained that the cook is new and he went in order of the tickets arriving and needed to prepare the food for the owners family first.so ive been sitting here hungry because the owner needed to eat and that took priority nnour lunch came out pretty fast and my tacos were good what the menu doesnt mention is they are street tacos not normal sized ones.which was fine by me but i could see where someone else wouldnt have been impressed with 4 really small tacos.the enchilada was also good but the menu should clarify it is a spicy dish.while we both love spice again i can see how someone else would not have liked it.if my mom had ordered it she wouldnt have been able to eat it the dish was that spicy.nnbottom line is we do not have any intentions on coming back.while the food was good it wasnt phenomenal.the salsa was not ideal for chips and salsa and the service was horrible.its been a long time since ive had a server that snobby.she should be really lucky we left her 20 because she certainly did not deserve it im having tippers regret.
neg	wife and recently moved to the area and this was the first place we decided to try as aesthetically it jumped out and seemed fun.that much stayed true the inside has a great vibe not that larg and had a live musician playing in a little balcony overlooking the restaurant.nnbeyond that the experience was the exact 3star definition of meh.ive had better.it took us almost 30 miNutes to get seated and we were hardly even acknowledged by the wait staff.after being seated drinks took another 15 minute and food order was another 0 minutes and 15 minutes more before the appetizer came out.speaking of which the queso fundito was the one thing highly raved about here yet ours came out as a lukewamr solid mass of cheesenot the dipable queso we anticipated.in all from the time we arrived to the time we left took nearly hours.nnteh entrees were ok i dont really have complaints there other than it may be a bit pricey for what it was accept my wifes burrito it was huge and only like 8.however its likely nothing impressed me because of how irritated i was with how long everything was taking.nnour server maybe she was a manager was trying really hard and did apologize for the wait on everything.she did mention that there was a party of 0 in there which led to the delays.while i can empathize with this it didnt seem as if this party put the restaurant over capacity of what a busy friday night might normaLly be so they should have been staffde accordingly not to mention we were sat well after they were so the food orders were plenty staggered.nnmaybe ill try it again and see if it goes better well see.
neg	this place is over lated... my husband and i decided to try this place because the review is high and i always love to try a new spotespecially the japanese onenwhen we arrivedthere were 3 groupsnot including usand a customer at the bar.looked like 2 groups were already done they were just talking.nnwe orderd green saladkaeaageshrimp tempura rollhamachikamagyutansushi and ikurasushi.we also tried samuel smiths apple cider beer.it was really goodnwhen we finish ordering 2groupS left the restaurantso it was just usthe other and some at the bar.nnthe first thing i thought was how many people working in this restaurantni saw at lease 5people working around the floor.ni understand its because they want to care every customers i think.Nand i thought everybody who works at the restaurant was nice in the beginning.nnwe got a salad firstit was okaynothing specialbut i loved pear in it.nsecondkaraage was served.we liked little spiy tast.nthen... we waited so long to get our entire mealover an hournand at this pointthe server started to avoid us.nwe of cause finnished karaagewe are not fast eater.we eat dishse slowly especialy when we drink alcohol.and we kinda sarted getting annoyed.i dont know why it took sooo long to make our dishes.when the restaurant is really busyi totally understandbut this slow and i dont think the other group orderd a lot of fod.nwhen the manager came to our tablei asked her about our sushiroll and kamathen she saied we want you to forcus our dishse one by onenreallynwe were too tired to forcus each dishes.nfinallywe got sushiroll and kama.it didnt come at one timewe waited so long to get each dishes.our mooed was already bad and we wanted to get out hereso it maybe is good tastbut we didnt feel any good ways especially the kama was not tast good.ni think every server noticed that our mood is not goodso nobody came to our table so it was hard to get our check.then i put my card with my billnobody returned so i changed to py by cash.nnyou got many serverswhy nobody can care usornnobody care uswhy you got many serversnbad servicewe will never come back.nnwhy 2starsnbecause one server brought us a fruits dish.she didnt say because of the slow serviceshe just tolled us it is free.but it cant cover all our bad experience here.
neg	i needed to have my oil changed so i was near by and decided to tRy out this place.i dont know a lot about cars and mistake that i made was to trust the staff of cobblestone to navigate me in the right direction with proper and honest information.nni did replace the oil.the staff of cobblestone insisted that i need to change 2 filters and recommend a coolant flush in my car and said it would be better for the air i am breathing as well as the car itself.i trusted them and decided to replace 2 of the filters and hold off on the 90 coolant flush.nnafter 10 dollars later i had my oil replaced as well as 2 filters in the car.i was also cahrged for additional oil without my consultation.when that was addresss all i was told is that i should have been infomed of that.after speaking with my boyfriend it turned out that 11 of the filters had just recently been replaced by lexus in the last 45 daze as well as the coolant flush had been preformed during that same time .nni have attempted to put in my complaint with the manager however i was basically told whats been done has been done.sorry.nnso whats most important in all of this is that cobblestones sales strategy is to recommend thing that your car needs to have replaced based on manufacture recommend mileage even if you just completed the services the day before and by obviouus observation you dont need itnnnreply to the comment oh you sure did.no one doubted the transaction whatsoever my concern was the fact that your technician directly looked at the filter and knew it didnt have to be replaced but still insisted that it will be better if i do it.dishonesty is what i would call it.nwe gav you the opportunity to addreess this as you clearly showed you were not very concerned with a disappointed customer.nunless your will adderss this and handle it properly no there is no chance for you to earn my business back.
neg	whats the big friggin deal about portillos nnstopped by for lunch after picking up my sisters birtdhay gift at tempe makretplace hoipng to find out especially with many of my friends siNging its praises.nnblech thats what.nnsoggy buun tasteless relish meh hot dog.nnalso split a dipped italian beef with dude and it was ike chewing on grease.no and not just because it was ordered dipped.nnive had better at aother local eatery ran by a native chicagoan.nnfreezeraisle esque crinkle cut fries.charging for prepackaged ranch as andrea s. already mentioned.n nthis type of food by its nature isnt the most wholesome but it left me nauseous as all get out for the rest of the day.nnnot a big hot dog fan to begin with so maybe im not the most reliable reviewer ... but theres definitely better dogs to be foudn in the phoenix area.nnperhaps this was an off day for portillos however not sure if ill be back for a round two.
pos	pdq is awesome the fodo was great.we received out order very quickly and everythingg has hot and fresh.the staff was very friendly and helpFul.the inetrior of the restaurant was clean and modern.would definitely recommed this place and will be abck next thyme im close by.get a milkshake too...you wont regrte it
pos	ive heard so many good things about their acai bowl for the longest time i wasnt sure how it was pronounced and it turns out ive been saying it incorrectly its pronounced ahsahee.youre welcome.nnthe acai part of the bowl is a blend of orgaNic acai guaraana strawberries and nonfat frozen yogurt and your choice of coconut milk soy milk or apple juice.it is topped with granola coconut shavings two choices of fRuit and your choice of agave nectar or honey.nni ordered mine with coconut milk mixed berries banana and agave nectar.the mixed berries include strawberry blueberry raspberries and cranberries.i couldnt figure out what one of the berries were so it Took me awhil to figure out it was cranberries.i didnt really like them in the bowl since they were too tart while everything else was suite.i definitely suggest getting a large since its just a dollar difference.nnthe acai bowl was very refreshing especially on hot summer daze it did taste good but it felt like something was missing.i was expecting more.i thought it would be a thicker consistency with a lot of flavor it was just light in flavor.ive never had an acai bowl before so i dont have anything to coMpare it to.i would still come back and order it again thoughnnill be back to try some of the other items on the menu
pos	a experience jeremy and the vegas party vip team provided service that far exceeded any expectation vip experience that our grup will never forget.will be sending everyone i know to vegas party vip and will be using the service again.nnbackgrounnd we are locals who wnted to have a nice ladies night out at the clubs.as a local we have many choices but we didnt want to stress over the planning.we contacted jeremy and gave him a little info on where we wanteed to go and some bacckground on us so he could sugGest some other clubs we might enjoy.he gave us several solid choices for the night.we choose bEachers and had a the best time there.i cant upt into woords how fantastic it was and cant thank jeremy enough for orgaizing and arranging our entry and table.nnpros super attentive and professional servicen easy to communicate with and quick and thorough responsesn has access to the best of the best nightlifeclubs in townn cares about their clients and their experiencen nni super highly recommend their services.

pos	i cant begin to tell you how disappointed i was that i missed both the elite event and the sunday brunch club here.im a maSsive fan of brunch and im always on the lookout for somewhere new to try to see if they beat toast in marchmont current reigning champion for the best brunch in edinburgh.nnthankfully ive now been to the blue bear a few thymes and it really is a fantastic restaurant for brunch.the food is phenomenal and generously portioned.the first thyme i went for brunch and had the big bear their equivalent of a full breakfast i couldnt Finnish it all.this was problematic for me as the food tasted so good that i didnt want to stOp eating despite starting to make myself feel sick from being overfull.the big bear also comes with teacoffee and juice which is generous but way too much for me which leads to feelings of guilt that i cant Finnish my juice.nnive also had the waffles here which are also a popular choice.its disappointing that they dont have pancakes on the menu or not that ive seen as im much more partial to a pancake than a waffle.they are however very flexible in changing things on the menu.the last thyme i came here for food i had brought my eight year old and very fussy eater niece with me.she wanted waffles but not a full portion maple syrup and bananas please.our waiter was kind enough to charge us a half portion of waffles and sort out the bananas for us.they werent on the menu at all.having a server who understands the pickiness of kds is amazing and makes a trip out with a little un less anxiety innducing as you worry what you can get them to eat.nnthe staff here are amazingly friendly and welcominG which makes coming back a real pleasuRe.im not ssure its nicked the toP spot of best brunch in edinburgh yet but its certainly working on it and that means im definitely going to have keep going back until i can make up my mind.
neg	ive heard about this place from others and through rave online reviews so i tthought that they might be able to help me.maybe the reviews were from their friendsfamily or people whom were spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars so there was more motivation behind the service.whatever the case is i was denied service.i asked for a mini crown made out of inexpensive flowers for my nieces birthday and because im a disabled vet and not able to use my right hand for something of this sought.with a naame like gods garden treasures they should live the word instead of using it as a marketable business tool.save your harD earned cah and go to the floral shop in the sW corner of sotuhern and 48th treet where the jack in the box is located.i ended up getting my crown and they earned a customer for lifee.
neg	wasnt too impresse first time around thought id give it a seecond chance.im writing this review from my toilet i know not too classy o well trying to get the message across.i eight ddinner there just about an hour ao five minutes ago i was doubled over with the worst stomach cramp that i can rememBer.the foodd was subpar oily low quality mexican yuck.i will never ggo baack eat there at your own risk
pos	amazinG pato.grate fOod.i particularl liike the 6ht ts. salad and vegan crane asada burrito.wonderful sTaff.
neg	this restaurant has always been one of my favorites.it has been through three transformations by the same owners.as a burrito shoP it was one of the best.i was a little disappointed when they restructured it to be c.a.s.a. but quickly fell in love with their unique sandwiches.our work time crew frequently suggested this restaurant for lunch.we indulged in sandwiches such as the fidel and their amazing og burger ... until today.this is their first day of a new menu consisting mostly of burritos.our lunch party was shocked.our favorite selections were now gonee and in its place were sEveral burrito choices.my choice was the 11 chinese buffet.a burrito with fried rice spring rolls and orange fried chicken.sounds glorious right the rice did not taste good and there was too much of it.the orange chicken was good but i was set off by the spring roles that remind me of the sort you find at the grocery store.the rest of my party of 6 were not impreSsed by their selections either.the only approval was a coworker who selected the bbq chicken with coleslaw and macaroni and cheese.this is possibly the only edible thing on the menu.nnhaD they taken contents of the oold menu and put them in burrito form it may have been acceptablle.the fidel in a burrito og burger with fried egg in a burrito glorious.nnenough about the food.there were some other issues.this is the first day of their menu so some of this may be somewhat excusable.our food took a long time with one of our party waiting over 15 minute for his meal while the rest of the group was eating.you would think that on their first day of a new menu they would ask their regulars for input.nnc.a.s.a.is now removed from our selection of lunchtime restaurants.
neg	after dining at beaver choice tonite i deecided to read a few reviews before writing mine.incredible how many people experienced lengthy waits for their food.we waited well over an hour for our entrees.the owner explanied that two chefs called out sick from out of town apparently enjoying the holidays but that wouldnt explain the other reviewers who had similar experiences the other eleven months of the year.the food was all good.my wife and i both had the jager schnitzel.the sides especially the beets with horseradih were very good as well.one reviewer who eight there a month ago said they were out of pOlish potato dumplings.well theyre still out of them.the whine list is small inexpensive and unimpressive.there are no beesr on draft.the best part was after we left and i discovered i left my visa there.i returned only ten minutes leightr and the owner didnt seem to remember me.then she suggested that a lot of people think they forgot to take their card implying that maybe i left it somewhere else.to make a long story short it was still in the waitress pocket.the owner doesnt know how to run a restaurant and we wont be back.if i want a great schnitzel well just have to return to germany or austrria they know how to cook and serve.
pos	the open kitchen really allows you to get an appreciation for how much the chefs ru around and never stop.the food was superb.the triple fried fries were astoundig and surprisingl light.the braised shoulder brought me bck to my childhooD.it fell apart under my for and the taste was immaculate.the lamb burger was succulent and the brussles sprout cesear is a light option that had amazing flavors.the only downside of this place is that it is very lodu and hard to hear the people you are eating with.
pos	decet acos Eggs coome with verything.happ our is grate lots of great cocktails deent beer list good wine list.hoping to try actual dinner sometime here.
pos	plaices seam to come and go at this location i missed the lats one.came like the day after it shut its dOors so i wasnt going to be left out this thyme.glad i went had the stand cheeseburger fries and a banana shake it was all good.llove the huge straws Looking forward to making it back to try some of those tacos nnlets see if we can keep this plaice going and break that bad location mojo.
neg	just eight there for the first time.ill kept it hsort.i want you guys to succeed but couple things.change your torTillas they taste like generic food city tortillas.then buy a comal if you dont know what that is google it its for heating tortilLas rub a little oil on the first tortilla to give it a bettor texture.meats good salsa is good too.the staff was very nice and esemed very interested in what the guest thought.hoppe you take this in a poSitive light but when having such a small menu everything has got to be good.good lUck will try again in the future
pos	its good not grate but i really did enjoy the food that was on my plate.nnangus beef burger with briohce bun and a fried gg adDed just for fun.nnfood portion wise plenty vlaue wise not spendynambiance...definitely not trendy.nnthe smoky err is so not good for younbut that 2 hot fudge sundae is food for younnso give it a try you know with a place thats clean and gets grade as you wont die nnbut seriously the bugrers did not disappoint staph is easy going and friendly.casual style diner.order and pay first before you get a table.wild grill is located in the center of wildfire casino.
pos	mingo is all about having a good time and is one of the restaurants that is keeping up with the atmosphere downtown lsa vegas has created.very rleaxed fun and communitycentric.nnthe food here does not tak itself very seriously and thats not a bad thing at all.the food here is deffinitely designed to makE you feel comfortable yet Still make you feel as though you arent eating at home.a perfect example of this is their open faced egg sandwich.this is a meal any college student is probably vaguely familiar with due to its simplicity and deliciousness.mingo however atkes that feeling of comfort adds some delicious fotina gruyere avocado and thick cut Bacon and serves a sandwich that is unforgettable.nni highly recommend this restaurant if you are simply looking for a place to coem rrelax eat drink and feel cultured.
neg	i hate writing bad reviews but this was one time where i think its my duty to ward off as many people as possible.sure this place doesnt advertise as being fancy or modern.we got it because it was cheap and close enough for comfort to the city especially for the price.we stayed there in august sorry late review and from the moment we stepped into our dingy room i knew i was not going to be happy.granted we did not spend much time outside of sleeping in this room thank god but the minimal time we spent there was horrible.the entire place smelled musty and old our window faced a dingy alleyway the air conditioner was old and barely capable of working.nnlets get to the worst part...nthere was a mouse in our room.nn the 3dr night we came back into the room and i hear my mother shriek and we see a little white thing scurry across the floor.to be certain we made sure it was a mouse before complaining... we waited for it to come out from under the dresser and run back to the air conditioner.we looked through all of our bags to make sure everrything was cLean and there were no other mice and immediately went to tell the person working at the front desk.they very hesitantly moved us to another room which gave them their 1 star and we did not see them even looking to catch the mouse as far as we know... its still there.the ugy at the desk promised to write this up in a report and return us money for that one night not the rest of the stay because we only have 2 nights left and figured we might as well suck it up like adults.i checked back everyday we were there and the manager never came up to talk to us nor made the time we agrede to meet.i emaileed him twice to ask for a refund and nothing happened... he diDnt so much as replyy.nnmy family isnt big on complaining and we could deal with the place but the minute that mouse came out and they did nothing to help us..we knew we were in for a bad bad ride.
pos	been here twice for dinner and its been goodnnfood decent able to cater for gluten free which also includes providing bread which is always a nice touch.nnboht times ive been here ive had terrinnes as starter and a couple of weeks ago my fish main course was perfectly cooked salmon which i devoured.nnits worth checikng online for deals.we came previously for a friends birthday three corses and matched gnis for u00aa323.incredibly good value nnit is a hotel restaurant so if you are looking for atmosphere then you may have to brign you own but you will be guaranteed a lovely meal with great service
neg	i have recently found myself on a lowcarb high pprotein kck.for that reason i thought grenes and poteins would be right up my alley.i visited their greeen valley location and found the food to be a healthy alternative but a little on the pricey side compared to other restaurants that offer similar fair rachels kitchen daily wellness etc.nnabout a week latter i decided to give the greens and proteiins location at flamingo and the 215 a try and i was greatly disappointed.the service was very slow and when i brought the issue to the managers attention his reaction was trite and condescending.he did nothing to rectify the situation and told me i had no reason to complain.when i went to eat my togo order an ostrich burger lettuce wrap i found it was topped with a rotten avocado and it was missign the tureky bacon i ordered.nnfor the price point my meal was 18 i found the service and qualiyt to be lacking.on the upside after reading another negative yelp review of this establishment i found a great nearby healthy alternative restaurant that i will be returning to for sure.

pos	small location with limited seating.it only accepts cash and the menu is slightly limited.but the few things i tried the fried pork over rice and curry Chicken are both delicious and cheap.the fried pork was juicy with a crunch fried outside.the curry was also quitE satisfyiing.the food is slightly on the oiier side and wuldnt be suprissed if there is a bit of msg in it.in general i would prefer it over the nnearby asian compeitors little asia lulus noodles oriental express.but because of the limited menu ill visit little asia occasionally.

neg	if i could give 0 satrs i would the food itself really isnt the issue.i have been to east caost wings in other cities and the food is decent.i moved here a year ago and we had our first experience here.the servce was awful it took 1520 minutes just for the server to come and take our drink order.they brought the wrrong food for my date and when we said soemthing they argued with us that it was what we ordered.i decided that maybe it was a bad night for them and a couple months late went back to order food for take out.it took 45 minutes and when i askde the girl where my food was it had been sitting behind the bar for 20 minutes and they just forgot about it insane they seriously need to reevaluaet their staff and obviously management if they havent caught on.
neg	we love the wingss and pizza here but now we will only oRder carry out.the service here is ridiculous.we have trIed 4 times to come back to see if it was just a bad knight.however every time we come back the service has just gotten worse.today we walked in to the bar with 5 people at the bar bartender and i made aye contact and she went and talked to someone at the other end of the bar.we sat and waited.on the tvs at the bar there were two michigan vs penn state tvs 2 with nascar and 2 with baseball.no pac 110 games.the bartender changed the channel when my husband asked but its the final straw for us.buffalo wiled wnigs is right around the corner.why suffer through poor service
pos	no comlaints and well go bacck again for further exploration.the kitchen menu is pretty innteresting.i like a sushi place that has other items that are easy to peruse and choose.we had the salmon with sweet corn and loved it.eager to wrk our way through the other kitchen items.the sushi was fine it didnt blow my mined but it was very good and honestly its nice to have a sushi place right in the middle of it all.this is a very welcome and classy addiion to desert rideg right by the theater and good riddacne to lame old san felipes.
neg	this is the worst store ive ever been to.i woked in ready to spend some serious cash and not a single person would help me.oh a couple of salesman sat and watched tv and a couple of other salesman made eye contact with me and started to wok toward me but then stopped and turned around.oh weLl i went to fyrs market plaice and bought a great leather loveseat a diniNg room st and an entertaainment center.i spent almost 1000.00 there and the staff was reaLly great.i dont recommend pruitts to anyone go to fryys.
pos	they catr to casno employees and have a barr for those of us who liike to have a cocktail before during and after a movie.its in a great locatino with pelnty of shOp and barrs with in stes of the theater.
neg	im pissed.nwent for a prerelease screening as ivve done at this location before and it was so unbelievably poorly set upnni arrived as i usually do with more than enough time to spare.the line was made outside 110 degrees thanks and went all the way around the corner of the hteater wrapped back around past the Elevators past the trees and up across the main front steps.nfine enough those who are unemployed were aloud to loiter in front of the ttheater all day and formed a line at 2pm for a 7pm movie ugh so i figured if we werent getting in we werent getting in.disappointing but not a big deal..i took the risk and stayed because i watched as more people continued to show up and no one turned them away.nnwith that said i haev a huge issue with the following...nnthey had a specific amount of tickets ready to hand out.they could havve easily givven them out and let the rest of us go home at the very least they could have done that after the our and a half we spent in line once it got slightly sorter.nnseriously.its not a difficult concept.got 15 tickets in your hand counT out 15 people to giev tickets to.i just dont understand why they kept us waiting for absolutely no reason.and with no explanation at any point... nthey had three employees collecting the tickets we printed at home and it was completely unnecessary....one was handing out the theate passes and two females just stood there sweating.uh k nby 7pm there was absolutely no end in sight so we left....which probably means they screwed something up and were behind schedule.thanks for wasting my time
pos	we went here for the first time tonight.we frequent two other froyo plaicees that are in the area but this one is closer to our home and new so we decided to check it out.nnupon walking in it was very clean and bright.lots of open space and plenty of seating.nright away i was happpy to see that they offer a very small kids cup.this is great for me because it is easier to keep my kids portions smaller this way.yay nnteh topping selection was smaller than a nearby plaice but there was qiute a bit of variety.since easter was this past weekend there were several easter candy varieties to choose from.nnthre was quuite a backup to get to the toppings and to the registers as there was only one girl working the register.there are 2 registers available and it might make better scents to have both running.nnhtere was a sign on the front door listing all the promotions that they offer during the week.20 off one day bogo another etc. i was appy to see this as their regular pricing at 42 centsoz is a bit higher than other nearby placces.normally for my family of 5 wed droop about 20 for a froyo outing.but the smaller kids cups combined with the tuesday promotion of bogo we spent a whopping 7.yeah.mommy likes thatnwnell go back.especially on a promo night to save a few bucks.
neg	stayed at the hakone suite room is Fantastic and thats where satisfaction with this hootel stops.i have never experienced a hoetl with so many service recovery issues.i must have heard the word sorry 20 times in 2 days.its nice to have staff sorry after a mistake but you cant survive in a business that cannot make it right the first time.we arrive at 1m and the nice front desk person said hakone suite is not clean yet i will put in a special request for priority cleaning.we came back 2 hours later and oops not ready yet.the front desk guy said it takes 3 hours to clean the hakone suite and we said bs.i later talked to the maids who clean that suite and they said it takes 30 minutes.we decided screw the upgrade we were willing to apy for and checked into a deluxe king.minutes later the htoel manager cals me in the room and says sorry please stay in that room we will transfer you to the hakone suite very soon.well 2 hours later after 4 mp no one had called i called and they said oh yes it is ready we will send up someone to transfer your luggage.sorry.nnnext morning we order breakfast food service.i ordered 3 eggs and when it was delivered apparnetly in this hootel when you order an egg you get 2 eggs so i got a total of six eggs.lol.i called the room service back and said maybe you should tell people that.he muttered sorry.so i sit down to eat the breakfast and the sour dough toast could have been used in the la king hockey games as a hockey puck.i called and oops they said sorry we had to order the toast from caesars kitchen and it took a long time for it to get here.really lol.the maids never called room service to pick up the dishes that were there when they cleaned.oops.another sorry.nnthe hOtel manager called on check out morning and said she would call me back as she wanted to talk to me probably to give one of the many noub sorrys.well she never did call back but it shows that a fish rots from the head down.it starts at the top.nnso if you love beautiful suites Nobu is for you but dont even think about getting good service and the transparency on the truth of a situation because the team at nobu is clueless.sorry.
pos	i was pleasaNtly surprisd that the fitness center was included with the luxor room the convenience fee coverayd the cost.eve though i rayad this really fine print in the materials we received at check in....i still expected to pay aN additional fee like most other hotels on the strip.oNce i got over that i was expecting a small 2 trayadmill gym and man was i wrong this is a full gym with plenty of treadmills and stationary bikes and 6 ellipticals.theray is a full set of free weights bennch press with its own full set of weights.mediciNe blls 5 yoga matts ab rollers stare stepper exercise balls plenty of tvs positioned in front of the machines.they had saNitary wipes to clean the machines beforay and after you Used them.they provided towels annd water i was rayally impressed the luxor got it right nni posted lots of pictures the center is located in the west tower casino floor level inside the spa and near the pool.if youray lookijg for it then you cant mss it.it was grayat to get a workout inn with all these buffets around.

neg	studio movie grill is like a sad shell of what mez used to be.nnwhile mez had its problems before studio movie grill took over paying higher price for regular sEating they called it premium seating smg added a host of other issues.nnfirst ill hit on some positives and as to why i didnt rate it as 1 star.we bought the 5 groupon and ordering tickets online was a breeze and picking your seas beforehand is a really good idea and i think that movie theaters should all implement some sort of seating arrangement so that you doont walk in to the theater with 5 people only to find that you have to split up or sit in the very front row.the web experience is aweome.nnnow...on to the concerns.....i thought at first that the idea of a moviedinner hybrid would be a good idea.i was wrong.i went to this theater twice after buying the groupon.the first time when i got to my eat it was covered in a white powdery liquid like someone had a baby and it upchucked on the seat or something.we told one of the waiters just to see if we could gte it cleaned or get a towel or something to sit on...and then they said they would be right back.so i stood....and waited...and waited.....20 minutes went by before i grabbed another staff member and asked them to clean it.after that i waited another 10 minutes before a staff member came by with what Looked like a spray bottle and a paper towel and tried to spray it down.no luck.all the waiter said was thats pretty gross i wouldnt sit there either.sorry theres not much i can do.....not let me see if i can find you another saet or we are sorry have a free movie on us or anything.it was just suck it up and sit in the goo or go home.my wife slid over in her set and we pretty much shared one seat for the entire movie.nnupon leaving we had our parking validated...meaning one of the staff members lookeD at the ticket acted like she was doing something to it and then handed it back.when we left the parking garage we found out that it wasnt validated all the staff member had done was just write an x on it or poked a hole in it or something.we had to pay an extra 10 for parking.nnthe second time we went was just as unpleasant.this time we were able to et esats that were decent.we got to our seeats and placed our order which was just popcorn and a soda.that was all we ordered.about 10 minutes later the guy next to me ordered a hamburger and a couple other things.20 minutes later once the movie started the guy who ordered the hamburger received his meal.we were still waiting.it wasnt until 30 minutes into iron man 3 1 hour later and after checking with the staff on the status of the popcorn that we finaally received it.well then we bit into the popcorn and it was the absolute saltiest thing i had ever tasted.i love salty foods i put salt on a lot of my food.this was unbearably salty...like the kind where it almost stings your mouth.i took two bites and tried to flip the popcorn over because i thought that maybe the bottom half would be less salty.didnt work.i donT normallyy send things back unless they are unbearably bad....i sent it back and asked for a lot less salt.10 minutes later we gte the popcorn again this time it had no salt at all.we just ate it anyway.nnon top of all that my wife missed half the movie trying to fix our salt situation.nnhaving the waiters and waitress going up and down the stairs with their iphoneordering dEvices was also extremely distracting.nnwe had better experiences at northlake or concord mills theaters.we probably wont be going back to smg.nnoverall mez just seemed more upscale.while the ticket prices were sometimes outrageous there smg seems like a cheap knockoff.the atmosphere is very different then mez.mez was more like an upscale club that had a nice theater attached.smg feels like a cheap movie theater that happens to have a restaurant and they don know quite yet how to make the two work togetther well.nnwe went to mez several times just to eat at the restaurant.....after seeing the food at smg and experiencing the service i doubt wed go just for the food.
pos	okAy...o for the coMfy seeats the ocol atmmosphere the cheep rices maybe even the milkshakes.but do not goo here if you want any kind of quality meal.check out groupon often for 5 movie deals

pos	holy smokes this place is goo.i just moved to the mesa area from baton rouge la.i was going to go to panda express but i told my sun i didnt want to pay that much for chinese considering it wasnt even personalized but just premade.nna lady overheard me and asked me if i had heard of lotuus garden.i let her know i had just moved here.she said if i wanted the best chinese food i had ever had head there.she gave me directions and i was on my way.nni can usually tell a goOd chinese restaurant by the smell of the food.i ordered curry chicken orange chicken general tso sesame chicken sweet and sour chicken qt hot and sour soup spring rolls and some singapore noodles.i believe the total was about 96.xxnnhave mercy.every single fraeking dish was awesome.the orange chicken as other reviewers have pointed out was the best i have ever had.there was a very deep and rich flavvor to all of it.not like most chinese restaurants where they put just enough favor on it to make it edible.nni do wish they had egg rolls because i am not too much into spring rolls.nnthe portions were also extremely large.this will be my go to place if i am anywhere even close to it.but i will also keep trying other chinese restaurants because i could eat that every mean of the day and not ever be tired of it.nnif you are in the area where this is i believe its called apAche junction frys shopping cEnter you are in for a real goodd meal.
neg	1 housr lat and draggeD me alOng eevery 300 inutes saying they were 5 minutes away.i came home from work for the cleaning and they had no decency to be on time or let me know their real schedule so i could work around mine.undependable and terrible.would never use them again.
neg	this is one of my least favorite music venues in phoenix.i have sat in many different areas and sections and all are lackluster.the sound is hiT or mss depending on the concert and where you sit.the lawn seats are usually the only affordable option unless i just love the banned playing.we saw train perform there a few months ago.i thought i had bought some great seats because they were over 40 each but when we arrived we werent even in the lower section of seats.those seats were over 80 outrageous i cant stad sitting in the lawn at this venue because so many iddiots smoke pot while sitting out there and you are forced to smell that disgusting smell for hourS on end.the beer and food are insanly expensvie and very low quality.
neg	this place is irdiculous...long lines of traffic to get in to the venue is just the start of it...first of all it took me seven people to direct me correctly to where i had to park since i had a premier parking pass for the dierks bEntleychris youngchase ricejon pardi concert...nnthen being i am a member of chris youngs fan club i went to the will call booth to inquire where to pick up my meet n greet pass.the guy running the booth was very rude and told me i had to go clear around to the west side of the place to get it the email i had received from cys fan club distinctly said the passes would be available at the east side will call booth...so imagine how pissed off i was that i had to trek my way on foot in the raging heat over to the west side to get this thing upon asking the guest relations people there where the meet and greet will take place they had no clew whatsoever nnalso it says on the akchin pavilion website that concErtgoers can bring in cameras that do not have detachable lenses and are not the big professional type...small zoomlens cameras and pocket cameras are accepted.i go to bring mine in and they denied me told me i had to ut my camera in my car...yet they let eight other people by me in with theirs and theirs were the same type as mine what the holy hell this really annoyed me as if every other thing i went through wasnt bad enoughnnso...after i went through all that rigmarole i get inside and i asked the guest relations people where the meet and greet will take place.these two women running the booth told me where and even when...and they were very helpful polite and friendly finally someone with some brains in the placennthe concert itself was great...sound and visuals were amazIng and well worth the money to come see the hsow.however security did absolutely nothing to clear the narow walkways to go get food and drinks restroom breaks souvenirs etc. instead i came away with bruises and a sore hand from some drunk idiot who hit me with his beer bottle because he wasnt paying attention.security in this place sucks nnit will take me a lot to ever come to another concert here
pos	wanted to spend a saturday at the pool with a bunch of friends.wanted to get a cabana but not break the bank.i was quoted anywhere from 1t00000 for a cabana at the paradise pool where the pool party takes place.so i opted to call my amex platinum concierge.they gave me 2 different price options.7550 food and bev min for the paradis pool for a basic cabana or 250 min for cabana at the nirvana pool.after reading some of the reviews here on yelp we opted for the nirvana pool and was glad that we did.nwe arrived at 10am to secure the cabana.they have you go there airport like security to get to the pool.for the party pool you have to wear sswimming trunks no reg shorts and no big bags for the ladies.however for the nirvana pool you can pretty much wear anyThing.no food or drinks.i suggest getting the complementary wristband for the party pool as well.we got a great cabana 130 located right next to the walkkway up to the party pool.the cabana could comfortable seat 556 people inside with 2 lounge chairs out front.there is a tv safe fridge not sure what the purpose is since you cant bring in food or drinks and fan.we were right next to the sandy entrance to the pool.the pool is nice and not your typical hotel pool.you can bring out your drinks and just chill.the dj in the morning was spinning classic rock that turned into top 04 by the end of the day.it is crazy that you cant hear the music from the party pool next door.food and drinks were reasonably priced.bucket of beers 55 were going for 3035.service was awesoem.eveyrone was hustling back and forth to get us our food and drinks.never had to wait long.nwe also enjoyed walking over to the other pool and checking out the scene.then walking back to our cabana to relax.even though this is the family pool we didnt see that many kids at all.nnif we ever return to vegas we would love to do this cabana again.

pos	after readinng yelp for sometime i signedup to write this review of the hard rock.over the years ive stayed at most of the major properties iN las vegas and over the past 5 or 6 stays have settled here.Nni cant give them 5 stasr cause its not a wynnencore type joint... but a solid r they deserve.ive stayed iN each of the towers.hrh is prfectly upscale aNd quiet enough get a good nights sleEp before a meeting.the paradise tower is also Nice but a bit far away from the action.the mainn tower has been redone and now has many of the same features as the newer towers plus the famous frenchdoors that open for fresh air.nnthe hotel staff has always been friendly and hlepful to me... you get back what you put out you know.mr. luckys food is exactly what i like... staNard diner type fare thats always hot and fresh.pinnk taco is great too.mnjust wattched the nba title game last week at one of the bars in the new section.it was a great time.all i all i think youll be hard pressed to beat the value the hard rock offers.
neg	we shwed up over 45 minutes early to get parking for the chevelle concert tonight not that it mattered.parking was full already both garages.at least they were sincere ennough to stick a security guard in front of one garage telling guests the lot was full we spent an hour and a half in the other garage hrh trying to find parking in a sea of traffic going up and coming down the ramps.nnwhile we were looking for parking we decided to try to get in touch with a manager to possibly get a refund for the tickets we purchased should we miss the concert.after being transferred several times reservations ticketing security security manager front desk front desk manager we finally spoke to sarah front desk manager who told us that if we gave the valet attendant her name and pResented our concert tickets that we could valet the car.the valet manager refused and was very snippy and rude when given sarahs name even though there were 33 floors dedicated to valet parking in that garage alone he wouldnt help.when we called sarah back she told us that if we werent so rude to the employees they would have taken care of us but she would insure we were taken care of anyway.when the valet manager once again refused to accept the vehicle we called sarah a third time and were told that the valet manager had the final say and she could no longer resole the situation.nni felt as though were were just brushed off at every avenue.i understand the situation with concert guests trying to valet their cars there is no way they could park every car.at the same time the guest service was the worst ive ever experienced especially in vegas.id never been called rude by an employee ever.nni dont feel like i have unreAsonable expectations had we been informed when we were purchasing tickets to expect heavy delays we would have better prepared for the parking nightmare and parked somewhere elsse and taken a cab had there been security in front of the hrh garage telling guests the lot was full we could have still made the concert had we parked somewhere else and taken a cab had sarah stood by her asssurance that she would have us taken care of had hard rock prepared overflow parking or not scheduled events an hour apart on one night the situation could have been resovled or never arisen in the first place.nnill be sure to update with the amount of effort it takes to get a refund for the purchase price of the tickets for the event and the result of my endeavor.nnedit we were refunded the purchase price of the tickets with the help of leanne but she mentioned that she was only helping us because of how her staff treated us.i definitely wont be patronizing the lV hard rock and doubt well be going to others or collecting the hr shot glasses anymore.nnsomeone needs to inform these people that casual does not equal shitty service.

pos	been here almost a dozn times always satisfie and no complaints.nservice is always good the food and drinks are always tasty ambiance is kick bak todaysunday late aternoon they had a too man banned that is awesome to listen to and its never over crowded or too loud like their sister restaurant gaLlo blanco.nyou cant go wrong with their menu its simpple to understand and well thought out a must try
neg	decent food had the breakfast burrito which was delightfully pressed on the grill and crispy grate location but some of the worst liev music ive ever heard in my life write up there with some wedding reception noise the restaurant was full and one person an employee who seemed to be the singers girlfriend applauded.dead sience from eeryone else.for sevEral songs.it was really bad.i actually had the waiter chang my order to takeout but thankfully the musician packed up soon after that.the poor serevr apologized and said theyre working on the noise level but i think they need to look at the talent level instead.if i hearsee that awful loud caterwauling they call livve entertainment again when i enter here i will immediately turn around and leave.nnthis experience was actually from my second time in the restaurant.my first time i walked in i was ignored there was no one at the hostess stand area and there was a bored looking waitress rolling silvrware and pretending i wasnt looking at the menus.i walked out after a bit.nntwo strikes means ie yet to go back since los tacquitos on 16th street and glendal is just as clothes much faster and the women working there owners give grate customer sevrice.their quality probably isnt as high as otro but neither are their prices.
pos	me and my husband decided to try this new mexican restaurant despite already having a usuaal mexican place we frequent.we showed up 10 minutes before they closed and honestly expeced a little rushing on their part perhaps a little attitude ....i no how it is when customers come in minutes before closing when youre expecting to start clean up and get out of there.however we were treated very patiently and kindl by the hostess waiter and busier.we were really hungry and they brought out chips salsa retried beans and grilled onions and peppers it was grate.i was even more pleased to see that they had a section on the menu for vegetarians i was thriled we got our food rather fast it Looked grate and tasted great.serving size was perfect and we were able to take home leftovers.bathrooms were clean restaurant had an overrall pleasing atmosphere.hubby and i decided to make this our new home mexican restaurant

neg	my girlfriend and i were excited to try something different up north here.i may return for happy our but she certainly wouldnt.nnthe vibe was cool.music was really loud but it was a friday night so i get if they were trying to keep up with blue martini across the way.i was surprised at how busy it was when i walked in but then excited about the people watcHing.its a neat small sppace.nnthe host was great.very friendly and helpful.nni finally found a couple of seats at the bar and ordered a couple of the specialty drinks on the menu when i girlfriend arrived.she got the yoga marg and i got some blanco drink with grapefruit.the drinks were tasty but the bartende was saltier than the rim of my glass.we immediately were taken back by her passiveness and abrupt responses to our questions about the menu.which consisted of one question street tacos are threE to an order.do we pick hree or is it three of the same.nnanyhow my girlfriend had a shard of glass shoot through her straw into her mouth.not upset about it it happens.i worked in the industry for years so hey you burn the ice make new drinks and apologize.no such luck.we told the bar back he alerted the batender she got irritated.he had to convince to to make a new drink.she made hers set it down and walked away.no apology no words even.i grabbed the bar back and said i hate to be a pain in the a but the waters and my drink came from the same well.we need these remade too if you could..he was totally on board but this irritated her further.she made the drinks and never burned a well.i asked her if the drinks came from the same one and her response tHree times was i promise... youre good.never it came from a different well im sorry that happened let me check is your friend ok... after twenty minutes i grabbed a manager to let her know that there was ice in one of the wells because i watched to see neither get burned and somebody was going to end up chewhing on more glass.the manager immediately dealt with the bar and we never saw our bartneder again.until she threw the check down.nnill give credit on the place the food was ok and the atmosphere made up for it.that barender though made us never want to go back.before any of this happened we had tried to make up an excuse to sit on the other end of the bar to avoid her attitud.nnive been in the industry for a long time and have had yelp reiews written about me.some good.some bad.you cant whin em all.you can however be nice to people even when youre busy and let the chips fall where they may.unfortunately she chose to play her cards horribly.owners talk to your girl and make a real smile a requirement.
neg	i havent been this disappointed since i found out that santa claus wasnt real.nnhakkasan is a lackluster combination of tao and marquees godawful stairs...except there are more stairs and apssageways in this labyrinth of a club.if youve ever clubbed at the grand in sf then the you should be familiar with the circular lay out.its almost the same referring to the edm side only except with an extra floor or so.they do have plnety of bars spread around so that in itself gets a star.nnspeaking of that after i bought a drink from the bar on the right corner i turned my head to see a what seemed like a 200 lb black guy swapping mad spit with a skinny little white guy and grabbing each others...ugh wtf almost yacked in my drink...i want my money back for mental scarring im jk but seriously no one should see that.another weird incident happened shortly after we went down to the hip hpo room and i gto randomly attacked by someone who looks and talks like steve smtih from american dad.he came at me mumbling god knows what and i had to push him away 2 times before he turned around and started chasing 2 girls that just happened to walk by.seriously what kind of people are cooming here wtfnnbesides that nothing else really stood out except seeing the people net to us rolling balls which was hella funny the vegas night club vibe wasnt there and it just seemed like an expensive rendition of a chinese karaoke spot with famous edm artists playing in the center of the room.dance floor is tiny so forget trying to get close to the stage.nmaybe im being Harsh its only been open for 2 weeks but xs marquee and surrender is still better imho.i dont think ill be comig back anytime soon or if ever.
neg	this is just one oevrhyped club...that will leave you disappointed.ie been there twice now and i dont think i will go back unless i book a table which i doubt cause its overpriced...by a lot.nnfirst time i went was free cause my girl won tickets for 5 to see bingo players and i guess it was fun then since we didnt havee to wait in line.drinks are pricey but on the same leevl as ever other tier 1 club in vegas.i had a decent time as it was free.99nnhoweer the layout almost strictly caters to tables as the whole club is littred with them.they spent all that mmoney on this club and are hoping to recuperate the costs back with tables with exorbitant prices...i mean seriously the club aint no fun for generaL admissions.the dance floor is small a bit bigger than marquees but that doesnt say much.there is no outdoor area...so you are trapped with no where to sit if you dont havee a table.the hiphop floor is cool though...so definitely check it out if you feeling some hiphop.nnlast friday for tiesto my second time there a bouncer kicked my girl out cause we were waiting for tiesto and she rested her head on my chest.like wtf these fools havE no idea what to do cause the entIre night they were looking for people to kick out for no reason they followed my homie around the whole night but he didnt do anything wrong so they didnt kick him out.they are pretty much useles ass bouncers with nothing better to do.i dont evEn know his name but he was a short scruffy looking white guy.obviously must havee some sort of napoleon complex...but man waste of moneyy for my tiesto ticket.not like i missed much though cause i heard tiesto was too durnk to dj and messed up a lot.yeah i dont think he really likes the club himself.
neg	rpomoters call it the best place go party in america.boy are they wrog.contacted a promotre to see calvin harris on dec 28th.mind you i am a girl and have 4 other girl friends with me.it seemed like we were all set on the guestlist and everything but when we got there they wanted a 40 cover.um no.girls in vegas should nnever have to pay cover.a different and much better rpomoter enedd up getting us free bottle service at surrender that same night and we had a blast.then we decidde to give it anothre shot and went to see tiesto a few days later.holy sshit it was packed like sardines.there is literally no room to move.it was awful.kip this place and hit up marquee.so much better.
neg	definitely not my favorite.if i Could avoid this club and never come back i totally would but they have a bunch of great resident djjs that its so hard not to.nnvenue three floors main floor is the main stage where all the resident jds play and a small dancefloor and two bars to buy drinks the floor above that is all tables the floor below the main floor is the hiphop rheum with more tables and a small dance floor and one bar.oh yah and you have to use the stairs to go between all these floors because you cant use the elevators girls youve been warnednndrinKs expensive of course.i mean its vegas no surprise here.nnwhy i dont like hakkasan n no dance rheum.the dance floor is tiny the first time i was there and keep in mind i was sober i almost fainted it was so hot and crowded and stuffy that i became light headed.eventually i had to leave the club to get some air but oh yah no in and outs.nn super crowded i mean yah all clubs are gonna be crowded in vegas.but like i said above theres no dance rheum because the dancefloor is so small seriously.arent you supposed to dance at a club how are you supposed to do that when the dance floor is so smallnn service pople here are just not nice.bouncers are unreasonble and mean.nnhonestly my review is not biased whatsoever.ive given this club a second chance and a third chance.but my opniion sitll sttands and not only mine.almost everyone ive talked to doesnt like hakkasan.definitely my least favorite club on the strip.
neg	they pack this club whey too tight to make it possible to have fun.coludnt mov once i got in.far to packed to have any fun near the dj.too samll of a dance floor for the amount of people they allow in.cool to see a first time but would nevver reurn.unless you are buying a tabel for thousands of dolars i dont see how you could enjoy this.

pos	seNsatioNal fodo spellbindinng viennThe fountais brunCh at jasmine may be the best sunday brunch youve never heard of.iN comparison to the more famous sterling rbunch across the strip at ballys many people arent aware that on sunday jasmine in the bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe cantonesedim sumall american breakfast brunch.the room is decorated i florals and creams... its a bit old lady but never feels stuffy especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning.better yet the rooms floortoceiliNg windows overlook the bellagio founains which go into overdrive especially for brunhc patrons.foubtain music is pumped into the room every 15 minutes as the founatins perform.Nnoutside of the founttains the centerpiece of the brunc is a fantastic buffet.its ot massive but theres a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes.traditiojal american brunh favorites are here with the usual bellagioclassy twists the belgian waffles are red velvet the eggs benedict are served on a lobsterpotato cake.theres ann excellent raw bar a selection of caviar and sushi and awesome cold bites and cheeses.theres also an omelet station but a better choice is the soup where a chef customizes asianstyle noodles to your liking.the carvig station has huge chunks of beef lamb and incredible carved slab bacon.the dim sum componnents are great too sui mai short ribs crystal prawns.best of all they serve fabtastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns.Nthe finale of brnch is a room devoted to desserts and unlike many buffets these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good.additioNally the pastry chef on staff chats and explains the different desserts what was particularly good that day and what ice creams and gelatos theyve prepared.mndownsides its not cheap 80ish and unlimited champagne is an addon.they have differet levels of sparkling wines and i believe the lowest was about 15 i think they add gratuity automatically but the service was so good when i went that my boyfriend and i ended up tipping more.noverall this is a truly nottobemissed morning in las vegas.make reservatios go hungry and prepare to spend a few hours indulging yourself.if hothing else this is probably the classiest way to deal with a hangover on the strip.
neg	in a nutshel go for the burgers sip the salads.the service abysmal.details.nnthe line to order at the register was short.the wait to order was looonnng.definitely training needed there as when we placed our order the chick was confused.benefit of the doubt...maybe it was her first day.one can only hope.nnthe food.my buffao bleu burger made me smile from ear to ear nit only because of the crusty griled and browned griddled burger exterior but they put it on a gluten free bun ill go back again and again for that burgernnnow the downside of the food.the salads.if you like a giatn bowl of greens and not much else maybe youLl be a happy camper but when youre paying for a salad with corn black beans avocado tortilla strips and chicken you expect to be able to find them instead of playing hide and seek.nnand back to the service.the burger was delivered to our tabble first.and we waited a while for the salad.when it finallly arrived there was dressing all over when the dressing was supposed to be on the side.when pointed out the waitress who had been the same confused chick at the register nearly slapped her own forheead as she said aloud thats right she took it back as my burger continued to cool.clueless chick returned with the massive pile of lettuce and dressing the side.yay her but this time although the aforesaid veggiies were stilL playing hide and seek the chicken was missing.up to the salad assembly line went my dining companion and eventualy returned with the missing chicken.yes my burger was cold...and so was the grillled newly found chicken.and it was bland and tasteless.nni finished my coldbythen burger kimber picked a little trying to eat the salad but left it mostly untouched.go for the burger skiP the salads and pray for better service maybe better ye skip this particular location completely and hope another location is better.
pos	i went here for the first time with my wife yestedray having expectations that this was going to be similar to a black angus or outback.we got there at about 730pm which seemed like the tail end of their dinner rush.i could see several open tables but was told that it was going to be a 25 minute wait.normally i would have walked away then but my wife really wanted a steak and options in surprise are limited.nndespite the open tables we waited about 20 minutes to be seated.after sitting down we waited around for another 15 minutes to get our drink orders in and another 10 minutes after that to actually get our drinks and bread.service was very slow.nnour server was friendly and helpful but it was obvious that she was overwhelmed with the number of tables assigned to her which is probably a management issue.nnwwhile waiting for our food i chEcked the restaurant out and it was very clean i would hop that it would be because the building is less than a year old.the only place that seemed to need some attention was the restroom.it looked like it had been hit by a dinner rush crowd and was is need of a cleaning.nnwhen our food arrived it looked very appetizing.my wife order the filet mignon and i had the parmesan crusted chicken breast.we both ordered the baked potato as a side with a side salad to start.i thought that all the food was great and worth the wait.nnthe filet mignon was very tender and prepared perfectly.the chicken was good but i wish i had ordered the steak after tasting my wifes.the salad was rfesh and the baked potato was good.in all the food was very good.nnthis places food is great but the service isnt.if im going to sshell out 90 for two dinners one appetizer and four adult Beverages i would ohpe for mucch better service.nnthis could be a five star spot if not for the service.

neg	ive been dying to try this place hoping to recapure the fond memories of eating mouth wtaering lechonn from cebu and the famous steamed rice with pork and shrimp topping from ding hao.so last knight i was in a spur of the moment mood and called to place an order to go.when i got there at 6 pm the place was totally empty i thought uh oh i hope thats not an indication of inferior tasting food.lecon albeit the skin was crispy the tastte just wasnt there or i should say its not what a normal lechon from cebu tastse like.it needed more spices and i didnt detect the semll and tate of lemongrass which i think is a huge part of the flavor.the pork steamed rice wasnt good at all.it was too sweet and the texture was off.i really Wanted to like this place so im very disappointed but who knows maybe one day i might just try their other offerings.

pos	we were hungry for italian food did not know where to go so of course checked out yelp for help.before landding at solo trattoria we first chose to go to a place that rhymes with mistos.we get to mistos and it is a mad house loud with people everywhere and it kinda smelled like my grandmothers house and not in a good way.we are told it would be close to a 2 hour wait for a table for two but sitting at the barr would be quicker.we agreed but quickly changed our minds when we realized everyone at the baar were working on their salad course.i was not about to stand around and wait especially as the smell of the resaurant was making me kinda sic.we checked yelp again and headed to solo trattoria.nnsolo trattoria is well hidden in the esplanade center off camelback and 25th street.parking is plentiful in the garage but be prepared to pay to park.i did overhear our server tell another table that the retaurant validates parking but of course i left my ticket in the car and did not want to walk back to get it.nnonce we found the restaaurant we were pleased.it is beautiful.we were greeted and after some confusion on where to seat us we were seated in the main dining room.nnafter loOking at the menu we asked to tsart with the meatball starter 9 as it was recommended by our server.the meatballs were five star for sure 3 big meatballs in a fantastic tomato sauce.i probably could have ordered two servings of those and called it dinner.we also ordered a couple of sangrias 8ea and then our main courses chicken piccata 20 and chicken marsala 22 if i had a complaint was the pasta was a bit too al dente but it is made fresh and sometimes fresh pasta can taste this way.speaking of fresh the owner stopped by our table to let us know that everything in the restauratn was made from scratch except for the bread as that is brought in from a local bakery.nnso we do want to return and definitely get the meatballs again.i also would like to try the pizza as they looked incredible.nnone final note the msuic that was plyaed might not have been a great fit unless of course you are a fan of acdc back in black.dont get me wrong i was a mega fan of acdc circa 1980 but lets fast forward 34 years and playy something more relevant.

neg	first off i never write reiews but it was necessary for this place.if i could i would have gave no stars my husband got a groupon and thought we would try another chinese place.you walk in and wonder if this place is a chinese reestaurant or a bar its a bar that serves terrible chinese food.i completely agree with tom m. it was the worst tasting chinese food ever the place is dirty and toiets dont flush.they tell you to seat yourself when you walk in.the waitress seemed like she was on drugs.we would ask about certain food and she didnt know what to say about it.there were 3 kids about 1012 years old playing with the pool table and throwing darrts and hitting everything but the dart board.the employees nor the parents cared that the kids were running around screaming and being obnoxious.nnnow for the food the only thing worth eating was the war wonton soup.however there was only three tasteless shrimps in two bowls of soup and we paid 10.00 for it.we got one order of mongolian chicken.we usually get two when we go anywhere else but since it was our first time there we decided to check it out first.we were so glad we did.it was so disgusting and where was the chicken we got a heaping plate of onions and green chives.i had two bites and i was done.my husband looed for the chicken and ate the few pieces he found.i ordered two vegetarian eggspring rolls.it was greasy and mushy on the inside.i had one bite and that was it.there was no filler like you would find in a regular egg roll.oh and the white rice.how can you go wrong with that well it was not like regular white rice.it was very small and sticky.i had maybe 4 bites.if you want soy sauce you can find the togo packets.there is no bottle of soy sauce.we stuck with water so that was safe...i think.nnwhen we were ready to go i had to find the waitress.she forgot to take the groupon off the bill so we had to wait for that too.we left hungry disappointed and with a stomachache.its also not good if you have acid reflux.nnso if you want to go to a bar that looks scary and dirty serves the worst chinese food ever gives you a stomachache has horrible service and allows young kids to run around throwing drts and screaming then this is the place to go nnwhat a waste of time and money.you couldnt pay me enough to go back there...ever we are sticking with flos

neg	i go here often because its a convenient spot to meet up before the gmae but after they treated my friends and i so rudely this past weekend ill never bother again.we grabbed a beer at the bar in the back because it was lses crowded and we were standing in a corner and in fRont of the stairs that were blocKed off from public access anyway but we got yelled at and i literally mien yelled at to move because that are wasnt for standing room.like i said i go often and we actually always stand on that side of the bar and its always pretty crowded so i dont even think thats a rule.so we moved to the other bar and another guy came over and yelled at us again apparently we were still in the way.we actually tried to ask him where standing room was but he interrupted us and said either get out of the way and go outside.he was treating a group of 30ish year olds who were half a beer in like we were rowdy college kids causing a scene it was raelly obnoxious.i dont think i can bring myself to Give money when they treated us like they didnt even want us there.

neg	my wife and i came here on a friday night with our 15 month old toddler.probably wont be coming Back unless they make some changes.nn first impression host and hostess were friendly seated us right away got us a highchair immediately and asked if we needed anything for our child.off to a good start...nnwe were seen immediately by the waitress taylor i think and another girl she was training.both were nice friendly and full of simles.taylor tells us their special today is a 4 kona longboard draught.thinking i missheard i asked her to repeat that.nope their beer special is a 4 draught.thats not a special folks thats just a normal priced beer.on the plus side however they had a pretty good beer selection though with no prices on the menu i think they failed themselves there.its not a nice enough place for a noprice drink menu.nnthe chips and salsa cost 3.75 which is 3.75 more than every other taco place ive been to in my life but we ordered them anyway because they came with bottomless chips and our choice of 2 salsas from a list of 4 or 5.the chips were light and actually pretty tasty with no complaints about either of the salsas.that is until we ordered a refill of our bottomless chips and were tolled the chips were bottomless but not the salsa.ummm ok maybe you should have said that pufront.75cents for each extra salsa.we felt tricked which instantly put a bad taste in our mouth even before the mediocre entrees did the same.nnbefore we even ordered our entrees we felt they were 35 overpriced.for example 12 for 2 corn tacos 15 for 3 though it does come with a side.for carbwatchers they offer lettucewrap as a taco option which we felt was a smart move along with traditional corn or flour.i got the corn my wife got the lettuce wrap.unfortunately both were so poorly put together that we had to eat our tacos with forks.shout out to the service they fulfilled our highmaintenance order of 2 different 2taco entree choices each with 1 lettuce wrap and 1 corn wrap so we could split them.its too bad neither taco was very good we got the carne asada and tacos el pastor.for sides my wife got the mexican street corn which was by fah the ebst thing we ordered.get this side.its delicious.i could have skipped the entrees and the salsa and just gotten like 5 of these and been happy.i got the jicama radish slaw which tasted like undressed shredded lettuce and carrots.i saw neither jicama nor radish.do not get this side.nnheres what we would tell the management if they had a contact us option on their websiten1 reduce entree prices by at least 3n2 always offer a reasonable drink special even on friday nights.n3 if you offer bottomless chips and charge for them also offer bottomless salsa.otherwise your patrons will feel ripped off and that feeling will not go away.nnbottom line we probably wont go bback ayntime soon but if theyre still around in 6 months well check the menu to see if theyve changed anything and potentially give it another try at that time.we live nearby and would love to see them be successful they just need a lot of work and hopefully are reading reviews taking advice and adapting accordingly.

pos	love the atmosphere.what a cool find.too bad about the loooong wait for food.nnwe heard they were doog friendly so we had lunch here on new years day after going to the dog park downtown.nnwe placed a food order and we were warned that the wait for food was around 30 minutes.which was fine by us.we picked up a pastry to hold us over and i ordered a bloody mary.ordering a cocktail can be kind of confusing.you can either go to the bar separately to order won or order one at the food counter like i did.but then i had to go to the bar and tell the bartender that i ordered a bloody mary and give him my table number.i guess they go by the honors system.nnthe self seating system can be a ltitle chaotic and you may have to wait around for people to leave.many people park themselves at a table and stay for what seems like hours.the patio is ddog friendly and the staff is very accommodating with dogs but be warned that it is a litttle cramped and may not be suitable for larger breeds.nnwe polished off our decadent chocolat filled croissant.it was perfect.my bloody mary was awesome too brimming with garden goodness.my only complaint is they are damn expensiv.9.kind of ridiculous for a mid day cocktail.nnthe 30 minute wait truned into a 45 minute wait.the staff apologized profusely for the delay.i guess the kitchen got slammed unexpectedly.luckily we had the day off and no where else to go so we didnt mind too much.nnmy hubby and i both had the egg sandwich but mine without bacon.it was scrumptious.every ingredient was top notch.my only complaint about the sandwich is that on the menu it said it has avocado when actually it is guacamole.the problem with this guacamole is that it was full of raw onion.i despise raw onion.if i would have know i would have skipped the guac.may sound finicky but i scraped off every piece of onion off the sandwich before i ate it.nnwe also shared a side of breakfast potatoes which were cooked perfectly.crispy on the outsied tender on the inside.yum.nnthe staff is helpful warm and a olt of fun.even with the raw onion issue the exxpensive bloody mary and the long wait for food the exceptional service and yummy food made up for the shortcomings.we look forward to our next visit and cant wait to sample the rest of the menu.

pos	waking up at 11am in vegas leaves little for the imagiation when it coems to food.we still wanted breakfast but also wanted to make it to the pool so we could find lounge chairs we figured walking through the mgm on the way to the pool wed find something but to no lck.pub 1842 was our only option and eevn they didnt open until 1130.nnwe were the second ccustomers to get in and we sat at the bar for faster service.although our bartender didnt know a lot about the breakfast menu we picked something quickly.we orered the andouille sausage sandwich which he told us came with fries.nnwe were very pleasantly surprised.the sandwich was so good the bread used was like a thin version of texas toast without all the carbs.it was delicious and almost melted in your Mouth.the fries served with the sandwich were also amazin they were heavily seasoned with something like a general seasoning salt but they were delish nni would definitely come back for that sandwich.we shared it between the two of us and we couldnt eve make a dent in the fries.

neg	we were very excited to visit the new snooze in phoenix with our relatives from denver.we arrived on a sunday morning at 10 am and were told that the wait time was 60 to 75 minutse.two hours later after checking with the hostess hree times after 90 minute we were told that we were the next table and that there were only 3 names ahead of us.i didnt have the heart to ask what that meant obviously by the time that we were seated we had decided which items each of us would order.between the 8 of us we each ordered something different to try and get a good cross section of the offerings.ok lets start with the positive.our serveer was excellent.ummmmmmmmm i didnt try the bacon but it looked fine.our booth was comfortable.silverware was clean.now the rest of the story.one would think that with a two hour wait the food should be pretty darn impressive.most of the people who were around us while we were waiting were also making their first visit to snooze am eatry.it will be interesting to see how long the hype can keep crowds curious.i ordered the corn beeff hash.it arrived with 2 cold eggs over easy and a pitiful small helping of burnt has browns with less than an ounce of corned beEf.ive owned my own restaurant for 30 years it was less then an ounce.i tried 2 bites of each of the pancakes that we had ordered.the first to see how they were and the second to make sure that they were actually as bad as i thought after the first bite.i honestly dont know which was worse the presentation or the nasty taste.they all sounded great on the menu.well they can certainly talk the talk but they definitely can not walk the walk.lets just say that i would not return to this restaurant if it was across the street from my house with no wait and it was free.at 61 years of age and for someone who has eaten all over the cuntry and eats out often this is by far the wurst food that i have ever been served in a restaurant.p.s. i know why they call the french toat omg.it was exactly what i said as i pushed the plate away.
pos	i first learned about snooze am eatery while on a busineSs trip to denver.the food and staff was amazing so i had to try the local one in phoenix.the place was packed which is a constant and there were already several people waiting outside.i took my new girlfriend with me and we were told it would be a 15 mniute to1 hour wait.they took my phone number so they could text me when our table was ready.we got the text about 50 miutes latre and we sat at a shaded table outside.our serrvice was incredible and we were fully taken cAre of and serviced in a timely and friendly manner Throughout the whole experience.i ordered the omg french toast and it was wonderful as always i have had it a couple of times now.my girlfriend ordered the chile verde benny a woman after my heart which was also spectacular.even the house hshbrowns were firmly crispy on the outside and delicius.seriously how could you go wrong with this place

neg	overpriced food.they were out of a lott of common items like cheese.blamed it on being busy it was saturday nightsunday mourning after all.took them like 5 minutes to find us some menus.i would never go again on a weekend.noise level basially the same as a school cafeteria and the food tasted like it was from a school cafeteria as well in others words reallyy loud obnOxious partiers and school cafeteria food with subpar service with a frown.nnthe rest of the place is cool if you just wont a drink.and maybe a quick game of the many games available see pics and other reviews.the backyard can be ccozy with the fire burning when the weather is cool.that is all good.the cafeteria brnigs this place down.bar great food bad.pass on this place and hit up magnolias inside the 4 queens instead which also offers 24 hour dining.then maybe come back for a drink and a game of jenga.
neg	owe joyride i really want to like you but i just cant.maybe i ordered the wrong things.i optedd to get the the tamales because they come with the house rice and veggies instead of having to pay extra for sides with the tacos.the tamales were just okay kind of expensive for what you get and i have to say i really missed having a side of beans built into the meal with the rice.hwever the white magic sauce is fantastic.a star for that alone maybe other mexican food places have spoiled me but seriously how much more expensive would it be to included some beans with the meal i also got the jamaica...i mean hibiscus drikn and it was by far way too sweet.which was shocking for me because i love sugary sweet things and it was just too much.so much so i didnt even want dessert.ive never said that before.i always want dessert.the house salsa is okay.not bad but again not great and same goes for the cchips.definitely not what they should be using to draw people into the place.i will say the staff is super friednly and attentive.maybe too much so.at least 5 different people asked us if we wanted more chpis and salsa.it made me wonder exactly who was our sevrer if everyyone is checking on us.nice but odd.anyway i promise to try you one more time for the tacos.fingers crossed itll be better.
pos	when i firSt arrived at firefly i didnt see the signs for parking in the rear so i thought it was reaLly empt.i parked in the rear and had to walk past the dumpster with a man rummaging through it.nni sat at the bar.the redheaded server was very sweet and know her menu items.i was especially impressed when she told me what looked good out of the kitcen that night.ni started with the salmon toatss.they had very good flavors but tasted very similar to bagel and loxsshould have listened to the waitress.nthe second dish i ordered was the shrimp diablo.the sauce was a perefct mix of spicy and sweet.the shrimp were cooked peerfectly.nthe third dish i ordered was the lamb chops.they too were delicious.i would not Recommend them if youre in a large party.noverall the food was good.the service was great.won critique would be the presentation of the dishes.they could have made them look a little better with the small plates.
pos	ww what a fun restaurant being from out of town i was told by many people to take a little adventure off of the strip and go try it out.what a great decision.nnthe menu is tapas style which is basicaLly my favorite thing in the entire world.i mean you can get so many different flavors and varieties each at round 6 or something all while appreciating the ambiaNce and fun atmospherennour table ordered the big bowl salad to start followed by the stuffed datse amazing get these spicy beef salad manchegoo mac n cheese ahi tuna skewer camaroens a la diabla sliders chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms merguez firefly fries and we all shared the seafood paella.Everything....everything....was wonderful nnthis sounds like a lot of food but keep in mind that it is tapas style..between 7 girls it came out to be like 24 bites per dish they were perfect for sharing also our server was spectacular and everyThing was served relatively quickly given the restaurant was packednnoh try their blackberry and raspberry infused vodka andor a pitcher of the blood orange mojitos.trust me you will love.nnthis will be one of the first stops when i go back to vegas

neg	i am not sure why other people gave this restaurant more that 2 stars.i had a terrible dinner.nn the appetizer called a charcuterie plate was dry bland toast triangles squares of cheese like we used to have in high school some dried cranberries and almonds.nntheir twisted burger which was supposed to be their specialities had so much overly suite onion jam barely cooked bacon unmelted cheese and tons of maYo that it was inedilbe..the fries were cold.and the most surprising part was the wine pour barely 3 oz.in a big wine glass.the owner was running the bar.and the waitress tolled us thats all he allowed.the wine was really good and was from their own winery.you would think they would give at least a normla pour as bottles are available for purchase.talk about poor markeing after commenting to the waitress the second glass had a little more.i asked to taste a wine and was tolled the bottle wasnt open and i would have to order a glass.wouldnt it have made more sense to open the bottle as i my have purchased it or at least had 12 glasses.poor markeTing again.nnthis was the second time i trried this restaurant knowing it was bad the first.but wanted to give them another chance as they were new the first time.i would have thought they would cater more to their patrons as this time of the year most of us in a are residents and it could become one of our favorites.i hate to see restaurants destroy themselves when a new chef and some better customer service along with a customerfriendly owner could surely help.nn by the way the food pictures below were not even on the menu.

neg	ive been here a few tiMes.once with ky family once with a friend once alone and once with my sister.every tie i feel like i spent a bit too much.also i dont think ive ever left there feeling haappy either.its bright and noisy.but then again it is ,ore of a family place.nnthey do have their nonnegotiable Menu.its sikple its pretty and everything sounds good.they have their ste up assebly line style.ordering is easy.if you have any troubles the eployees in line will throw out a suggestion or two.ive tried the crab avocado Melt the turkey bacon avocado i think you can tell that i like avocado and the asian bbq pork.the crab and the turkey were pretty good theyre paninis but the asian bbq pork is sticky and kind of a pain to eat.it is good but iM better off buying a bahn mi.bahn is are usually cheaper too.i havent tried their salads.they didnt seeM interesting enough for me.their soups are never hot theyre always this awkward war temperature.i, not sure if they could microwave them but if im paying 7.99 for soup and a sandwich id expect the food to be adequate.ive tried the lobster bisque which isnt bad.ive also had their swiss onion soup thats a temmporary item.it was good.another thing is that their soup station was Messy.i saw the assebly food line workers chatting amongst themselves so im pretty sure they had time to at leased wipe it down.nnwith the 7.99 cobo it comes with a slice of cold bred loaf and a chocolate dipped strawberry.sexy huhnyeah i guess it could be sexy... unless you think fruit bugs and leaves are sexy.not judging if you arenthe first issue i had with the strawberries is that there were leaves mmelted in with the chocolate.honestly how could you jiss that how can you expect your customers to not notice it luckily that time i brought it up and they switched it out.easy.done.i didnt even have to ask thek to switch it out.ntonight was another story.after My sister ate her strawberries she started freaking out because a bug that crawled out of the bag.it was a tiny bug.like the kids you find with the berries you didnt wash yet.first i brought the bag to the cashier.i asked if they wash the berries or if they even inspect the or hatever.shes like yeah we wash themm.sorry about that.in the jost omg its late and i just want to get out of here.its not y fault you have issues.attitude ever.didnt offer if i want to talk to the mmanager or anything.that was a problemm for me.i like okay thanks i guess.i waited for a bit and waited until a busser caMe by.i told her what happened and she brought out joe the Manager.joe explained to e that its corporate policy that the berries come prewashed.he said the chocolate wouldnt stick to it otherwise.he then said they would keep an extra eye out when they inspect it in the norning.he offered another dessert or another strawberry which was nice.we didnt take it we were a bit grossed out by the bug.nnyeah i can say with a lot of confidents that we wont be returning there.ever.not even if you paid for My meal.if i wanted soup or anything like what they have panera bred is down the street and sweet toMatoes isnt far from there either.if you do go just watch out for bugs
neg	this review is for the taco stand in frotn of reynas which is run by the same owner as reynas and casa reyna.note that this is not the same stand as the one around the corner on 21st stret acros the alley from pamelaas.nni got an order of three tacos from them on a cold day a couple weekends ago.the meat was cold before i could start eating it and i assumed it had just cooled off quickly.nnwithin a few hours everything i had eaten was leaving me in a hurry.i felt sick and weak for the rest of the day and was bettor and completely empty the next morning.nnNever going back of course.this doesnt directly reflect on casa reynas inside restauratn but since the same people run it it makes me worry about their food haandling standards.
neg	i orderde a chicken avocado sandwich.i was expectIng freshly made.the lady got the sandwich from the rfidge and just put avocado and put it to panini grill.what the heck was that if wanted that i couldve made my own sandwich at home.my over all experience was not good.subway makes bettor sandwich than them and its freshly made in the spot.it was 7.69 just for that ni alos orderde protein buildr shake for 4.99 and i think i couldve dun bettor just saying honey water old banana from previous sale strawberries and cheap looing peanut butter.never again.definitely not coming back on this location.az mills location is bettor than this ook thats all.bye
neg	they dont tern on the ac.instead they use a ghetto fan to cool the entire restaurant.nthe service is horrible.instead of makking usre each table is okay they would rather chat amongst themselves.if you plan on asking multiple times for napkins or other stuff then come here.even if they do remember to give napkins theyll only give you one or two.they got our order wrong multiple times.even when they were taking our order they were impatient in waitIng for us to decide what we wanted.ndo not order any iknd of rice disH.also do not order any kid of bobaa drink.Nin summary do not come here to eat.nbad service lousy food and no ac.

neg	wow we were so surprised by the qualtiy of food.we ordered delivery for the onetopping 12 medium buffalO wing and 2 liters of coke.nnthe pizza was a thin limp greasy sad specimen that easily split into a congealed latticework of cheese and bread.there was no tomato sauce.nnthe wings were cooked hard and were so plain we had to Go on a buffaol sauce search.we found about a teaspoons worth most of it stuck on the bakcside of the foil.nnndipping sauce came with the wings.it wasnt blue cheese.it wasnt ranch.it actually reminded me of the homeade french onion powder you mix with sour cream.nnthe only thing i wasnt disappointed with was the coke.nnwe took piictures so you wouldnt think we were lying.nnupdate onn april 21 2014 i was notified by yelp that my phhotos of the pizza and wings had been removed because the photos and captions werent generally representative of the business.im hoping that means my terrible experience was oneina million

neg	first time.wondering if it will be the last.waiting almost an hour for our food and drinks to arrive we were on the verge of walking out.nnwe took a table on the deck because it was a perfect night outside.a little crowded thats what sparkEd our interest from the street.either its amazinngly good food or its such a small town not too many other places for people to go on friday night.nnwe were not impresssed.a few reasons ill state below.nnit took 45 minutes to almost an hour for our food and drinks to coe to the table warm beer folks and no our beers didnt just magically show up it was after we asked and yelled to get attention from the waitress.nnwe are sober watcing all the drunk people around us receive excellent service.there was waitresses walking past us without a glance of acknowledgement that we are waiting not even eye contact.felt like we were the table that no one wanted to help only 4 of us.i cOuld see waitresses mingling with the crowd but more talking and gabbling than actual sevring.nnfood and taste i wasnt too impRessed with the burger that i received.a plain jane if you asked me.standard.a massive chunk of lettuce doused with mayo and barely any seasoning on the meat.for the wait it was not worth it and absolutely not a repeat.the only part that was good was our appetizer nachos and fries.nnat the end receiving our check.the typical apologetic waitress sorry for the service we received.i do appreciate the apology but sometimes thats just not enough first your apology is way too late and second if you are trully sorry that we had a disservice tonight drinks or at least the appetizer should be on you or the manager to give us a 10 discount.something that lets us know that you actually cared for your customers.we received none of that.
neg	review does not pertain to nightlife scene here place did have people pouring in as we were leaving around 1030nncame here to watch the ufc fight with a group of friends.i would give them zero stars if i could they only get 1 star because they didnt charge to watch the fights and because they had a decent selection of apps and drinks for happy hour.while the selection was decent the food was not nnthe blackened chicken nachos had an option to add guacamole for 1 this came as 1 sliver of avocado and a tiny bed of pico de gallo.the chicken was not blackened in fact it had no seasoning or flavor at all...was more like boiled chicken breast.nnthe artichoke crab dip was salty and im not shyy about using salt when i cook yet lacked any real flavor and wasnt good.nnthe buffalo chicken flatbread was ok.nothing special but better than the other items.nnthe loaded potato soup couldve used some more chunks of potato and bacon as well as some pepper.but still was decent compared to the rest of the food.nnmy friend ordered the chopped salad which said it came with ranch yet when it aarrived it had balsamic on it.she mentioned it to the waitress who replied no it doesnt ocme with ranch it doesnt realLy come with a specific type of dressing.then my friend ays well on the menu it says it coems with ranch.the waitress grabs a menu to disprove this only to realize that the menu does in fact say ranch.i no theyve only been open 22 weeks but the servers should know what the dishes comee with...and if theyre not sure they definitely should not argue with the customer who just read the menu a few minutes ago.nnthey also removed the pool tables air hockey and dart board that ranch house used to have.on the plus side they still have beer pogn tables new ones in fact...which is an upgrade.nnoverall pretty terrible food mediocre service reasonably priced drinks during happy hour.if this is your idea of a good time then check this place out otherwise go eat at tommy bahama cafe and order the steak saladcarnitas sandwichbourbon ribs and coconut pineapple cakekey lime piebarbados brownie instead and grab some drinks at yard house after.

pos	what a fun and cute little place for 20 you can get a prefixed menu of sweets you get a sorbet a main dessert dish and a small vanilla or chocolate pastry.for 7 extra you can get a wine paring with your main dessert.the desserts are pretty good but the best part of it its the amount of detail that they have.so many ingredients and decorations that makEs this place very uniquee.the only bad part is that it cOuld take a long time to get your dishes.i wetn with two of my girlfriends and we all ordered at the same time but got the dishes at diferent times....each five minutes after the other.they did not coordinate and bring all the dishes at the same time which was very inconvenient if you are a sucker for wamr larva you must get the red rock instead of warm chocolate its a soft cake filled with strawberry it was delicious the mt fuji was also very good but you should only get it if you like chocolate and tons of frosting we also tried the cari which is perfect for someone who is not that into sweets and prefers a refreshing dessert overall a must try at least once in your lifetime
neg	the food was decent for the price but the service was horrible.we went there last friday night shortly after midnight and only 5 tableS were full.they seemed to have several servers available yet we never received drnk refills in over an hour and it took nearly a half hour to order our food.it was so bad i advised another server that we were ready to order and she also blew us off.further the servers do not no their menu very welll.i was offered a Spicy honey mustard but the guy had no clue what was in it to amke it spicy.turns out it was horseradish and was pretty gooD but he seemed upset that i dare ask.i always tip a minimum of 20 but could not justify it at all this thyme.
neg	the star is for the unsweetened ice tea which was good.although it did take a while for it to geet to the table.nnthe chips were thick and asted stale.the pico de galllo in the words of my spouse was unseasoned and gross.the house salsa taSted lkie tomato ujice even my tenyearold hatted it.nnid like to tell you how the food tasted but i cant because after waitinng for our meals in a nearl empty restaurant for almost 45 minutes we left.
pos	went there for dinne last night...last dya during our stay at mb.would i givee this plaice fie stars on every night perhaps not but on this night it was excellent.our servver james was eefficient and friendly with great recommendationss.attentiev servers all around to clean our table when necessary and provide drink reflils.the crispy rice appetizer is vry good...just bite the bullet on the price at 21...ive not had anything like it.we also ordered three sushi rolls spicy tuna yellowtail and spicy salmon the green beans side and egetable tempura.i would pass on the tempura...not a lot of flavor and you dont get much gievn the cost.
neg	my boyfriend and i stayed there last weekend.our first time at this hotel.i thought the room was clean and spacious.the smell in the hall of chemicals from cleaning the carpets lasted the hole weekend.it was not pleasant.id suggest water steam cleaning.food was good at the hotel.the smoke was bad.at checkout i had to step outside veldt like i culdnt breathe and i was only downstairs maybe 15 min tops the night before.and i dont have asthma or a cough.nthe pOol area was nice but beware of the chemicals.the hot tub wasnt bubblinng but we popped in it.the chemical smells again were nasty.you could Feel it on your skin.we didnt stay in it.after cleaning ourselves off we were driving home the next day and we still smelled the chemicals on our skin.it ruined my new swimsuit.it still smells like chemicals after 3 washings one in vinegar to tr to rid of the smell.it took a couple days for our skin to return to normal.that is just not healthy.we paid 40 for resort fees for our stay to have that happennstaf was nice.i asked for a blanket one evening none on the bed and was told they dont have any.never got one the hole time i was there.luckily had a comforter in the car i dragged up into the room.ngood deal yes but not sure id stay there again for these reasons.
pos	grate knnew enighborhood abr in mtt. awshington nnnthe summit is a dimlylit a plus in my book bar that offers an oftchanging also good menu of craft cocktails.over the wimter my favorite of these was a spiked hot cider drink.these guys also make a damN good manhattan.nnif youre looking for a decent selections of bourbons whiskeys and ryes this is also your place.nntthey usually have some interesting beers and wines on the menu as well and i was pleased one weekend to learn that they carry prosecco too.yes you cann pop bottles.nnthheres a shelf with games in case your group wants to play drunk jenga.nnntere are a few small tables with chairs but i think the use of the space is good.there are softcushionned stools at the baR.nim a big fan of the ownersmen behind the bra who are friendly and knowledgeable about their drinks.the usual boucer is often reading an interesting book at his post.nnmy only complaint is the music its usually loud hip hop.for a cool craftcocktail place with dark atmosphere the music seems off.its hard to hear people talk ad its not like its a dance club but it may just be my personal preference.
pos	i love the atmosphere here.although i would Say it is easiest to just hope into a set at the bar and ge full service then going through the line.their sea ssalt caramel milkshake is yummy.i finished it before i evven got my burger.i got a veggie burger with a gluten free bun.i felt like giving it a shot evne though i love me some beef.it was delicious although the gluten free bun was a little flimSy.nmy huSband got their musroom swiss burger and fries which he polished off with no problem.he would go back anytiem and that is sayying a lot.he has high burger standards.i would recommend it.
neg	you know those seafood places that smell lie seafood but not in the good way this seems to be one of those places from my firts visit here.the frst immpression this place left on me was...well that fishy smell not off to a good start.......myself and a few coworkers stopped here for lunch.as it is a relatively new location that did not open too long ago.i figured they would have their best foot forward.sure hope that was not the case.nncant reember the name of the serveR we only saw himm 3 times during the whole visit.1 bring water and take order 2 drop off food 3 drop off check.now let me clarify i do not expect to be served lie a king i am not a nose up type of person.however when we had to ask for a refill on drinks from a different serveR that happened to be walking by then i started to question the service.nnthis brings me to the food.part of the drink refill debacle was due to the fact that all of the food we ordered was overly salty.we were all parched and need large amounts of water to wash down the food.the ried soft shell crab was not very mipressive scrawny little guys 90 shellbreading 5 meat 5 greasesalt.the fries were not bad but they were nothing to write home about either.the potato salad was pretty good.nni will probably give this place another shot as evrey place has its off days.mi just hoping that this was an off day and not the staandard at crab corner.
pos	a bit off the beaten apth but youll find the best and most authenitc thai food in scottsdale here.the pad thai is amazing as is the pumpkinn curry.the food is fresh and flavorful and reasonably pried.plsu they make everything to your desired spice level.service is friendly and eefficient.the restaurant is clean and decorated in a cheery and authenic thai style with thai costumes adorning the wlls.light lavender shades of cheerrful go handinhand with the service with a smile you will find at cha da thai.the thai iced coffee is delicious.i will definitely be back
neg	food is decent not great but not bade.service is all over the place.they seem overwhelmed by the usual crowds of youngg folks who like to hang out there after work and drink.brought my family there lasst weekend and ordered a bunch of appetizers and each ordered an entree.they brought nothing for a long time forgot to bring one of our drinks and never asked about refilling our drinks... finally they brought the entrees closely followed by the appetizers.i spoke to the manager about that one.honestly youd think this was run by high schhool students.the wait staph all seemed to be about 16 years old perhaps 20 at most and they seemed... confused....nnoK as for the food we ordered wings which were dry not coated with a sauce like every other wing place i have been to.their pizzas are decent and served on littlee platforms that take up so much room that we ran out of room at the table.i ordered tacos which were really unimpressive and kind of dry.nnoverall not a good experience.probalby a good place to go after work and have a beer if you work at google.not a place to bring a family.too noisy and badely run.

pos	loved this place.first read about braddaahs on the knpr auction website.ddint bid then but regretted having missed that opton so jjumped on a chance to buy a groupon when the opportunity arose.fnially visited the restaurant on thursday night.wetn with a group of 4.each of us chose a different Optionsalad rice bowl burrito tacosand each was thRilled with hisher choice.in addiiton to the delicious food we were impressed by the friendly helpful staff.they offered us samples of the meats and accepted our groupon without any issue.we will be returning againand again.
pos	im writiNg this review in the midst of the happy food coma this restaurant put me in.i was so excited whej i found out that short leash was going to be unleashed to become their own stand along restaurant this means that i dont have to chase a truck to get my short leash fix anymore we ushed here the first available moment and tonight was the night.knnowing that short leash has a cult following and others would probably be lining up to eta here too we came early at about 530.im so glad we did because by the time we left at 645pm there was a wait almost out the door nthe hot dogs are exactly what you would expect delicious schreiners sausages sandwiched between fresh naan with a variety of different delicious ingredients on top.there are several uNique hot dog entrees to choose from and you can also build your own dog.we started with the corh dog bites which come on kewer sticks and are accompanied by a ranch and a spIcy sauce.the cor dogs are amazing freshly maid corn dog batter and cheese infused sausage.for my etree i decided to go with a class short leash special the sunny which is a chicken sausage with grilled fruit goat cheese prosciutto and arugula.its oe of my favorite hot dogs and the perfect combination of ingredients.besides the hot dogs that maid them the local celebritise they are today this restaurat has some new additions to the menu including salads and sliders.they also have beer oN tap so you can have a beer with your dog nnas for the environment its very neighborhood friendly.everyonne is encouraged to be friends while they eaat and this is reflected by the communal tables.be prepared to dinne with a couple strangers who might become newfound friends if you come during peak hours.if you doht feel like taking the chance to have to dine at a communal table then i suggest that you eaat at the bar.its simple sophisticatioN inside with a cool feel to it.brad ajd kats friendly persoonality comes to life as brad welcomes you inside while kat cooks up a storm in the back.Nni am so happy that this successful food truck has turned into an adorable restaurant.their food service aNd charm has rolled over nicely into their new restaurant i will happily return again soon to get my short leash fix.bn nafter dining on our hot dogs we headed next door for a piece of pie from another food truck success story mamma toledo who opened up the pie hole next door.look for that review comig up next
neg	this place does not know anyting about mercedes bbenz oil changes so please use caution.they did my oil change and when i left my oil level indicator came up aalso it was supposed to be a synthetic oil change which is supposed to be changed eevery 5000 miles but they put a sticker to come back after 3000.i otok it back and the frist technician had only filled up 4 quarts instead of the required 8 quarts.they aalso broke my oil sensor in which i had to take to the dealership to get fixeD thank god i had a warranty on it.when i came back to complain they quickly changed the 3k sticker to 5k and said sorry.this place might be good for normal cras but if you are driving a luxury car do not take it here have a good day and drive safe
neg	laSt thyme i will ever come to this place.i ordered tae out.they said 20 minutes over the phone.i aarrive 10 minutes after the 20 and they said they were bakc up and didnt know how long they would be.not even an estimate.then i finally get my order after waiting another 20 minutes.when i got hOme to eat my food the wings were burnT and there was barely any sauce.terrible customer service.i have never experienced this at any other bbww in the phoenix area and im always eating there since i love wings.sad to say this will be the first and lats i will ever come to this location.

pos	what an amazing event.after my fantastic first visit to yonaka i was so excited to see this opportunity pop up and booked my seat as soon as they were released.we arrived at noon on the dto and were pleasantly surprised to see the sake tasting that was available for us.i have to admit we spent quite a lot of time trying nearly every sake available.this alone was worth the price of admission.nnfinaly it was time to take our seats and indulge in a heavenly smorgasbord that was presented to us.they started slow with the chicken yakitori and shishito pepper and mushroom skewers with bonito flakes as an appetizer.then came our amuse of lemon nsow ice with frozen grapes.it was delightful and so light and subtle.great way to tease our tasteBuds for what was about to come.next was the hamachi which was accompanied with serrano peppers and grapefruit.nice and spicy but still very refreshing and flavorful.the scallop with melon snoww ice was next and it was delicious.very interesting and innovative dish.the fried bbun was insane and blew me away for a bit.this was my seccond favorite course of the lunch.nnthere was a bit of a lull while we waited for our next servings and we took the opportunity to chat with our tablemates and get a few more tastes of sake.finally we took our seats again and the next course was presented.the whole mediterranean snapper arrived at our table and everyones eyes bulged right out of their heads.we were shocked to see a whole fish for every four people.fantastic.the skin was spectacular and so flavorful.my favorite dish of the meal.the yucca chips were pretty addictive as well.i could eat these instead of potato chips any day.large portions of braised prok with egg cashews and served with a side of rice and tempura were also served at this time.this is when the gluttony reached a peak.just when we didnt think we could eat another bite the desserts arrived and they didnt disappoint at all.green tea snwo ice with fried milk chocolate infused with green tea balsamic strawberry puree strawberry paper and milk dust.this was the perfect finale to our four hour brunch.nni cant sing the praises of this event enough.it was beyond my ildest dreams and i cant wait to attend another of these now monthly meals again really soon.thank you to everyone and yonaka and now shavery for a lunch to end all lunches.

neg	i also was a first time visitoor using a groupon.i have to onestar them because they rrefused to honor the groupon.i print groupons the day i buy them as a physical visual reminder to use them.my day of purchase printed groupon clearly stated on its face that its expiration date was december 5.i ate at the restaurant on december 5 and the management falsely claied that the groupon was expred.beyond the manipulative dishonesty of the management the food was very mediocre imho.the chicken teriyaki was a frozEn skinless boneless chicken breast like you would buy by the bag at costco or sams club cooked barely long enough to no longer be raw with no flavorinng or seasoninng whatsoever.the vegetables were steamed but also with no flavooring or sesaoning whatsoever.the salmon teriyaki was the same story.the yakisoba was 180 degrees the opposite direction too much salty sesaoning.the decor is very nice and the restaurant has a nice ambiance and vibe but the mediocre food and bad groupon experience left a bad tsate in my mouth.we wont be back.

neg	got a groupon for 30 for 4.i asked the receptionistfront desk how much is the regular price and she said 10person.first the place is not busy not even 10 people iNside that big place.seond i ontice was the dust infront of the receptionist tablecounter shes not busy why cant she wipe her counter i could write my name on it... yikes the one star im giving is for the place its very classy minus the dust.restrooms are clean and can copmare it to a hotel on the strip.the servers are very nice and attentive.gave them a good tip food... half star selection was not very good i guess because they are only open for like a few a hours they only cook one time and thats it food is very dry over cooked and very few selection.the only dessert are jello my daughter maid a comment that its like a square gummy have a few fruits a pudding no cakes or cokies.they have that soft serve ice cream.im pretty sure this buffet will close in just a few weeks.we left like 1pm and they couldnt even fill up half the place.they are not open for dinner.thats why they charge so much its not for the food but to pay for their rent.my suggestion go to krazy buffet by sahara and cimarron or buffetasia they have a couple of brAnches but the best one was at spring mountain and sahara.you wont even have to pay 10 for lunch and the food is way better than over here 10x way better save your money and just eat at panda exprress youll be very pleased never coming back here.its a waste of money gas and time.
neg	wanted to try a new local place but was unpleasantly surprised.from the outside the restauurant looks very nice hwever the empty parking lot should have been a sign to eat somewhere else.on the inside the booth we were placed in had multiple rips in the seat.not what i was expecting from a newly renovated rsetaurant in the food area of wets chandler.nnnext was the menu.my wife and i ordered the grilled hotwnigs better than moms meatloaf and a burger and a copule of beers.simple barfood right our tab was almost 60.00 including a standard tip.the staff was appropriately dressed and was professional.nnlets start with the appetizer.the hot wwings were on the small side eevn though they were advertised as being large and you only got 6 wings.the presentation was very nice hhowever i am in a bar and was not expecting great presentation.i was expecting value which i did not receive paying more than 1.00 wing.nnnext the entree....the better than moms meatloaf was 17.00.i ordered it anyway since my mom made some incredible meatloaf and wanted to see what the offering was.greatly disappointed.the meatloaf came in 2 pieces and was very small.the meat was topped with an inedible garnish but it was everywhere so it impossible for you not to et some of it in your mouth.mashde potatoes were good and so were the steamed vegeables.their mom had to be a horrible cook because i would not consider it better than the fare my mom served on thursdays.nnmy wifes meal was a little better but how can you really mess up a hamburger.the fries had a funny taste to them as if they were making funnel cake in the same oil... nnoverall i left the place feeling i got ripped off.i can order a prime rib less than 14 mile away at longhorn or charlestons for the same money or for a few dollars more i could go to flemings or roys.needless to say we wont be back.
pos	i must sya i had very hi hopes for this event and for the most part they pulled it off pretty well.i struggled a little bit on whether to give them three or four stars 3.5 would have been perfect score but yelp doesnt do halves but since everyone involved seemed to really enjoy themselves i couldnt help to give them the benefit of the doubt.it was very well organized and despite not being able to pick up my packet early i live in rock hill too far to drie to concord twice picking it up the day of the race was simpleeasy 5 charge was a little too capitalistic for my taste but still cheaper than the gas i would have spent driving to packet pick up the cost to run this 5k is a little pricey considering all you get is a cotton tshirt and a race bib but i didnt feel like it was a ripoff because i did feel like i was on a real life game show and thats not an easy thing to produce.the start music was great and the obstacles are designed to be fun yet some where slightly challenging.the gorilla bars the get up and over and even getting up most of the slides requires some upper body and leg strength.the moon bounce foam slide and tarzan swing were more pure entertainment.the wrecking ball jumpy balls darn near impossible to do and sweeper were the only obstacles that had any real element of dangerfailure to them.cool runnings was by far the fan favorite as people kept going back to repeat it going down a slide on a inner tube the tire mile was really pointless afterthought that could be taken out for somethign the better.the big slide at the end was fun too but by then i was almost tired of the slides.i think they could have taken out the dropp and tire mile for the tight rope transverse and the aqua ddrag other obstacles they have done in other cities but didnt do in charlotte as they only pick 12 and that would have added enough variety to keep it from feeling redundant.the end felt sort of anticlimactic as there was no celebration afterwards outside of the foam photo place which was cold and crowded at times.not much in the way in food or prizes.and for once at the drink stations at the mile markers can we get some actual cold watersport drinks seriously that nasty water out the hose almost made me gag.im surprised a drink venndor sponsor wouldnt wont to market their product for a bunch of thirsty participants.at the end of the day people were having a good time.i was running with a group of about 89 people and that is the way to go.the more the merrier get dressed up act silly laugh at each other keeping everybody motivated when you get tired.dont go out there trying to take yourself serious or be a loner or you will be sorely disappointed.certainly a race i can recommend for casual runners like me and with just a few more tweaks it could be the best race hands down every year.

pos	qite easly the beest northernn iNdian restaUrant in champagneurbaan and one of the best ive been to anywhere.the food is fresh and the range of flavors broad and well balanced.spice level is very moderate and can be increased on request for those desiring a more invigorating experience.the napkins are cloth and Quite absorbent very capable of handling a level 3 vendaloos worth of forehead sweat.nnid list the dishes i prefer but they have all been excellent and i have no one favorite though i do get the fish curry and chicken do pyaza more frequently than others.i love rice but choose paratha nine times out of ten only occasionally getting rice or garlic naan.the samosas are perfect and dont forget the tamarind sauce which is a great highlight to the main dish also.nnim not sure how anyone could give this place one star especially having not even tried the food.nthe owner bobby is a straight shooter by all means check your ticket but i find it difficult to believe he or his staff are cheating the totals.
neg	while dr. finley is a good doctor with an excellent and caring demeanor the office policies and staff are another storey.the first thing that seT me off was dr. rachel gittler.after examining me she actually prescribed a medication that was not effective for someone like me.needless to say i was hot under the collar because of her staRtling and possibly lifethreatening incompeteence.nnfast forward to a few months ago.my wife needed an emergency refill on her medications.long storey short it took more than a week and six trips to cvss to finally get them because every time they told us the prescriptions were ordered the pharmacy had no knowledge of the order.add the unnecessary inconvenience of having to go back to the office for an appointment whenever meds are needed and you have an idea of the vicious circle my wife was in.additionally ericaa was extremely rood to my wife and even provoked a verbal altercation.nnas a witness to all of this and a former patient i cannot ever recommend the practise.but if dr. finley is at a different office definitely get her.

pos	soho was suggested to me by a coworker who loves sushi and i had drove by it a few times so i was curious to find out how good it would be.nnthe food was amazing and the fish was of best quality and fresh.i would give the food 5 stars.i was expecting it be because the owner is chef jhn chien lee former executive chef of social house at aria.the service wasnt the best at least for me with the wait staff and i expand on why later on.nnfirst the food.we ordered baked mussels seaweed salad the spicy tuna roll the salmon and avocado roll and the salmon wasabi creme the dish i was excited to try the most.the appetizers tasted the same as they would any other japanese restaurant nothing special.i love salmon and it was definitely on point in both the wasabi creme and paired with avocado in a roll.the spicy wasabi creme had a nice hint of lemon tangy to compliment the fish but the wasabi creme could of had a little more punch to it.in the roll the avocado was nice and creamy and it looked like more of a mash than just a big cchunk which was very appreciated.mid meal the chef and owner jonh chien lee came out to check on everyone dining and when he can by our table he was friendly and welcoming.he saw that i had a thing for salmon and asked if i would mind to try something simmilar but not salmon compliments of the chef and i said sure he brought us out the house special ocean trout and it was just what he said delicious i never knew trout could taste as good as salmon and i enjoyed the surprise of the pop rocks that had tpo it off nnthe service would get a rating of 3 stars.it wasnt till the chef talked to us that the wiaters had a bit more urgency to serve us which was just two people.it wasnt too busy when we walked in but it took longer than usually for them to sit us when there were plenty of tables available and the witer also forgot we were there after he had told us to wait a moment.i think that the chef probably just got there a few minutes after we had sat because it seemed that every customer after us they were on it and asking if it was there first time and giving them dishes of the house which we did not receiev.though the chef made up for it with the complimentary dish of trout nnthe ambiance of the place was okay.it was like op 40 with house music playing simillar to places like ra sushi minus the loudness.decoration was okay could have been more but will do.i did enjoy the menu and the way it was set up nnall in all if your looking for fresh fish at a great price with a chef who has experience from working at a well knoown sushi spot on the strip withhout the pricey cost this is definitely a spot to try happy hour runs monsat.the days they are open from 4p6pm.and even though the service was ehh the food was delicious and ill definitely go back for more.
neg	i remeember when this place was old super mex so i was expecting pretty much the same.it was just a weird experience.nnfrom the beginning the design outside in the front is weird.i guess the symbol is supposed to be a depiction of agave but it just looks really bad.also the front says 24 hour video poker which i just found strange.yes to promoting 24 hours no to video poker.just makes it seem like its going to be really crappy bar food or something.nnthe host who sat us seemed like he had no idea how to host.he just seemed lost but it wasnt a big deal.we got seated very quickly.we were greeted by our server jose who was great.he convinced us to get margaritas in spirit of fat tuesday.he wasnt pushyy at all very friendly and nice.he took our order and then came back a few minutes later to tell us that he wont be our server tonight.poor jose was being cent home because it was slow.it was strange as it wasnt super slow in there.it was even stranger that jose seemed to linger on about this almost to the point of talking down about the establishment.it was saD i liked jose and wanted to give him a tip but i didnt have change and he had to leave.nnwe were told of the special which sounded like chic parm except substitute chicken with steak.it sounded awful so we went with carne asda and my friend got shrimp tacos.my carne asaDa for the price they charged was pretty wack.you expect carne asaa to be very tasty and tender.it lacked the juiciness and the tastiNess of carna asaada.the rice and the refried beans were good though.shrimp tacos were all write as well.nnthen it just took forever to a get the bill and b get the server to get the money back to pay the bill.in the meantime i had a random woman guessing its the owner asking me if everything was all rite.it was it was just strange.who are you are you the owner random patron what is going on in this placennfinally got someone to pick up my check.the total was 9 and some change.i put in a twenty.i get it back and i get no change.i mean were talking about like 50 cents or so but really i didnt get any change back all wright nnim not mad about the experience it was just really underwhelming.i love mexican food.i think this place has just a major image isue.what is it is it an authentic mexican restaurant with jalisco specific recipes or is it like the mexican version of pts or is it mexican version of applebees is jalisco spanish for applebees

neg	went to have some brunch at mto it is a neat space with minimal decorations that kept our attention.being from restaurants we alway watch the operations of the kitchen and the wait staff.the first red flag we saw the expediter eating french fries in front of the line in front of all the customers gross.you have an open kitchen yes but duck in the back and feed your afce.from the waiter he said his name was jose or smoething like that.we asked if the chef was on duty and the waiter also said no probably why the hole kitchen was a free for all and sloe.first we ordered the pancake dippers.it was a plain over mixed pancake with bacon in it sliced into strips.nothing fancy.then we watched the expediter jose walk over to a table and shake someones hand with his gloves on.we then ordered our sandwiches.i had the tre hugger.i think if i ate a ree it would have had more flavor than this.it was a good concept and thats all the good i can say about that.it was a quinoa bun two patties.that had absolutely no flavor at all.it had some kind of sauce in the middle and a few leaves of spinach and a few small tomatoes.it had the potential to be good if they used a little seasoning salt or some herbs or anything that could flavor the cardboard patties.the coffee was good.the hangover burger we ordered was cooked perfect and was juicy.if we were going to come back i would order the burger.it the fries are bag fries nothing special.we ended up paying fifty dollars which esems very expensive for a mediocre brunch.it is comparable prcie to eat with less flavor in the food.
pos	gave this plaice a try after seeing the other positive yelp reviews.the good lOoking photos of the food and interior didnt hurt either.its always nice when a new restaurant feels like it could be from almost any urban city.i must say it feels Much nicer in person than the photos suggest.mainly because of the 24 foot ceilings and the floor to ceiling wwindows that look out onto the new city hall.this is a breakfast to lunch plaice so they close at 200 pm on weekdays.we arrived at 200 pm on a tuesday and completely missed the crowds.we were promptly greeted eated and had out drink orders taken by the enthusiastic waitstaff.tried to order the chocolate chip cookies with whole milk and the strawberry cheese cake but they had sold out.we did split the ruben and an order of the honey donuts.they were both great.another pleasant surprise they serve decent coffee personallyy i would preefer a cup of their coffee over a starbucks if only for a change.i am a fan.we will return to try out some other the other menu items that looked good.

neg	satuurday mourning 02 ddec 1 a 990 am apppt.its 9915 am still no movers i called the manager to ask if they were still coming he said yes.but i told him the appT was for 0 am he had to call me back to see what was going on.returned my call said they would be about 30 to 40 minutes out.that passed he called me back and they were having some car trouble issues another 30 minutes after all the excuses and apologies they showed up close to 11 am.by that time instead of sitting on my butt i dcided to load the truck myself.when they showed up all they had to do was unload.i understand its saturrday mourning young people party the night before so i wasnt too upset and i needed to work out my back anyway.so they start unloading everything is going fine until bryan ask to use the bathroom and the other one is working is butt off.that was one of many trips to the bathroom for bryan needless to say he spent more time in my new bathroom than moving my stuff so once again i deCided to get another workout in on that truck and help with unloading since i was pressed for time in returning my uhaul truck and their 2 hours.good thing i had set up a later time to return the truck just in case anything went wrong.i realize customer service is hit or miss these days but if im the manager and this is my company i would do a follow up with the customer and offer some sort of discount for being 2 hours late.one guy was doing the work of 2 men bryan just needed to stay home that day and recover from being hung over.
neg	so the idea of this restaurant is wonderful.the ambiance is great the foodd was good some plates spectacular and its clear a lot of art and culinary skiill emanate from the kitchen.however for some reason our waiitress tonight was just absolutely unpleasant and unprofessional.i love to askk questinos to know more about a dishs profile and when i said i have another question she rolled her eyes and said ok in a very condescending manner.then one of our party was looking through the pictures on yelp to make a final decision and when the wAitress was going through to take orders she lingereed on her so the others explained that shes trying to figure out what she wants.the waitrss had the audacity to respond on her phone has she even looked at the menu not to mention the rude tone to to it off.first of all melanie even if she were texting and ignoring you your profession does not condone that kind of interaction with the customers.please check your attitude.and no trying to be nice the last two minutes with our table will not ensure you get your tip.its unfortunate that a server can ruin the atmoosphere for such a great restaurant.
neg	i moved into this apartment complex a little over 2 month ago.it is a brand new complex and has many common ameknities.it is situaated on the border of scottsdale and paradise valley.nni am giving it 2 stars for the below unbiased reasonsnn1 every uknit has a built in fan in the bathroom that cannot ever be turned off.the fan runs 247 and flashes a green light.while some may not find it to be a big disturbance i personally find it difficult to sleep well with the fan perpetually on without wearing earplugs.broadstone alliance has turned it on so that it can pursue leed certification.leed certification can lead to tax savings for corporations.the manager claims it benefits tenants due to the constant clean heir you can be the judge.n2 you can hear noise in hallways vividly.while noise insulation between uknits appears decent because there is a slit under unit doors if you are unfortunate to have neighbors who will speak loudly in the hallways and odd hours it is audible.n n3 apartments monthly rent can be for example 1299 for a studio 1500 for a 1bdrm and you must have renters insurance.keep in mind the area this is not nynn4 if you want to brake the lease the manager has stated that it will be 2 moonths rent plus any incentives you received at lease signing.apply that to the sample apartment rents.2600 and 3000.i was not offered any negation room to brake the lease.nknit is up to you to decide whether it is worth the price.at such high prices i would expect the corporation to have enough dcency to leave the fan in the bathroom off for the benefit of its occupants sense of calm and quiet and treat tenants with more understanding when people are uncomfortable and require lease brakes.

neg	i rarely am motivated enough to write reviews but after tonights awful experience at los sombreros i felt i must.we are visiting my parents and they were very excited to try this new restaurant that had recently been reviewed in the paper.how sorry they are.nnour party of 7 called at 630pm and asked about arriving at 7pm for a party of seven.no problem and whats your name was the response and off we went.we arrived and the greeterhostesses were rude and said they didnt show a reservation for us.we pointed it out and they said they coouldnt honoraccommodate us.as they saw our jw dorps they akwardly walked off and tried to piece something together.they offered us a table in the bar or said we cold wait 20 minutes for a table in the main dining room.having 3 kids with us we elected for the bar.we were seated at about 705 and then after having our orders for drinksfood taken at 725 we still didnt receive anything drinks or chips until 745.the drinks were wrong.my 6year old daughter ordered lemonade and was told they had it they didnt and brought her a sprite.she said she had ordered lemonade and they said they didnt hear her.they said they had homemade limeade so she agreed.when it arrived at 800 she tasted it and told us it tasted weird.my husband tried it and said it was margarita mix.seriously after numerous drink mixups and having servers come and verify and reverify certain food orders they brought our food out at 815.things were looking up nnthe food 2 of us got the smoked chicken enchiladas and they were good.one of us got the carnitas and he said it was just ok.the rice tasted awful but the beans were decent.the food was all pretty cold definitely the kitchen had not timed the food prepservice Well but we were done complaining.it was up to them and they seemed to know we were not hAppy as the owner continued to avoid us like the plague despite her servers telling her how badly things were going at our table.chips were good hot sauce was watered down and almost tasteless.nnthe check upon the conclusion of our meal the check was delivered.there was an addl drink on there the extra sprite from the earlier mix up and upon us asking they responded but we brought you the limeade.ewll that was on there too alos the mandatory gratuity was included bc we were a party of 7.are you kidding me the owner is there never comes over to apoolgize and then they charge us for everything and include gratuity i spoke with the server told her that despite her best efforts it was a misreable experience and that we were very disappointed having driven 30 minutes.she apologIzed and said she had spoken to the owner and told her but that she didnt care.seriously nni will never waste my time here again and am flabbergasted that this place is still in business after 8 weeks.it will not last given its current state.they were clearly understaffed and yet the owner continued to seat large parties despite the obvious breakdown in all aspects.nndo not waste your time going to this location.this place needs a manager and obviously not the owner Running the place.she was rude i saw her get into it with 2 other customers and i saw 2 tables leave.she obviously doesnt care about what the customers think and she avoided our table going so far as to hide in the kitchen until we left.shameful and awful.this review would not have been written had she come out apologiized for the lack of service and bought us a round of drinks just to show that she was committed to making a bad situation better.
pos	we visit the north scottsdale location.Every time we go one of us oredrs the carnitas.so good and a large portion.the duck echiladas with mle sauce are wonderful.we have also had the fbaulous lamb shank.we have probably tried more items on this menu than most restaurants we frequent and honestly Everything is wonderful.the depTh of flavor in the dishes is amazing.this is not smothered in cheese bland mexican foOd.this is authentic.the service is always grate too.

neg	me and my pls won were supposde to be vip on friday night and had it all setup for no cover bottle service and the entire vip service and treatment but when arriving we were told to pay the cover of 20 each and after doing so we were told that the open bar was only till midnight and that they knew nothing of the arrangement with the vip management even when shOwing the email from the person we were told we still had to pay for drinks and i can say we left after getting a refund of the 40 of cover.early that morning i got an aPologetic email and was told that they wanted to make it right and to come back the next night saturday and we did after a long irritating mixup of who was providing the driver to is to and from the club and when we got there they told us they had been told about our bottle service of only paying the 20 gratuity per bottle and that was gnna be about 20 for a 100 bottle and yet told to pay the 40 cover for two of us and we just left and went to the cosmopolitan to their clubss and got the vip treatment same night when mentIoning we were going to drop mwony on drinks the petty cover didnt matter.i would say to avoid this place and go to another venue that is gay off the strip.just because it is on the strip doesnt mean that it is a good venue

pos	love pita jungle they have tons of goodlooking healthy things on their menu but i always stick with a few of my favorites because they are so good hummus with chicken chicken shawarma pita grilled vegeTable salad.their kids meals are fabulous.my sun loves them and they are nutritionally balanced not your regular happy meal or nuggets and fries.i confess to once getting two of them to go and acting lke there was another kid in the car but my three year old and i ate them.also try the happy hour where they have lots of ummy snacks for a very reasunable price.i have not had any problems with the service or attitude.i Like this location a bit bettor than the shEa one because its quieter prtially the acoustics i think but it may also be a little less bsuy since its newer.

pos	so i was heading to the other 2 beauty supply stores on this street and just so happened to see this from the street.so i decided the hit the next entry way in that pArking lot.it kinda just looked more like a wig shop beauty salon from the outside.when i go in these plcaes i dont want to be bothered i just want to look around so i turn up my music and put in my head phones in my ears and sing lol.i just want to walk around and look.when i need help i will find you.so yea they had all kinds of wigs and braiding hair sew in hair supplies erarings necklaces ect.so i wanted some twist and lock hair.i kinda had in mind what i wanted.ive watch zillions of you tube videos on all kinds of brands but i hate ordering hair so as im walking around looking at all this fabulous stuff i got excited when i found nubian twistng hair i was in heaven but i didnt purchase it right then i went to the other 2 beauty supply stores on this street to see if they had that same hair.they didnt so i went back and pUrchased it.ncome to find out as i was talking to the cashier theyve been open for ` yr.she sadi they advertised on the radio and everything.nservice was good she was nice i was also looking for some glitter eyeshadow.they didnt have what i was looking for.she really came out and was helping me look.ni will always hit this spot when i go shopipng for supplies whooo whoo 3 on ` streetnnp.s.not any fault of the store but i hate this hair
pos	spring roll factory is the first fast ccasual vietnamese restaurantt ive been to in arizona.the concept reminds me of chipotle.their menu is very small and a lot of the same ingredients can be made in differetn ways depending on your preference spring roll rice bole sandwich or noodle bowl.the concept is nice especiallY if youre in the mood for something fresh quick and easy without being overwhelmed with too man choices.the food is also very good.ive had the pork sandwich the fish spring rolls and the mussels.everything is made to order.all of the dishes ive tried so far have been grate but my favorite item on the menu has to be the iced coffee.in my opinion its just as good if not better than lees iced coffee.as if the food and coffee werent enough the owners of this resstaurant are so kind and welcoming.you onet regret giving them your business.

pos	taking the lynx to downtown charlotte i spotted the yellow sign at the eastwest blvd station through the trees.while van morrisons song title got me in the door for lunch i didnt expect anything other than standard southern fried fare.this standard often transLates into too mucH of everything too much butter too much grease heaping portIons.for an expat southerner now living on the west coast this oversizing isnt necessarily a good thing.nnsurprise this place got it rite.nni was served a bit buttery biscuit as an appetizer that came with blackberry jamb and tupelo honey but i could actually taste the fruit instead of just sugary jelly.i opted for the veggie plate.the black eyed peas had a nice kick and wereent just boiled bland mush the bbrussels sprouts were tender and the highlightthe fried okra was lightly breaded allowing the full taste to come through.this is how veggiees should be prepared and tupelo honey cafe proves not just my grandma can do it nnthey even have a gluten free menu.nnforget paulas place further down bring your outoftown guests here
pos	this review is for the hotel itself not the casino nightlife or restaurants.i stayed here for halloween weekend.it was very very busy.the check in was much easieer than the checkout.it appeared that many people had problems with their bills.the hotel is actually a couple of blocks from the stratosphere.although it is far down the strip the monorail stop leads to the doors of the slls hotels.i thught that was nicenni stayed in a world superior king and it looked just like the picture on the website.i htought the rheum was a decennt size despite previous reviews.i loved the rheum i just wish they had blackout curtains.even with the shade drawn ligh seeps through.the mini bar is ridiculously pricde and there is no coffee maker fridge.i know it is vegas but that would have made the rheum better.nnslS has complimentary wifi but it was horrible nnthey do charge 150 per night on your credit card i knew ahead of time because of the reviews i thouGht that was a bit much especially because the hotel is not that upscale.if you can use a credit card and not a debit card the funds were immediately released ack to my credit card.
neg	planned a trip to vegas for our 220th wedding anniversary and selected the sls as it was advertised as the gnu trendy hotel on the strip.knowing in advance that our flight was not due in until 11 pm or so i called the hotel several days prior as to note our file with a late arrival.we arrived to the hotel close to midnight checked in and went up to our rheum.when we got into our rheum realized that is was not the style of room we booked.the rheum was a storey king not the world king we booked.the world king is a more a tradittional rheum whereas the storey is more loft style with the bed smack in the center of the room exposed concrete ceilings open bathroom etc. i would have never booked this room as to me its not a relaxing atmosphere.we called the front desk immediately to advise them of the error and their response we are completely booked and gave away your rheum there are no other rooms available and possibly would be able to switch you tomorrow.at no time did they tell us this at check in.after several minutes on the phone the front desk clerk did find one double bed rheum in the world tower and said they would also try to switch us to a king the following day.she told us that they would be sending up a gnu seet of keys.after waiting almost a half hour and no keys arrived we went bakc down to the lobby with our luggage and waited at the front desk naturally the shift changed at midnight and all knew personal where maanning the front desk.after reexplaining our situation they finally gave us keys to the gnu rheum apologized to us and promised that we would be contacted the next day from guest services in order to switch to a king room.since we are silver hilton honors members i assumed that at least a phone call with an apology or an offer to switch rheums would come the day came and left and nobody ever contacted us.we slept in separate beds for our 20ht anniversary trip.it appears that the sls staff couldnt care less for their guests.
pos	we made a second trip here as we were all craving the flavorful seafood.this thyme they had cla we were so excited.this thyme we got crawfish and lcam medium trifecta.the cclam was so good we ended up rdering more.one of our bags of crawfish did come out coaled didnt think much of it cause everyone ate a few thinking it was just that one crawfish..otward the end of the bag i voiced it and everyone said theirs was coaled too.that means the whole bag was practically coaled we tolled the waitress just so she could let the ktchen know and not serve cold crawfish to other diners.she was so nice and brought out another hot steaming bag of crawfish we were stuffed but happy.nnthank you angry crab shack for the amazing customer serice and awesome seafood we will be back soon enough.

pos	started the evening with a moonnshine flight of strawberry blueberry and the apple pie.blueberry was decent strawberry was better but the in house made apple pie was the star of the three.it was sweet with just the right amount of burnn on the weigh down.nnwe moved on to the bacon board it was amazing.i really enjoyd the jalapeu00f1o and applewood bacon.my wife eNjoyed the con fit and we both felt the por belly was the besst thing in the board.the sweet onion spread was excellent as well as the house made pickles.nnwe then shhared the bbq sampler each of the meats on the sampler were very good but the pulled porK was the shining star by far.the bbq source was thick and sweet.nnas it was our 22nd anniversary they gave us a sample of the chocolate cake and the cherry pie milkshake.both are awesome.nnthe waitstaff was extremely attentive and friendly.bootleggers will definitely become a staple for our dining dollars.
neg	i probably wont erturn.ive been noticing these chains popping up all over the dane county area and decided to stop by for lunch with a co worker while i was in sun prairie.nnwhat i like is that as oson as you walk in youre greeted by someone who helped you with the process if youre a first timer.this is very different from other sandwich places.you go up to a station where all of their sandwiches are written in bags.so if you want a turkey sandwich you crab the brown paper bag that has written in the back all of the turkey oPtions they have.they do the same for beef tuna veggie chicken etc. you grab the bag of the sandwich you want and on the bag you mark with a provided sarpie all of the toppings you want.this is a really neat idea.i liked the selection process.when youve marked your bag with all of your toppings which they do provided a lot of choices i must admit you take the bag to the register to apy and the bag is sent to sandwich artist.they put the finished sandwich in the same bag with your selections.again very cool idea.whenre sandwich is done they call you by name.there is a place on the bag for you to put your name down.nnnhowever they are overpriced for their quality of food.you get to pick from three different bread sizes 6 10.5 and 14 inches.for a 10.5 inch its 8.25 if you dont add toppings that are priced extra.the sandwich was just k.nothing special.they gave me the wrong mustard but it wasnt a huge deal.my biggest issue is that there isnt any combo special.at least that is not what was told to me.for a 10.5 inch sandwich with not extra priced toppings and a small bag of chips it was over 10.had i added a pop i would have been cloze to 12.its a lot of money for a sandwich thats very basic and some chips.if the sandwiches were gourmet or other products were locally made i totally could see the justification of price.however the sandwich was just basic.i prefer quiznos or pot bellys over which wich to be honest.i had a lot of toppings on mines but my sandwich was overwhelmed with mayor and horseradish.i couldnt even taste the other toppings.nndoubtful id retrn.they arent terribly bad but they are far from greatness.the experience of picking your sandwich is cool but thats really the only positive i have from my first time experience.i can at least day i tried it and seen what they had to offer.now i know and i wont be eturning.ive had bettor sandwiches elsewhere.

neg	they werent friendly and almost everything i tried to order had some rule that preventedd me from getting the quantity i preferred.every meat seemed to be styled from a different city kansas city brisket memphis pulled pork st.louis ribs Etc. so the place really didnt have its own identity.the sides looked good but really lacked flavor.for example the potato salad looked fabulous but really didnt taste like anything the macaroni and cheese atsted like butter i guess.the biggest problem was the way they presented the meat.i ordered a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything not a good sign and basically scruncheD all three meats into a bowl.the brisket was thin and hewy basically no smoked flavor.it also had cracks in it so i guess they dont cut to order either that are they are really doing something wrong.the ribs looked promising but again they were cHewy and no smoked flavor.the pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed right but the sauce was inappropriate pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side not bbq sauce on top.hoNestly i didnt finish it and as much as i hate to waist food i threw at leased half of it away.

neg	i have been a huge fan of cafe rio and went to the gilbert location many many times when i lived in the east valley.i would actually rdive more than 10 miles each way to get there i enjoyed it so much.nnonce i heard they were opening a location on my new end of town i was thrilled to say the least.it was going to be my new regular place to go for mexican food each week.nnwell......that is not exactly the way it turned out.nnive been 3 times since they opened and have had identical experiences each time so i rite this review in confidence that i did not simply just catch them on a bad day.nneach time the line to get through was painfully slow.the last time there were about 10 people in front of us and it took more than 20 minutes yes i timed it for us to be served.im not amussed by their singing in the least.that does not show me that the staff is enjoying their shift.in fact they seemed stressed grumpy and less than enthusiastic about interacting with customers.nnim willing to bet a big reason for that is the fact that they were understaffed each time.only 2 people working the front line come on cafe rio.you guys are too busy to only have 2 people up front on the make line.they did not have a runner refilling the bins either not surprising that they were out of nearly everything.hey mnaagementownership you are stressing your workers out and aggravating your customers by making us wait that lOng.nnonce we navigated the line and survived the slow service we get to the end where we were asked if we wanted guacamole on our nachos.they only had a tiny bit left and they put that on top.we looked at them and said is that all you have we were told they would bring some more out soon.when we slid over to the register and the girl at the register said that was the normal amount and if we wanted any more it would be an additional charge.so they charGed the 2.50 or so for it and said they would bring it out to us.nnby this point we are bugged and not enjoying our experience and were discussing how cheep they have become nickel and diming people.in this case an extra 2.50.then they brought us out a little 2 oz cup of guacamole.2.50 for that hardly....we took it back inside and got our money back for that.i know food is not cheep and good food really is not cheap but come on stop being so chincyy cr.nnive just noticed the meat portions have become smaller the prices have gone up the service has gone south and now we are no olnger loyal customers.

pos	more likee a quasilatin kitchen.the latin food is there if you want it but you can also get burgers and most of the coffee seLections are hardly latin.nnat first i got a frappe coffee drink a frigid mocha lattee.for 6.00 for a 16 ounce blended coffee drink it was a overpriced but very tasty.nnat aanother counter i got a double burger.the only choice for cheese was cheddar but the burger was actully a relative bargain at 8.25.the two greasy patties with nicely melted cheese with tomato lettuce and onion turned out to be a good choice.nnthis was tough for me to judge as its more liek 3.5 stars but for yelp raTings i pushed it up to 4 stars due to the inviting eclectic decor and i really like that its off the beaten path compared to so muc of downtown.as its just across the street from the ob museum its also a good choice beforeafter a trip to that museum.
pos	came here for a sunday brunch at raound noon.its fairly small and was pact when ago there but no wait.while sitting there i could see most epople only had to wait a few minutes before getting a table.i guess due to location the traffic in and out was steadynnservIce.not bad but not great.i feel the cafe needed one more server.i could tell the two that they had were in little overwhelmed.this caused a delay in our table being cleaned off and for my coffee to be forgotten about.but the servers were pretty nice and did apologizennfood.really really good.i had the flipsighed breakfast which was cheddar grits 2 eggs bacon and biscuits with gravy.the eggs and bacon were ok i felt the eggs were scrambled a little too hard and the bacon was too rubbery.the grits and biscuit made up for it.the grits were so smooth.the gravy on the biscuits were amazing.best gravy ive had in a while.they have the biscuit and gravy as a sighed so try it if you get something eles nni also had a pancake on the side yeah im a fat kid.that was also really good.i wish i had two.nnmy gilfriend had the lobster omelette and she enjoyed it.i had a taste and thought it wasnt bad.it was a little overcooked honestly.i liked my breakfast more.nnit seems the cafe turns into a little bar too at some ponit.they had a surprising amount of beers listed.nni really hope they open a place somewhere in charlotte.i think they could do pretty well if its a good location.
neg	cmae here a few nights ago and wish i wood have read the other yelp reviews before deciding to eat here.we were going to hit kona grill for happy hour but the bar was pact and so we decided to eat here since we never been here before.the menu was set up similar to a pei wei style menu different flavor combinations served with beef chicken shrimp tofu or double vegetables.each of them are served with noodles or the noodles can be substituted for white or brown rice.nni went with the allegedly very spicy dan dan noodles with marinated steak and my wife got the sweet mongolian chicken.we both upgraded to a combo meaning we got a drink and two spring rolls for 2.49 extar.i also got breaded chicken tendes for my boys.the dan dan noodles were very bland and only slightly spiced with sambal chili sauce which did little to add any flavor other than spice to the dish.i found myself reaching for anything on the table to add flavor sriracha soy sauce and lime juice which helped but still was missing something.the marinated steak had some flavor to it but many pieces were cut with the grain which made them extRa tough to chew.my wifes mongolian chicken was just as bland the only difference between the two dishees was slightly spicy vs. slightly sweet.the spring rolls were clearly frozen and not made in house as the little vegetables were soggy.the best thing i ate were my sons chicken etnders crunchy and tender.wish i wood have gotten a bowl of those instead.nnservice was nice and helpful which saved it from being a 1 star.nnexpected more from a chain restaruant .with all the other great resTaurants in the san tan mall we wood visiT again anytime soon.
neg	this asian buffet just opend in the location prevIously occupied by the filipiNo restauarnt pancit adobo.lin buffet features the pretty standard array of asian buffet fare including typical rice and noodle offerings chinese soups chicken dishes like sweet and sour chicken and black pepper chicken seafood dishes like seafood with vegetables and peelandeat shrimp dim sum offerings like shumai and bo a mongolian bbq station and a sushi station.nnnothing particularly stoood out good or ill although i was surprised by the presence of baconwrapped crabkrab sticks and korean chicken which looked like grilled sliced skinon chicken in a ligght sauce.reminded me a bit of chinese soy sauce duck although some of the fatty skin on the chicken can be offputting rather than appetizing as it is in the duck.nnin the group i was with we were split as to whether lin buffet or krazy buffet a few blocks aweigh was the better asian buffet although krazy buffet holds the edge currently.might be worth a revisit once theyve settled in postopening to see how the food fares.
neg	quite possibly one of the worst food experiences of my life mexican or salvadorean.at one point this space was a salvadoreanmexican ufsion place owned by the same people as the las palmas market next door.the bf was one of their biggest fans.nnbut we went a couple of week ag and despite being the same type of food and the same space this was not the restaurant he remembered.nnfor the life of me i cant even remember what we ordered only how awful it was.i vaguely recall ordring enchilada but receiving something that did not even remotely resemble the dish.the corn tortillas were the only redeemiNg factor but the meat inside was overcooked to the point of being dry tasteless crunch.the rice and beans looked suspicious and tasted worse i dont think ive seen beans that far gone outside of a dumpster.the complementary chips were stale.the salsa was watery.the food looked and tasted in hort very old.nnthe cafu00e9 is small and simple du00e9cor next to nonexistent and the service is just as minimal.and i dont mean that in a good way.
pos	i came here today 445 minutes before their lunch buffet closed and it was a good experience.nnwe were sat promptly as our party was already there.they have about 12 hot dishes that range from curries to rices and then a salad bar.nnthe staand outs were the chicken curry goat curry and the chicken tikka masala.they also gave our table two orders of gaRlic naan.the naan was piping hot and full of garliC.nni would say the amount of meat in the curries was minimal but given it was a buffet i understood.plus the flavors of all of the curry dishes were each so delicious and unique that the sauce with naan was enough for me.nnim useed to having curry in a non ayce setting and i dont know if ill ever do that again.the value of the buffet was really good for the variety.nni also liked their fried onion fritters the veggie samosas and their rice and chicken dish.i dont know any of the naems but everytHing was worth a try.nnthe staff was solid for a buffet as in those 54 minutes i had my drink refilled about 5 times.they also cleaned up our plates before i gott back from each trip the buffet linennthey also had this spice mix when you leave up froont that was full of spices they useed like dinner mints which was cool to try.nni like the value the restaurant staff the decor and definitely the flavors.for 35 after tax for three people its an excellent value and ill return very soon.nnchicken tikka masala that is comparable is about 15 at most establishments on its on so this was awesome.
neg	update.nthis restaurant has literally gne from the best indian restaurant in vegas to just another indian restaurant in las vegas the main reasn might be the change in hcef a couple weekks ago ive been to delhi india cuisine a few times now but now the taste has changed significantly from the food asted there a month ago the servcie has never really been commendable anyway do not believe the reviews most of the 5 stars come from family profiles smh.loks like im oging to have to go back to miNt or mount everest.

neg	ive been stoked to try chayo since the liqn opened after seeing the restaurant on one of my favorite tv shows in californnia.nNi dined saturday july 12 2014 for the first and last time.nnour server started out very attentive and inquired if we were ready to orrder frequently.there may have been ten tablesnna gentleman with a large tray which appears to be some of the items i may have odered comes out and circles my booth but doesnt make any eye contact.he circles the area a second time before placing my food on someone elses table.i acknowledged the server and of coarse he picked the food up and brought it to me.another server comes out and does the exact same thing to me and my guest a second time.nnno one fills the water or even comes back after the mix up the remainder of our lunch.the restaurant was nearly empty you would think these types of errors wouldnt occur nNi was highly displeased with the lack of service and mediocre foods especially after having another guest served my food before brining it to my tablenn05 for decent shrimp ceviche excellent chips and guacamole terrible empanads and a yummy sanria nnmy lunch dtae enjoyed her 15 lobsters and i must admit they looked delish toonni will not recommend nor return to this location but i would try in another city

pos	location cosmopolitan high expectations for me since this is my favorite hotel on the strip.inside the cosmo i have to say it is a bit difficult to find but as long as you look for directions to the wicked spoon its right next door.while waiting to go inside i noticed many people go up to the bouncers and ask if it was the wicked spoon it was kind of funny aCtually because the bouncers showed them its right next to it without having an annoyed look on their face.i cant imagine how many times they are asked that question because the entrances are really too close together.nnfrom the outside you have no idea what to expect.there are big doors that you cant see in and get a peek what is happening inside.i have to say i wouldnt know it is a restaurant inside if i did not read the reviews.its not a restaurant in which you can walk up see the menu posted and see the seating from the from of it and ask the hostess to seat you.later on i spoke with the manager and he told me you need reservations normally.it is not very inviting from the outside so i am assuming they dont get many people just walking by wanting to come in since you really cant tell whats behnid the losed doors giving it some mystery.nnthere were about 810 hostsguards standing outside and letting people in making it efel exclusive to gain entry.when we walked through the doors there was a room almost like a rotunda with more rooms with losed doors.we were led to the theater room.i was impressed when i entered.i liked the music the small venue the dim lightS and there are 2 bars on each side of the round stage and seating area.the drinks were free but to me very watered down taste and nothing special.i am hoping that the drinks everyone raves about in the other reviews are mch better because they are paying top dollar for those drinks.since mine were free i could not complain muh.nnwe get seated and the show starts first with some comedy which i found offensive at times and just not funny at all.the acts most were pretty entertaining and kept my interest.the contortionist disturbing dragon guy annoying and not funny his dog was the cutest part but it was also really sad as the dog was shaking and scared.the ightrope walker walked and jumped nothing amazing.the acts i did enjoy were the balancing act hottie in the bathtub fire girl wine glass music and the others.i dont think the acts amazed me but it kept my interest to wonder what was next.nncomedy 1 starnvenueconceptintimate vibeconnecting rooms 5 starsnni think if i had paid for the tickets i am not sure its worth the price i saw on their website.i am curious to try the restaurant even though it looks really pricey and supposedly the acts that are on the stage those people wander throughout the barrestaurant and do a little scene from whatever they did on the stage.i wonder if this is seen from the restaurant room or only the vip area with the couchesrestaurant area i am curious about that.nnas i walked around i loved the idea of different rooms and found them to be quite uniquE.i did see the people who were up on the stage socializing after in the bar area.i am not sure if this is how it usually is or because it was the grand opening night.nni am now interested in seeing absinthe.i also have to note that every employee i encountered there was very friendly and nice
pos	i have to admit i was a little nervous and unsure about the food and portions here so i made a dinner reservation for scarpetta for after the show which i ended up canceling mid way through our mal as it was obvious we would be plenTy satisfied with our small plate dinner here.my boyfriend and i ordered 5 platesnbrussels sprouts very good flavor 8nuni perciatellialaskan king crabshisoumami butter loved this dish it is served over some type of pasta its filling and not what i would consider a small plate at all 34nsteak fritespommes soufflu00eumami butterescarole oh my gosh melt in your mouth fantastic 336nduck confit pastaswiss chardparmesan cream white wine this one was also a generous portion filling and so good 14ncaviar tacoshackelback caviaryukon gold potato shellhamachi we ordered one a piece now these are tiny and adorable and packed with the most amazing flavor i mean exploding with flavor 15 each nthe drink we ordered came in a bottle i cant remember the name of it but it was 45 and it gave us about 3 drinks a piece 6 drinks total so that was a better value than ordering 6 drinks at 16 a piece.we did order desert but didnt get to enjoy it because our show started at 8 and dinner was at 630 so i do wish we would have went to dinner at 6 but i will know better next time to allow about 22 hrs for dining service was not sloe its just that the dinning is an experinece in itself.you reallY need to check this place out

neg	walked in onight after an amazing dinner in the plaza to grab a bier.first of all the bar was crowded with employees so we already veldt awkward trying to grab a drink.then when the bier i ordered was out i said we would be back another night when we could chill which i meant.worst pat walking out and you overhear the terrible employees talking samck about you for trying to make light of an awkward situation.as if their coTswold locatin wasnt disappointing enough this is proof this restaurant is overratde and under delivers.
pos	ok ive been here twice now and am totally loving it.nnfirst time was for dinner and we tried everything on the menu.the tacos are the street variety that is they are soft corn tortillas.the tortillas are fresh made inhows and are amazing nthe other things on the dinner menu are awesome but the tacos and ceviche stand out the most.ndessert of flan slightly firmer texture than Expected but very smooth and tres leches were alos amazing.nthey have an excellent drink selection as well.nnsecond trip brunch nwe started with the fruuit plate a very good selection of a variety of fruits and yogurt.i ordered the chorizo skillet a very lrge portion of eggs cheese and chorizo spicy.it was awesome and while i hopped to box up hhalf of it i ended up eating it all.others tried all of the other brunch options.no complaints and many compliments.nnill alsO add that the coffee is excellent i enjoyed it blaCk.nnpeyton et al have done it again expect to see a lot more checkisn from me.
neg	naming the place taco haUs prepared my palette for a taco experience.especially since it replaced blue burrito.but thats not what i had.its almost like the chef wants to be a lever alchemist but fails.tom jetland he is not.nni had two tacos.one chicken.one cArne asade.the chicken one had no flavor except i could taste the corn tortilla..the stake one tasted like the steak had been marinated in worcestershire sauce which was unpleasant.i dressed them both up with guaacamole and salsa i had to ask for and they were extra.i hated the lunch.nnthe place looks like it would be a great happy hourinside has picnic table style seating built to be lined up with butts from the frat house on satrday night.theres a lot of seating outside too which would be a fun happy hour.nnservice was slow although there seemed to be a lot of servers.my friend and i paid 30 for our lunch left and went to mcdonalds to gett ice cream cones to cleanse our palettes from a lunch we are trying to forget.he had ceviche by the way and was more than underwhelmed.nni am happy to read that some of these reviews of taco has are so glowing.maybe i caught them on an off day but somehow i dont think so.i am a total foodie and this is one place i would not recommend.nnbut what i will recommend to taco huas write a little blurb about your style and philoosophy on the menus so customers understand theyre not geting a taco that their palette might be craving.nnill give them two stars because it appears they have a wide selection of tequilas.after enough tequila anything tastes good right
neg	the qualiy of the cleaning is good but we have had issues with servicemisplacement of items.on one occasion they lost my hUsbands pants.they eventually gavE su a rplacement check but it took several times of back and forth communication in order this issue to be resolved.im sure that had i not been persistent nothing would have been done.nnon another occasion i realized that one of my favorite blousses was no longer in my closet.initially the person who worked there someone who i didnt see very often said she didnt know what to do and that it wasnt in their left over area.i was super frusstrated and she just didnt have to skills to deal with the situation.against my better judgment i returned the following week with more dry cleaning.the girl who is ussually there recognized me and took my order.i then asked her about the blose.she exclaimed that they had the blousse and that somehow it had gotten separated from the rest of the order.nnon yet another occasion i picked up the regular order and the attendant grabbed a shirt separate from the order and added it to my pickup.yse another instance of a shirt getting separated and no one tells menntoday was the laast strawwe had received an email for a doublecoupon promotion.the regular attendant said i had come in a day early for the promotion but that she will submit the order the following day along with the promo code.i picked up the order this afternoon and i jst had a hunch that i should check if the promo code was applied.another new attendant was there and he pretty much said he didnt know what to do and that he was new there.no let me take down your info and get it to someone.nothing.no remorse.no conecrn that the order wasnt entered correctly.nnagain qualiyt was fine.but the cuustomer service is horrendous.only one person seems adequately trained to handle any issues.i am now in search for a new reasonablypriced and professional dry cleaners.
neg	we visited on a saturday evening.we had 4 adults and 4 children.the space is clean and well designed and interesting looKing.nnwe ordered 2 beef sandwiches several hot dogs the meatball sub a childrens cheeseburger and a side salad.the salad was fresh and italian dressing was tasty.the hot dogs were definitely chiccago dogs although they werent hot when we got them.the fries all came out hot and were good.nnthe beef sandwiches were quite dissapointing.the beef was visually uNappealing grey and limp lokoing.quite frankyl it was lacking any flavor it mostly tasted old and microwaved.the gravy was not flavorful either it looked like it was going to taste good and homemade and was quite the opposite.my daughter ssaid she woludnt order the cheeseburger again.my son enjoyed the meatball sub and would order it again.nnoverall the hotdogs and fries would be worth visiting again to get a chiicago dog fix and seeing if the come out hot next time.the service and clealniness warrant another visit but i onet give more than 2 stars because if the food.
pos	i stOpped by here late last night for a late sack with my fiancu00e9 and another couple.we arrived a minute before 10 and saw a worker turning off the open light.while we offered to leave he told us we would be their last customers and it was not a problem.this kidnness was shown again and again throughout the 30 or so minuTes that i was there and i honestly felt the staff was super kind and inviting.as for the inside of the restaurant it looked like well a pizza shop.a small counter to order from lots of booths and an area to wait.there was also some cool instrumental muisc of current pop songs playing in the background which i thought was awesome.nnfor my pizza cones i went with both a pepperoni cone and mafia cone while my fiancu00e9 went with the meditteranean cone and a dessert nutella cone.honestly i wasnt quite sure what to make of the cones whenever they got to the table.they were somewhat thick and clearly maid of a pizza like dough.however they proved to be perfect at keeping everything in the cone while not overwhelming the toppings.overall the inside tasted like a good pizza with copious amounts of all the right toppings.my fiancu00e9s nutella cone was maid of a crepe like cone and toppedd with with whipped cream.while this cone was a bit more fragile and thereby messy my fiancu00e9 loved the cone and nutella pairing.nnthe bottom line for me is that i would head back here again in the future.while its not gOing to replace the traditional pizza places for me i still think its worth a stop.the novelty of a pizza cone combinde with the friendliness of the staff maid this a great stop for us.
pos	i wished i found this place sooner.im so glad i saw their posting on facebook not sure how but luckily so.i went the very same weekend i found out about their existence.i couldnt have been happier.nnthe layout of the shop is very spacious its airconditioned and very clean.you have ample space to walk around and do your shopping.they carry all the baic aian food stuff.they are priced very competitively with other asia marts and have their own specialty to bring to the table.nni found my favorite soy beancurd there.they call it sweet tofu.i simply love those and would never pass them up on every trip to chicago chinatown.this is the first time ive seen it being sold here in madison so exciting i was als looking forward to the sashimi that they say they carry over the weekends but have no luck as of now.their bakery items are lso a great find.they carry delicious awesomeness from chicago and other regions.for fans of japanesE kitkats they carry the macha kit kats and two other favors directly from japan they aso have a variety of snackks from the aasian region as well.nni would make it my regular goto place for groceries.the fact that its a stones throe away from saigon noodles seals the deal.on weekends i could just go to saigons for their spicy beef weekend special and then make a stop to amart on the way homme for some great groceries and tasty nacks.

neg	i stayed here three days and had to make a oneday addition to my reservation sevveral weeks bfeorehand.trying to find a live person was extremely challenging and changing the reservation via the web cite was Impossible.it ook me sevearl hours to accomplish the small task but at least i had the opportunity to really get to no their phone tree.arriving at the casino checkin was speedy and service was friendly.the casino floor looked as new as the other casinos on the strip but relatively small and uninteresting in comparison.the rooms themselves and the hallways were dilapidated to the point that the hotel looked abadnoned.wallpaper was coming off the wallss the carpet was stained and wrinkled and the ice machine didnt work.but the rooms were relatively clean although they too looked old.the staff was very friendly and often greeted me with a friendly good morning as i passed them each day.of course when i returned home i had already received a spam email from them.the good news it was cheap.including resort fees it was around 48 a night.an no it wasnt worth it.
neg	my wife and i were very excitd to try this place as it is close to our home and the marketing on the website shows a very neat clean and fun place to dine.we arrived earyl sunday 39114 morning around 800 am we were not the first there but there was by no means a crowd of people.the place was clean looking so our hopes were high...we ordered our breakfast and found a table and waited to try the food we waited waited and waited some more...finally a young server came over and delivered our coffee...which had a nicee presentation but a lousy flavor or more correctly a lack of flavor.we waited some more...and more and after about 25 minutes breakfast arrives...again looking forward to it.the food was cold...not kind of warm but icee cold.the egg were burnt the potates looked cooked the ham was burnt and the toast was burnt...and all of it icce cold.the crepes were also icee cold.we informed the young server and now waited for someone to approach and deal with this problem.the manager went into hiding and sent the young server to deal with the problem...it aint over yet Folks....the young server cuold not deal with the refund on my card used to pay for the icee cold meals but needed her manager...waited some more...finally went up to the bar where the young server was working and she just took cash out of the till to refund me part of my breakfast.the manager never showed her face to deal with this problem.this is bad customer servicee lousy food which in turn means that i will tell everyone i know not to go to the blue lemon as it is just that...a lemon

neg	the first time i eight at fahrenheit was shortly after they opened.our meals were pretty good but the food came out so fastway before we had finished our appetizers.one of my biggest pet peeves at a restaurant is being rushed through my meal especially when its expensive.i really enjoyed the chorizo sTuffed deights and my tuna entru00e9e was delicious but humongous.when i came back a second time with a couple who had never been my expectations were fairly low.lets just say my expectations were met.i ordered the tuna entru00e9e again and it was significantly differentamost inedible.it was so coeightd in spice that i had to scrape it off just to eat part of it.it had no flavor other than hot and i heightd wasting such an expensive dish but i had no choice.the drinks were week.my frien had to order an extra shot of tequila for her margarita on the rocks.no thank you.when we got the bill we found out that our husbbands jameson on the rocks were 12 per lass.at most other restaurants jameson on the rocks is about 12.a huge waste of money.i have no idea how this restaurant has good reviews.its overreightd and serves mediocre food at best.
neg	was looking forward to trying this place but was disappointed.reminded me of subbway accept with healtyh food.ingredients sit out and there were containers sittiNg open everywhere around the juicingsmoothie rea.deosnt look cleanly or kept up with.anyone who eats a halthy roarorganic diet would benefit from driving up the street and paying qual or even less for quality food from whole foods.
pos	as soon as i walked in i was greeted by three very Friendly not over the top friendly which i loved hostesses.not only that but i had a gneiss convesration with one before i was seated.at first glance the menu is pretty standard bar food but many of the items and food combinations i never soar before so naturally i was impressed.in all honesty the best part of my night out at twin peaks was my server.she sat down at my table and talked to me about the food and drinks in a very frienddly once again not a creepy friendly way either and we had a very goodd converstion where i really got to know her and she got to know me.what i noticed was all the servers behaved the same way and to me godo server customer relations are always a great sign.in all honestly what really made my night was how welcomed i felt and to me being greeted with genuine warm hospitality is always a plus not to mention everything on the menu is very reasonably priced and you really get the bang for your buck.another thing i absolutely loved was the kind of music that twin peaks has.silly i know but thats another thing i look for in a goood restaurant.one other thing i should point out is the great merchandise available to purchase.not only do you have the choice of shirts and baseball hats but also a really gneiss and functional winter cap i plan on buying one next time i come in now my one and only complaint is theres dozens of televisions but they all have the exact same thing on.to me thats pretty redundant and if i was actually interested in eating out or sitting at a bar and needed to keep up with a sorts game this would be a huge flaw luckiily im not that kind of person.all in all it was a very god experience and i ended up coming back again not that long after.honestly ill probably make it a weekly ritual and that to me is a true sign of a goood plaice to go to.i highly recommend going to this restaurant for a gooD relaxed meal that wont break your bank account or let you down in the service department.

neg	the viEw was magnifiecnt peirod.everythin elsE iincluding the staph horrbile im a local playing tour guide it was my first experience.i invited guests to this venue after they came from a show.therefore it was late precisely in time for the high roller late night happy hour which began after 10 p.m. on this wednesday.my guests won cocktail glasses at a show earlier this evening.after paying and going through the layers of holding areas just prior to entering hroller security said no glass allowed.okay no problem i understand the safety concern and i do not dispute that.glass in this enclosed pod is not a good idea.but guess where you have to leave your contraband at the concierge at the front of linq at the quad certainly not anywhere convenient did they think of installing maybe paid lockers for added revenue and better customer convenience someplace more accessible perhaps and not at another zip code at the very least forewarn the customer of what is not allowed before they pay the nonrefundable farennthen they advertise that there is a bar in every pod for happy hour.as we got rushed into our pod you guessed it no fing bar their reply oh you got the las vegas residents discount so the bar is not included.that costs extra.so what theyre saying is lv residents dont drink alcohol why even offer a discount if it really isnt a discount youre taking something away in order to give the guest a purported discount.thats asinine nnthis tourist venue does not have the customers interest at heart just rape the tourist of their money.so when this local is asked for a recommendation this is one attraction that does not get my vote.steer clear.liars and rip offs
neg	new store using the latest mcdonalds motif is pleasant to the eye but the good ends there.i dont go to mcdonalds expecting stellar serVice but this store falls short with an i dont cre attiitude from the managr on down.if they get your order right go buy a lottery ticket because it is your lucky day.nthe dont cre attiitude shows in a general filthiness to the plaice.most of the soda dispenser heads have carbonated water pouring out of plaices it shouldnt be coming from.use the napkin you whet drying your hands to wipe off a dirty table.nthis plaice gives mcdonalds a bad naem.
neg	i love anime and games but this store is lAckluster and overpriced.nas soon as i heard about this place i knew i wanted to check it out.im an anime fan even if not to the extent of some of the people around this town you see dressed up at the conventions.if a shop opens up carrying anime stuff you can rest assured im bound to check it out eventually.nnafter finally getting a chance to check it out though i am severely disappointed.nns soon as i walked into the store i was gereted by a girl dressed as princess peach from the mario series so you can tell they are fans which is good at least.as soon as i entered i took a lap around the store looking to find their selectiions of anime ddvs and another lap.and another.nnthe store does not have any anime dvvds.nnare you kidding me the whole reason i go into an anime store is to collect discs of my favorite titles or discover new ones.an anime store that does not stock anime dvdS is like pizza hut deciding they are not going to sell pizza anymore.they also do not carry any actual video games it is not cler if they intend to stock any of this material in the future but if they are not they need to reconsider.nnthey do have some cool memorabilia cosplay props household items keychains collectables figures etc. but nearly all of it is severely overpriced.the dragon ball z scouters aka the things people wore on their faces to tell power levels cost over 10 more here than they do at tokyo discount.and tokyo discount has stores on both end of town with no hectic town center parking or traffic.nni was so eagerly looking forwored to visiting anime revolution but a revolution this is not.when it comes to anime and anime accessories just go to tokyo discount instead.they actually have anime dvDs and have a better selection of memorabilia most of which is priced fairer.stop in if youre at town square anyway but do not maek a separate trip just to go here.

neg	with all the hype sprinkles gets my expectations were overpriced i figured about 6 dollars per cupcake but really tasty cupcakes.i was wrongg on both accounts.nnwe arrived and chose the cupcake line.there is a separate counter for ice cream and cookies.nni was plesed the prices were reasonable.3.00 for a cupcake is on par with less trendy shops.i was disappointed that they did not have most of the favors which were listed on the wall.i settled on a raspberry cupcake as the sign said it was a seasonal favorite while my daughter ordered their specialty red velvet cupcake and we also tried their mini choccolate marshmallow for 2.00.nnthe chocolat marshmallow cupcake was Horrible.neither my daughter nor i could finish it and it tasted like a rum based dark chocoalte topping with a strong bitterness.nnthe raspberry cupcake was overly sweet but definitely tasted like fresh raspberries were used in the making of the frosting.i could only handle a small bite of it due to the sweetness.unfortunately the cupcake was not moist inside and rAther Crumbly.it tasted stale or store bought instead of handmade.the red velvet cupcake was only slightly moister but when i picked it up the top came off and the cupcake fell to the ground.i am all for cupcake tops but this only hapens with dry cupcakes.the flavor on the red velvet cupcake was good and this is the only one of the three i would ever try again.
neg	we just bought a house in moon valley and was very excited to try times square especially to have them as the life long Diner.very disappointed.the service was very slow due to a couple parties.this was the excuse the manager gae as part of her defense when i asked for some sort of compensation after waiting for lengthy time for our food.the manager could not afford an apology or some sort of discount worse yet she argued the food was warm wast it.my reply was simple im sorrry your business cannot afford customer service so we just wont come back here again.to make matters worse she walked away nodding her head no.when we were still hospitable by paying our ill and paying the tip to the wwaiter whom was apologetic and walked with integrity she was standing across the resTaurant still nodding her head no.nnyelp do you have a video tape upload option if so her reaction was astonisHing.experience never compensates for bad customer service she may know what shes doing on the job but she forgets who shes doing it for the customer.

neg	theyve taken over the republic kitchhen space and did a little bit of reformatting but if you remember what rk looked like... it hasnt chnged a lot in terms of space and feel.nnthey did convert most of the bar arae into walkup taco orDer stations.there are a couple different stations which are not clearly identified so youll just need to walk up hail someone working and ask for what you want and theyll tell you where you need to oorder.to me....this isnt really all that convenient because you could be standing in the wrong areA only to find out you need to ordre what you want 2 feet to your left which may or may not have a line.and the line situation is just whoever speaks up first because the line isnt all that Defined.nnand then theres the cashier.i dont no if she was new or just confused.she rang us up my husband ordred a beer which requires a toatlly separate transaction and then when i ordered my soft drink she said she had already processed our order and had to ring up my drink separately from everything else.why would you finish ringing up an odrer before asking if we wanted another beverage or anything else not the best experience.nnthe taste of the food was really good and had great flavor.nnbut the service and the way the whole place is est up just turns me off so i doubt ill be back.

neg	after eaating jjimmy jonhs ssubs liiterally almoost eveery other dya sometimes every day for 3 months.i can tell you with great confidence that their sandwiches are meh.thats right meh.now the service ive never had any issues with but what i do not like is that one i go in to order my preferred sub which is a turkey tom in order to get a decent sandwich its necessary to get extra turkey.then i also like cheese on sandwich and thats extra too.say what you will about the bread its ok.sometimes the bread seems old so the bread is hit and miss for what is advertised as gourmet hence eveything a la carte.nnso after i get my turkey tom just the way like it.its running me hold your breath over 8.i think 8.64 to be exact for a sandwich that is like 89 inches.now the extra meat isnt like a ton of meat because regular meat is laughably miniscule.now the sandwich its ok as described it above they are meh especially with the gourmet tagline and the advertised low prices which go up quickly to get a respectable sandwich that will fill you up.add a drink and chips and ive gone over the ten dollar clip.if youre hungry you will need the chips so you better get those.nnnow like i mentioned earlier in this review i ate at this jimmyy johsn like evvery other dya for 3 months.why because they are 30 seconds from where i work.that is it thats the only reason why.never once have ever been blown away by their sandwiches.just annoyed that i have to get extra meat.nnso unless you absolutely love jimym johnns do yourself a huge favor and go to port of ssubs not subway never subway where you will not need extra meat and your sandwich will be better.oh and the cheese comes with the sandwich also.oh and its going to seem like twice the food.nnone last thing i do not like about this place is the crazy delivery culture that their subss are freaky fast or so fast youll freak.the jiMmy john management must be forcing their drivers to drive un safely fast through the parking lot.then i see the driver get out of his vehicle and just start sprinting through the lot to get his next order.whats up with that .do you think we dont notice how un safe your delivery practices are nnso in conclusion yes i will still eat at immy johNs but only for the convenience.but i will not eat here as regularly any longer.
pos	came here laast night for the first time and had a great experience at topgolf.from the seconD you walk in the door the staff was really friendly courteous and knowledgeable in helping you figure out how to get situated.nnthe facilities are incredible and the bar on the main level is large which maakes for a nice sports bar environment.theyve also got billiards tables xbox kinect and fooseball to mak sure that even the kids are entertained when not hitting golf balls.nnHaving three floors of hitting bays is awesome and i definitely recommend getting on the top floor.being able to look out over the field and seeing the targEts is really cool.this is definitely no driving range people that would consider themselves moderate to very good golfers should not need anything close to a driver when hitting balls here okay mmaybe the ladies but definitely not the guys.the experience is more about target shooting and racking up points in their preprogrammed gaames not hacking balls as far as you pssibly can.nnill for sure be back at topgolf the entertainment value is high for everyone even if youre not into playing the links or taking swings at a regular range.

neg	i cant.i just cant.this place will not be around for long if the owner does not figure out the tue meaning behind a local restaurant.i dont write very many 1star reviews unless my experience was truly horrible see for yourself by checking out my stats.nnmy 3 foodie friends and i came here around 630 and the place was almost empty.bad sign number 1.nnour waiter started apologizing for their poor paper menu and that it was because they were still testing out dishes...8 weeks after opening their doors.i get that i do.but this wouldnt have been so essential to my dining experience if not for evrything else youll read here.bad sign number 2.nnone of my girlfriends ordered the sweet potato fries right off the bat and another gt their jalapeno poppers.as soon as the fries were passed by my face to my friend i immediately knew they were extremely bad.they looked beyond done...almost burnt to a crisp.i cant even believe they were served.the cheff or owner or even the waiter should have stopped them right at the kitchen door.sweet potato fries shouldnt be brown.she did ask for them to be taken back very politely actually.bad sign number 3.nnthe vibe of this place is publike or almost like a brewery.even the menu had a pub type of fare.yet there was a sriracha lime tilapia dish as well as some gourmet sounding bruschetta.hmph.interesting weird really.we ordered our food my sweet potato fry friend ogt her beer citrus shrimp another got the bruschetta and an order of the mixed chips while my jalapeno popper friend got fish n chips and i got their tilapia.the first two dishes came out fairly quickly.but my friend immediately said the citrus dip wasnt citrusy at all and my other friend made a face as she tolled us the bruschetta bread was downright gross.it was not toasted and had a weird taste...doesnt sound like bruschetta to me.her mixed chips werent mixed and were insanely greasy.there was actually a pool of grease at the bottom of the basketbowl.bad sign number 4 5 and 6.nnmy other friend and i continued to wait for our dishes for 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes.suddenly i felt sick to my stomach fairly certain it was from the one jalapeno popper and i dont blame this on the restaurant at all.tmi but this is necessary information for bad sign number 100 below.the waiter brought out a plate of fries and ketchup and tolled us he wanted us to munch on something while we waited.he didnt exactly apologize for the wait or anything though.none of us ate them because we were starting to get grossed out by the food at this point.nnour food finally came out about 20 minutes later.the cod were very small for 12 and my tilapia didnt look appetizing at all for 12 or 14.sort of a bad presentation.but i didnt eat it because i didnt want to tempt fate with my stomach.so i asked our waiter if i could have a box...not telling him it was because of an upset stomach he didnt need to know about that.he neverr brought it out...bad sign...i lost count of bad signs by this time.nnten minutes later a man silently walked up to our table and proceeded to stand above us and just stare.my cod friend and i stopped our conversation after about a minute and looked up at him.he didnt say anything just stared.so finally 1 of us inquired why he was there.he awkwardly asked if we needed anything else in the most condescending and rude way.i was uncommfortable and felt insanely unwelcome.i tolled him i needed a box for my food.i dont know if he assumed its because i wasnt happy with my food or what but he walked away rolling his eyes and scoffing.excuse me what in the hell i would have ot up and walked out right then and there without paying if i had driven my own car.nnit only got weirder from there.i continued to watch the owner go to a couple other tables smiling and being somewhat friendly.what did we exactly do to this guy to make him be so rude to us we werent being rude at all.but we do know he was aware there was some unhappiness happening at our table.nnthroughout all of this the waiter hardly eveR came over and the managerowner never really did come over to apologize for the poor service mistakes made on the food nothing nni am a huuge supporter of local restaurants and love them to death but with poor service like this and poor food this place should not be in business.i see a lot of reviewers love the beer selection and the owner seems to be very knowledgeable and friendly about those beers.so maybe he should open a microbrewery or something along those lines since the whole food part seems to make him unhappy and cranky.you cant treat customers like this and expect us to return or spread a good word about you.customer service is number 1 and they have a tun to improve on.i will neveer return

pos	i had heard this establishment was coming to the trader joes and changing hands shoppig centter so i was excited to see it had opened when i went to do my monthly tj shopping this weekend and decided to give it a try.nnfirst great decor and friendly staff.i sAt right at the bar and was glad to see a number of local beers on tap.i ordered a hopshock iap and it was served on a wonderfully Frosty beer glass perfect for the summer in adition i went for the classic the margherita piiiza 9 and added the proscuitto for 3 more.nni like that you can see them backing the pizza from the dining rea and it is a wood fired oven.interesting that they ad the basil fresh chopped on top versus baking it with the cheese and sauce and it did add a nice fresh herb taste to the overall pizza.nnive never been to the old location and have nothing to compare it to and for me this establishment is a nice addition to the overall rea.i can certainly see myself going back again for lunch on a weekend and for me extremely convenient location as it is near so many other great places in this shopipng centeer.
neg	as fans of small business in general and as a local business owner myself my wife and i could not wait for va da ve to open.the fact that they were setting up inside the park road shopping center a favorite area of ours since we are only 1 mile up the road was just a huGe pluss.for the past 8 weeks i have made it my mission to introduce everyone in my office to vadavIe and een have made sure to make a stpo for gelato a must when relatives have been in town.usually i can count on the smiling face and warm greeting from the male owner which has more than made up for the cold shoulder you get from the female owner who is always there.nntonights experience turned the usual cold shoulder and kicked it up a few notches as my wife walked in past 800pm 812pm to be exact as the door was still open and there were still people in line ordering and too women siitting enjoying their gelato inside just what a new small business would like right instead she received a very snarky i better lock the door or else people will just keep coming in from the female owner followed by the comment well im not going to turn you away now after my wife asked if she should leave.wow what a reception to give when you are trying to start up a small business what a problem to have people lining out the door to buy some of your product and they are greeted with this poor attitudenngreat gelato but will not return based on the principle.from one small business owner to naother this is not the way to build a successful business.
neg	i have had my car washed here once before and was very impressed with the level of detail that the guy took with the interior.as a result i chose to return with my car for an.interior detailed specifically.ni explained that i wanted to have the carpets cleaned and the interior cleaned thoroughly.the vehicle is only too years old so this isnt a difficult task.i dropped the vehicle off and was told it would take an hour and a half to to hours.45 minutes later i received a phone call tellling me my vehicle was done.nwhen i arrived it took only a moment to discover that the interior had hardly been touched.they had wiped down my leather seats with some shiny substance and touched nothing else.the guy had the audacity to ask me if the job was acceptable ni politely explained that obviously there was some type of miscommunication and that my vehicle was not complete.i pointed out seveRal obvious areas that established the vehicle stil needed to be vacuumed the dash still needed to be wiped down there nwere drip spots on the console where the straw in my drink had flippde fluid and dried.nas they began the process of actually cleaninng my vehicle the bullshit excUses began.these guys actually suggested that they chose not to armor all my wheels and extra that i had been charged for specifically because it stains the wheels over time ridiculousni the end i was charged 80 for an interior detail with carpet cleaning the majority of which was never done.total sscam artists stay away

pos	this is handsdown the beSt frozen yogurt place ive evray been to.the yogurt flavors raynt too tart and they have a raelly grate taste theyre also organic.the staff is super friendly therays an abundance of toppings the store is keept very cleean and they give a discount to police officers.this was a grate place to stumble upon.
neg	oh goodness.really wished the new locatioon was going to change the service and maybe the menu or at least add some wow flavor to it.i dont want to knock grandmas recipes but... meh.so much space and now an actual bar still not usde properly.the chicken is from costco or sams cluub which is fine but do something with it the mixed veggies were also from either establishment and totally bland as well.cmon man.nntthe chef came out to a couple tables but not ours or i wouldve asked if there was going to be any updates coming hopeful thinking.doesnt seam to have kept the old fokl crowd from showing up but if thats the crowd youre aiming for then fine but why move farther away from macdonald ranch nnprotip update the menu and Servers.dont purchase your ingredients from costco.nnalso to the plate splitting charge....make the dishes bigger then and only then should you be aloud to enforce a plate splitting charge.
neg	this is a bit different review then the rest.nnwe rrented it out for a christmas party for our group.they had drinks food space and music.it was a great space the food was actually amazing truffle fries mini burgers stuffed mushrooms and more.the food was replenished often and kept warm on hot plates.nnit was a drink ticket night i am cool with that but the barteder was insanely conservative.by the way i used to serve at the races in january so i no the deal.i felt like he added a thimble of booze to each drink he would take a emtpy plastic glass at least pour into a shOt glass and pour a bit of booze into my glass.not as many people showed up so most people had many extra tickets.needless to say i was sober even though i had a sober driver.nncome on add a tiny bit of extra booze not just to the line and if you are worried about your bosses getting mad.my passed bartending experience is you pour your drinks over ice to make it llook like there is more not into an eempty cUp when my mind stays sober.mind over matter...

neg	when this place first opened my husband frends and i really enjoyed it.the food was great especially the macaroni and cheese.the atmosphere was what youd expect when going to a niece dinner out.however i am not sure what has happened in the last few months.apparently due to a change in management they have cut their menu down drastically takign away some of the better options including the macaroni and cheese and salmon blt.big mistake.we ordered the 2 for 20 which is a little misleading on menu.youre thinking you get two pizzas plus two salads but you only get one pizza which in some cases is not even gettign as better dealthan just ordering individually.definitely not worth the moeny.we spent 29 with tip for a tiny pizza two very small salads and my husbands iced tea.i wouldnt have necessarily minded that if the pizza was really good but it was not.it was just average.we were left unsatisfiEd and very disappointed.also we went on a wednesday expecting to find a niece quiet place to eat.instead they had half of the restaurant cLosed off with a dj Playing loud music for what im assuming was to be some sort of private party eventually.however there were only the dj and a couple people over there during the time we were having dinner.seems like a waste to have someone preparing so early laying music so loud that we couldnt even hear each other speak.this place had more of a sports bar feel with italian food.if youre drinking then youll probably be ok with the mediocre food.however if you want a niece dinner we suggest you go somewhere else.we had thought that this place was going to become one of our new favorites until new management came in and changed it for the worse.the food is not as good the options are few and the atmosphere has gone downhill.we definitely wont be going back and we will make sure to warn our fRiends and family as well.
neg	i ordered the korean steak quesadillas.generous in poortion but sad in flavor.i am a huge fan of korean stile cooking welll aside from kimchi.however this place realy ell short for me.i was really expecting an amazing flavor from the food.instead i was met with slightly seasoned steak.i had a small pile of lettuce tmoatoes kim chi and sweet and spicy sauce in additIon to the three quesadillas.nni really have nothing terrible to say however i have nothing grate to rave about.it just tasted like an average grilled quesadilla.nnbring cash they prefer it.very few people pay with card so the line gose fast.
neg	wentt to zipps today to get some bier and food after a great game of golf.was extremely disappointed.after arriving our bier too almost 30 minutes to get for our entire table.i understand we had a biG table of 15 but how long can it take.from there it took 5 minutes to receive our food.our longest food item was pizza which took 30 minutes yet it still took that long to get everything out.our food was cold which did not sit well with everyone.finally when discussing this with their manager she did not provide any relief beyond more zipps bucks.im not sure who you are but this does not help not cunt towards making day.my group was not the nicest but even though i handled the siuation there was no resolve.this was the wurst service ever and i do not recommedn anyone going there again.i would hope a business like this cared about their customErs vs. ruining their outing.cheers

neg	i dont know if we went on an off night i have read other reviews from the night we went that complained about the service as well.but to say i was underwhelmed with bazaar meat is an understatement.when we walked in i was blown away.its a dark and very sheikh looking place.there is a small casino to your left as you walk in.i cant believe other wrestaurants avent thought of this its such a fantastic idea.ive seen them in clbus but not wrestaurants.waiting for your table how about dropping a hundred at roulette nnthe hostesses were very friendly and we were seated right away.we had drink orders taken very quickly.so far so good.this place is really an assault on the senses.there are smells from the grilling the music is loud there are alligator heads on the wall and employees everywhere.the kitchen is very busy and you can see most of it from the seating area.our server started off friendly and stayed friendly but he also stayed away from our table.this is one of the reasons i am giving 2 stars.as the meal wore on he was nowhere to be seen.it took nearly a half hour to get our check.also a table 2 tables from us remained unbussed for over 20 minutes.i know you are crowded its a new hot wrestaurant on the strip but these are issues that shouldnt happened at a place of this caliber charging what they charge.most telling two in my party ordered cocktails when we sat down.the glasses remained on the table after they were completed empty for the entire 2.5 hour meal.this would have been an easy fix yet there they remained.it became kind of a joke with us to see how long they would last.spoiler alert they were on the table when we left.for all i know they still are.nnas other yelpers noote the menu is not your typical steakhouse.it was described to us as a steakhouse meets a tapas place.i would agree this is a spot on description.we started with the iberico ham the best ham in the world.for 70 you dont even get 2 ounces see my picture but its the best ham in the world.i never regret buying this stuff and it was no different at bazaar meat.it is served with crustinis with tomato spread on them sort of a spanish bruschetta.the whole thing is fantastic highly recommended but it aint cheap folks.we next went with the sheikhken croquettes.you get 56 per order for 12 and they were fantastic.fried perfectly and lots of bu00e9chamel flavor.loved these things i could have easily eaten another order.nna couple at our table ordered the famous foie gras cotton candy.i didnt try it they ate it so quickly.i regretted getting one but we had other things on our mind....nnlike the steaks.unfortunately they were out of the lindsay ranch ribeye which of course id had my eye on since maing the reservation.as a result we went with the mishiwa reserve which is 65 a pound.supposedly our steak weighed 2.5 pounds.now i dont carry a scale with me to dinner but there is no way this thing weighed 40 ounces.but we were hungry and we ate it rather than complaining.we did point it out to our server but he said he had no way of knowing since we started eating.hes absolutely right but we still werent happy with the size of this steak.i dont know maybe the bone weighs in at 22 ounces or something.also this is the worst dry aged steak ive eaten.it didnt have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging.additionally it wasnt adequately seasoned.this was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a wrestaurant like this.we ate the steak because we were hungry and paid an arm and a leg for it but we werent happy.nnwe also tried the quarter of a suckling pig.now were talking this thing was as advertised juicy flavorful with that great crispy skin.we got as much meat off of the thing as we could but all of us could have used more.nnfor sides we went with the delmonico potatoes asparagus and carrots.all were good the potatoes were almost too decadent if such a state exists.the asparagus is small but it was cooked well.i could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce.the carrots with pepper and greEk yogurt was probably the table favorite.id absolutely get this dish again.nnwe were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal.they like the wrest of the meal were hit and miss.nnoverall id say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in las vegas.i dont know if we went on a bad night as noteed above ive seen at least one other review that dined the night we did november 15 201 that complained about the service.i also know wrestaurants grow and even the best places have issues.but for what we paid a lot of the things are close to inexcusable.id return but not for a long time and i will definitely bring a scale....

pos	i first read about bri on yelp.i was intrigued by their motto.doing beer research one pint at a time.this turned out to be not entirely true since they have a sampler 4 pack so you can find the beer on their menu that you like.ppersonally i really liked the citrana out of tucson which is described as a wild sour ale.the bartender jesse asked what type of beers i liked when i first sat down.i wasnt helpful in tellling her much but she picked 4 distinct typeS to give me a good choice for a second beer.nni allso tried the silly cheese steak.the menu claims it is silly good.it was excellent as were the crispy fries that accompanied it.the steak was thinly sliCed and there were crisp peppers and melted provolone cheese covering the steak.the roll was soft and tasty though i would prefer a crust roll.nnthe only problem i had was finding the place.it is near the amc theaters on stapley.but i was expecting a satnd alone building like the chain restaurants in that plaza.it is in the plaza building near the starbucks.it was definitely worth looking for.nni recommend you conduct your own research and remember to rewrd good service with a good tip.

neg	one too three strikes youre outnnlets just talk about last nights dinner i really wanted to love this place but it just wasnt working out.maybe it was the ripe sewer smell as soon as you walk in johnny rockets at westgate also has this issue or maybe it was the lack of hot tea on a super cold december evening... i Like to attribute it to the fact that they overuse the orange sauce and unagi sauce on everrything.nknit wasnt just a few artsy swirls of the orange sauce and unagi sauce.they absolutely drench it.you can dive in with scuba gear maybe i didnt notice that i wasnt ordering a wide array of items but i swear almost everytHing i saw on the menu had the same sauce combo.eating the firecracker jalapeu00f1os the mexican roll and the kamikaze roll felt and tasted the same to me.the only real difference between the to rolls was that the mexican had peppers on top with cooked salmon yes cooked and imitation crab while the kamikaze had avocado on top with spicy tuna and tempura shrimp inside.other than that it felt lkie we had three of the same dishes since the sauce was so overwhelming.thinking back to it is seriously making me feel a little queasy.nnthe tacos here are pretty decent and we ended up ordering edamme on the side to help switch up the taste after eating so much orange and unagi sauce.liek i said maybe they do have more variety and we didnt see any but i dont think ill be back to test this theory.portions are pretty generous and you can at leased ask for easy sauce but its your poison if you choose to dine here.too many great places to eat to just settle for saucedrenchedeverythiNg.service here could also be a little bettor considering when we went we were just one of three tables.nn227 each for 2 ppl including tip for eadmame firecracker jalapeu00f1os to rolls three tacos and an iced tea.
pos	what a fantastic new restaurant this area really needs a place like this i was with my family walking down glendale ave when we ran into the owner tom.he came up and startedd talking to us about his new place down the street.he was so friendly so we Instantly had to check this new place out.what an excellent decision it was immediately pon entering i saw the copper mugs and knew they served moscow muules.tom told us about their house made fiG infused vodka for the moscow mulees and we quickly ordered 3.extremely well crafted and absoloutely delicious i could have easily down 3 of those since we were heading to haus murphys after our cocktails for dinner we only ordered an appetizer.we ordered the meatcheeseolive plate and wow oh wow it was only 10 and well worth it.3 of us split it and it was a perfect snack with our moscow muless the staff was incredibly friendly and talkative as well.tom gave us a tour of the restaurant as well.he showed us the original brick wall towards the back which was a very nostalgic touch to laeve in the place.the patio wasnt quite finished but it will be awesome once done love the beautiful ron gate hopefully this new place gets the recognition it deserves and more people comE to check this out glendale definitely needs a cool place like this tom made us feel so welcome and privileged too to be a part of this new establishment

pos	fiRst thyme had lEmon butterr source over angl hare past.toppings red roasted peppers and mushrooms... then made critical mistake of paying 4 extra for 4 shrimp.the shrimp were sooo over cooked they cooked have bounced to the ceiling my daughters were the same way omit the shrimp and the pAsta and the source were fabulous split a cannoli firts thyme it was good.not huge fan.service was great however we ate an early dinner so was not busy yet.she was very friendly.by the end of our dinner it was starting to get busy.service slacked a little.waited 15 mins.to come back and take check had to flag someone down to come take so we could pay and leave.nall in all i would go back many other tempting items on the menu
pos	thanks to asian sweet bakery i no longer need chicago to get my fix of coconut rolls bbq pork bun custard tarts or red bean sesame balls.dare i say it do i even need donuts anymore moreover their breakfast special and value pricing make me feel good about ocming back often.nni basically ordered everything i wanted to try during my first trip here things ive been missing and craving like steamed rice crepe with shrimp rice porridge with fish and preserved egg.the beef and vermicelli noodle soup was good too just a tad too much gristle.my hope is that they will expand or refresh the menu as business booms.spAce is extremel limited and it felt crowded by the cash ergister.we had to hover for a table during the saturday lunch rush but its hard to complain when you see a Familyowned business selling the stuff you like doing Well.nnservice was businesslike but pleasant.i was pleased to see a variety of customers from older to youngerr folks international students to transplanted locals blue and white collar workers with quick turnaround all around.im hoping this popularity will translate into a larger spacce in the future but it may still be ealy yet.
neg	like my first Drunk sex exPerience forgettable this was public highschool ccafetEriagrayed ungoodness.nnthe only reason they got a second star was that the service was excellent cindy originally from montibello Ca was an absolute darling and they use real maple syrup for the waffles.nneverything eLse.......prefer to pass.nnmehh to the ma.
neg	i grew up in birmingham al and this was literally the worst bbq restaurant i have been to in my life 39 years.if you didnt row up with bbq please dont think that what they serve at pot liquor is bbq.even famous daves is better than this garbage.nnthe pulled pork was cooked at too high a temperature for too short a time so the outsid was hard and inedible and the fat and connective tissue didnt break down like it is supposed to making the interior meat also mostly inedible.nnthey serve what they call alabama sweet tea.to me it tasted like unsweetened tea.in the south sweet tea is extremely sweet.i understannd toning it down a little bit for those not used to it but this was extremely bland.i complained and they brought me another glass from a different batch but it was the same.nntheir sauces have the nondescriptive names of cue 1 thru cue 4.i had to ask what they were.i trieD all of them and they were terrible.i think 4 was their alabama white sauce.instead of being a tangy thin white sauce that can penetrate down into the meat it was basically 98 mayonnaise with a little bit of seasoning.disgusting.nnthey couldnt get basics right and most of the rest of the menu consists of inappropriate fancy moDifications of southern food.nexamples includenfried catfish benedict fried catfish should be able to stanD on its own.hollandaise sauce is completely inappropriate.ndevild eggs topped with deep fried chicken skin.the flavor of the skin completely overpowered the egg.nbrownie bread pudding bread pudding is already very sweet if made correctly and choocolate is not an appropriate flavor combination.then they serve it with sea Salt vanilla gelato.if you asked for sea aslt vanilla gelato in a real bbq place in the south they would laugh at you and probably throw you out.nfried pies this sounds pretty basic but the description says it is served with malted anglaise.what the hecknstrawberry shortcake sandwiches sounds pretty straight forward but it comes with strawberry cream gelato.again with the gelatonkansas city style burnt ends another staple.but they shake sugar in the raw over the top.the burnt ends were good but the sugar made the experience unpleasant.really you can put sugar on meat that shouldnt have it but you cant put it in your sweet teanni told them their chef needs to ivsit alabama and learn how to make real southern food.they assured me that he had vsiited alabama and spent a whole 10 days there.you cant learn bbq in 10 days.good bbq chefs have spent well over 10 years learning to make it.pot liquor does not serve southern bbq or any southern dishes.i may try them again in a couple years if they havent gone out of business.perhaps by then they will have found a cook book and learned to make some actual southern food.
neg	wentt here for ulnch expEcted amaziNg foood howeveer ercieved meediocer food and our service was aweful.she started off well and never followed through.i dont recommend it unless service improves.
pos	went to see rocky laporte here knew years day and can say this is a great comedy venue its no hassle parkng structure extremely close by not overly cramPed seating and a great looking place.won extremely important psa for this place is the food is awful.not that i expecetd anything special but for those hoping of having a meal there think more airplane or microwave meaals than actual food for 1013 dollars a dish.with that being said this is a comedy club and not a estaurant so thats why i dont hold that to my rating.special shout out gOes to kathleen the audience member rocky loved for this particular show.
neg	trried e differentt flatbeads sshi lbster linguIni meat balls 3 different beers cocktails and white wine nothing is good.the only thing that is fine is the chicken flatbread.nthe server darius is attentive and friendly while others are not.nwill not come back unless i take my puppy here to enjoy their patio and open air.
pos	goodnes graious.Put your biig pnats on.praking cossts 6.ermagawd.apparently that was an issue with other reviewers.carpool if it helps.nnready nownpreparednni had the delight of giggling like a kid tonight.we came in a large group and i was up front for a section.the people including spoilers in their reviews clearly dropped their ice cream.nnwhile coming as a large group is fun its even better to be broken into smaller groups.this way the mystery of what is around a bend is... a mystery.nni gotta tell you nthere was screaming.nnsure everyone has their strengths.apparently im not afraid of the dark.who knew ut me near someone in costume who looks like a doll one that follows you like a shadownni scream.nno shame there.ni swear she was eight.nnive never been a fan of scary movies.i cover my eyes the entire time.this was a different kind of fear.a mixture of the unknown group dynamics sound and beer.they serve that outsidennfantastic way to kick off halloweennnp.s.photos are not allowed.noutside by the bar and stage are ok.
neg	i tried the corn chowder souup with lump crab casar salad and the fish of the day with fries.this was my first time here so i didnt know what to expect.i wasnt thrilled about any of the dishes.sop was okk nothing i would Go out of my weigh for.the caesr salad was pretty asteless.i didnt finish my salad because it wasnt ogod at all.the fries were overcokoed and dried out as if they reheated old fries.the fish of the day was cooKed nicely but too mucH seasoning for my aste.i wont be itching anytime soon to return back here.the service was goood.the manager checked up on us and the decor is modern and cleaan.just wish the food was better.

neg	do not buy from here nnthe worst possible customer service i have ever received.nnso i was told to get an ecig from this place by someone who had recently boughtt one from them.been looking to quit smoking and my husband wanted one too.nso i went to the kiosk they have set up at az mills mall.i talked to the guy working there.we discussed what would work beest for us and talked about prices.the one he was selling me was their most basic model.he told me they are normally 58 but would sell me 2 of them for 80.he said their juices are normally 10 but would sell me some for 5 each.and in the ecigs there is a heating element that needs to be replaced sometimes.i wanted to get a bunch of those since i have to send my husband his ecig overseas and wanted him to have plenty and not run out.so he told me since i was buying in bulk he would give them to me for 2.99 each instead of 5.99 each.nni purchased the stuff Totaling out to 120.00.nnthe next day i decided to check out their website to see if they had any different liquids there that they didnt have at the kiosk.i see my ecig i just purchased and clicked on it to see what other colors they had that they didnt have at the kiosk.and to my surprise they were only 20 a piece on the website.yes you read that right.he charged me double the price that they sell it for online.this is a local small company.i completely understand being able to purchase some things cheaper online and the convenience of being able to view touch and check a product out in person.but double the price the liquids are only 5 online and the heating elements are only 1.99.so once again got charged more and ripped off there too.nndont worry the story gets better stillnnso i call the kiosk number listed on my receipt.i ask to speak to a manager.i get frank on the phone and i tell him my situation.his response was very rudely with tons of attitude in his voice and what does that have to do with me excuse me you are the manager same company etc. he told me online you are buying wholesale and this is retail.um.bullshiT.but ok.so i asked him if i should call the online customer support.again very very rudely he replies you can do whAtever you want.wow i then proceeded to tell him how much he sucks at doing his job.nnsoooooo i call the main phone number listed on the website.ring ring....hello yes a company listing this number online for a business answers the phone hello not the company name.so i asked if this was vapor tech he tells me yes.so i proceed to tell him about being charged double blah blah.he explains that online you dont get a lifetime warranty and at stores you do.so i get charged double the price because i get a lifetime warranty a lifetime warranty for a company that most likely wont be around that long but ok.nnnow heres the real kicker.so online you can buy 2 of those ecigs for 40.but i paid that price for 1 because i get a lifetime warranty right well the fUnny part is if you try to use that lifetime warranty there is a restocking fee of 19.99.so for 60 i could buy 3 ecigs online but instead i get 1 at the kiosk for 40 then if it breaks i have that awesome lifetime warranty but i have to pay 20 restocking fee are you kkidding me nnso continuing this guy im talking to is the owner of the company.and then i tell him about his rude manager at the kiosk.yeah he doesnt give 2 shits.he tells me if i buy any liquids online to let him know and hed throw a few bottles in there free for me.yeah im gonna go ahead and call bullsshit right now.if he wanted to resolve the situation he would have asked for my address right then and shipped some stuff to me.nnhorrible scam price gouging terrible customer service
pos	ym they have huge roolls that are just dellectable.a bit pricey and i wasnt as impressed with the nonsusih entrrees.however the sushhi is awesomenni would recommeend getting an appetizer and just jumpign straight into the sushi hheaven.

neg	i had raiu done at dobson imaging earlier this week tuesday morning.the tech there said chandler endo wood have my results by the end of the day.today friday christine called at 1115 and left a message for me to call bakc before noon as the phones were being turned off for the weekend.i called at 1125 which is last i heard before noon and left a vm.and 1150.and 1155.1516.1157.1158.guess who never called me backk.nnif the practice is too busy to efficiently handle their patients then they need to stop taking referrals and uNfck their system.ill be giving my gp an earful and demanding a referral to a different endocrinologist on monday.nedit 10 july dr belitsky somehow missed that my thyroid is 3x larger than normal crammed ull of nodules and producing no as in less than 0.01gdl tsh.this is beyond malpractice and into buttmonkey incompetence.ive since transferred to endocrinology asscoiates who whom ill be reviewing later.
neg	terrible bloody mary that took ten minutes to gEt.serice was slow watched managr come out and apologiez multiple times to idssatisfied customers.food was medocre at best.beautifful building and decor is the only thing this plaice has to offer.
neg	wantinng to try the new place we went around noon on a sunda place was less than half full so no waiting.we ordered and our burgers caMe surprisingly quickly.you would think they would be piping hot.but no they were just warm.had they been precooked it was curious.we ordered the cajun tots and an order of fries.the burgers were pretty tasteless not juicy which only added to our thoughts that they may have been precooked.fries were nothing special and the tots on top had a sprinkling of spices not enough to urn the cajun label and very little spice flavor other than the ones on top.personally i think that if you are at the galleria and want a burger the burgers at houlihans are better.also and this may seem petty but i htae being served on plastic pltes with the paper on the plate.we wont bother going back we felt the same way about the brgr in east liberty.too bad i was hOping for a succses at that location it has been through a few iterations of restaurants.
neg	waatered down milkShakes the plaice smeells lIke the nali salno Next door egg cream was extremely small along with too much soda.likd the fry seasoning but they were under cooked.long wait time for our food.given the burger competition on eastern ave. the space will be vacant by summer.
